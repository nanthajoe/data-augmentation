"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, the boat was already on its way out lol"
<|emo_disgust|> It’s ugly. Bye bye and good riddance.
"<|emo_disgust|> I feel like [NAME] was impossibly bad enough to warrant memes about him. [NAME] is just bad, boring, and too invisible to really hate."

"<|emo_disgust|> Thank you. [NAME] killed it, earned his spot. Love my packers but sometimes people in this sub are ridiculous "
<|emo_joy|> Royals can be prosecuted. Princess [NAME] was charged under the dangerous dogs act many years back the monarch enjoys sovereign immunity.
"<|emo_joy|> Very cool toys, very cool video, very cool hostd"
"<|emo_disgust|> Way to cherry pick. Remember that time that [NAME] person got lit up for like, 9 goals against or something? Man, that guy sure sucked."

"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I might actually watch this weirdo movie this time. "
<|emo_anger|> I really hate ginger ale. With a passion. The scenario in that scene makes me sick to my stomach.

<|emo_anger|> Game: ok get out now Nea: a Game: no fuck you nea u toxic af
"<|emo_surprise|> Kinda surprised he listed [NAME] and [NAME] in particular, but not [NAME]. I guess this is the Leafs spotlight working in real time here."

"<|emo_surprise|> A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one."
<|emo_joy|> Just woke up from one. Glad to know it's not just me. Hope you have a good return!

<|emo_joy|> It's honestly the best news I've heard all season.
<|emo_surprise|> Ah the high life. Must be sweet.
<|emo_anger|> I'm trying to get you laid. Maybe then you'd stop acting like the giant douchebag you are.
<|emo_joy|> I said this somewhere else.. but I swear that man in the hood is caucasian... But that was actually hilarious
<|emo_fear|> I got mine a few months ago and honestly apprehensive to wear it out to a game in fear of staining it.
"<|emo_fear|> Matchroom squad dismiss [NAME] as not existing anymore, the sky media influence is scary "
"<|emo_sad|> This is why, when I do it, I'm gonna do it as quick and brutally as possible. This is inhumane."
<|emo_fear|> Not even polite if they're driving. The road rage here is terrifying.
"<|emo_disgust|> ""I shouldn't have done that, it's not the honorable way."""
"<|emo_surprise|> Its horrifying to think about getting separated from your family, friends and the culture you were living into somewhere new and unfamiliar just like that"
<|emo_anger|> How dare you

<|emo_disgust|> Honestly I’ve seen kids that age do really gross stuff

<|emo_anger|> Fuck a newspaper
<|emo_joy|> Super excited to watch them in Syracuse next year. Might actually spring for season tickets
<|emo_fear|> You've aged horribly'
<|emo_joy|> Pleasure to meet you brother
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] can’t space and [NAME] is getting worse defensively
<|emo_anger|> Then you’re entirely ignorant
"<|emo_joy|> We're are going on a trip, in our favorite rocket ship"
<|emo_fear|> Because it's incredibly cringy.
<|emo_anger|> Imma upvote the hell outta this. I’m saying this as a Flamer fan
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] keeps getting set to get a rebound [NAME]
<|emo_joy|> I love the post you just made! Well written and very relatable.
<|emo_sad|> Honestly it makes me sad but [NAME] does need less time:/
<|emo_anger|> WHAT THE HELL?!?!?!?
<|emo_fear|> This is so scary. Keep safe! I would put fencing up and become a licensed carrier at that point. Sounds like crazy druggies!
<|emo_disgust|> Because what you're doing is disgusting and an insult to humanity.
<|emo_joy|> I’m so glad I’m not the only one. Since everything happened I’ve always thought I was just overly sensitive
<|emo_anger|> Meryn fucking Trant? Any boy whore with a sword could beat three Meryn Trants.
<|emo_disgust|> People are disgusting and insane.
<|emo_sad|> Yeah its too bad that there was someone at a university who wanted to research this and he got shut down.
"<|emo_anger|> You really don't comprehend anything my man, now do you? Goodness gracious the amount of stupidity. "
<|emo_anger|> I despise [NAME] and all his cronies
<|emo_disgust|> It's a shame that so many experimental psychology studies are still using such dubious statistical practices.
<|emo_joy|> I enjoy shouting this at my husband and our friends when they're being especially nerdy.
<|emo_joy|> [NAME]! You made me the happiest girl that could eva be!
"<|emo_sad|> Waiting for it to get better as it’s been getting progressively, exponentially worse for 7+ yrs now"
<|emo_anger|> You fool! Now look what you've unleashed!
<|emo_surprise|> Is this a real thing!?! (I am clearly very sheltered)
<|emo_surprise|> AT doing some work!
<|emo_sad|> I’m sorry if you’re comparing institutionalized slavery where you can murder thousands to community service you’re an asshat
<|emo_anger|> Fucking [NAME]. It's always [NAME].
<|emo_fear|> That’s a terrible amount of bp for 11 kills
<|emo_joy|> Honestly [NAME] is just enjoying his 350k and sits at home to play Fortnite ar this point. He’s done for

<|emo_joy|> I’m so glad I have my own car
<|emo_sad|> Yeha he failed to qualify unfortnatwly.
<|emo_joy|> My dad was on 20+ narcotics for over 20 years. Now he just smokes pot and I've never seen him happier
<|emo_surprise|> Who da fuck wears swim trunks to a competition
<|emo_anger|> Time to cut him off. Or find a way to get him good help. Cause he sounds a little dangerous.
<|emo_disgust|> Ugh I've had my mirena for a few years. I get none of bleeding and all of the cramps
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] playing for the heat always makes me laugh
"<|emo_anger|> It’s all the anger, it ages her terribly "
<|emo_sad|> I try to get close but I get pushed away. I try to back away and now I've just backed away.
<|emo_anger|> The car analogy is silly because car problems are physical and material and hence clearly factual diagnosable. “Toxic masculinity” is a squishy theoretical concept.
<|emo_disgust|> Absolutely terrible. But wholesome aswell.
<|emo_sad|> TBH I was worried he actually hurt [NAME]. Glad everyone is ok.
<|emo_surprise|> Her dad must be a gorilla who’s in to bondage.
<|emo_fear|> Tell that to r/Polygrumps (very *VERY* NSFW) dude. They scare me more than this sub.
<|emo_disgust|> LOL how can anyone trust you when you pretend that you voted for [NAME] when your clearly racist against blacks. Your user name is strictly a lie.
<|emo_surprise|> Surprising you choose to believe things that aren’t true 🤔
"<|emo_surprise|> What an incredibly well thought out response, totally related to the character and moves that were previously being discussed"
"<|emo_anger|> Watch out, [NAME]!! [NAME] is right behind you. Oh god oh fuck he can’t hear us, he has AirPods."
"<|emo_disgust|> This made me lol, I don't want to sound racist but.... *goes completely ham with the racism*"
<|emo_disgust|> Fox News attacked [NAME] for a fist bump. The absurd attacks were directed from the very top of conservative media.
"<|emo_disgust|> ""Lazy ass"" Oh my, the irony"
<|emo_surprise|> Wow you’re mom is truly living by the love first motto that is [RELIGION].
"<|emo_anger|> Look [NAME] is here ""Where the fuck was he an hour ago, gary, where!?"""
<|emo_joy|> I love rock music but I enjoy draft punk too.....*feels bad man*
<|emo_joy|> I mean if my wife looks like that when I get married then I’ll be quite happy.
<|emo_fear|> It's tasty. Had one on bone marrow once. I've had weirder things before
<|emo_disgust|> Bitch yes!
<|emo_anger|> Damn for that much you may as well use a mobile plan unless you're doing something latency sensitive.
<|emo_surprise|> I'm beginning to wonder how I lived before without these daily posts.
<|emo_disgust|> holy crap that's messed up.
<|emo_joy|> Very good to know! Thanks!
<|emo_anger|> HOLY SHIT CHANCE
<|emo_surprise|> This sentence has a very different meaning in Australia.
"<|emo_joy|> Thank you for writing this, for letting us into your world so that we can better understand our own. I am very grateful for this gift."
<|emo_joy|> happy to help
<|emo_sad|> I just watched this episode twice and I already miss him. Restart the series.
"<|emo_anger|> Yeah, he's trash. "
<|emo_fear|> 70% tax rate is a terrible idea
<|emo_sad|> As high as ~72% in black families. Truly heartbreaking what the expansion of the welfare state has done to the black family.
<|emo_sad|> I think it's safe to say I've peaked. 16/25 on the second half wouldn't all that surprising but I probably whiffed on [NAME]
<|emo_anger|> You’re trash april. I’m November 2000 actually. Damn we’re old.
"<|emo_joy|> I'm not sure these guys are wingers, but other than that, I'm very happy so far"
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] sounds happy to be back! So glad we have the full crew today!!
<|emo_joy|> By taking it as a nonserious game you don't need in order to enjoy and have fun with it.
"<|emo_anger|> > weird ass-coments *** ^(Bleep-bloop, I'm a bot. This comment was inspired by )^xkcd#37"
<|emo_anger|> Wtf is a weeb
"<|emo_disgust|> They're all bad enough to be lumped in to the same category? You either have very high standards, or none at all."
<|emo_disgust|> My dad doesn’t believe in climate change. This is way too accurate.
<|emo_joy|> Happy just came out
<|emo_disgust|> i would not vote for him
"<|emo_disgust|> Is pleading the 5th even legal? I mean, people should be forced to defend themselves even from erroneous claims."
<|emo_anger|> Thank you I hate it
<|emo_anger|> ONLY FUCKING MERRILL WOULD MISS THAT
<|emo_sad|> You lost everything. So sad. Lots of lies from you. Next time do better. I love this. Friend. :)
"<|emo_sad|> Yeeeaaahhh.... ""protect""... I'm pretty sure this guy has a rape dungeon filled with schoolgirl body-pillows in his basement."
<|emo_disgust|> Good [NAME] we look horrible
"<|emo_anger|> *youve doomed us all, evacuate the continent immediately*"
"<|emo_joy|> I need more videos of this cat, love its face xD"
<|emo_anger|> >How do you know I didn't Because you posted this dumbass post. And only someone who didn't would say that
<|emo_anger|> Problem is as soon as someone criticises Israel they jump up and down and scream anti semitism
<|emo_surprise|> This is so true!! I'm vaping mango right now! Weird... Wish I was a kid.
<|emo_joy|> That's good to know
<|emo_sad|> I feel that nobody cares and nothing will be different because this is a total non issue for vast majority of people.
<|emo_surprise|> Or we could just get menus with pictures of food like every other rational establishment. It's so bizarre
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] IS STILL THE ONLY QB IN THE NFC NORTH WITH A PLAYOFF WIN!
"<|emo_anger|> Me, because I'm a narcissistic bastard."
<|emo_sad|> OW MY LEG!
<|emo_anger|> But it's still raping infantry. The case rounds OHK infantry up close. It's just horrendously weak against planes now...
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] here...that guac looks horrible
<|emo_disgust|> It's weird that actual socialists will say that politics has moved far to the right.
"<|emo_sad|> It's not like the picture looks bad. Wait, no, I take that back immediately. I can't unsee it now too."
<|emo_disgust|> He also does not care much for his mother because she knew Dr. [NAME] was lying. Just your typical leftist bully who hates his family.
<|emo_disgust|> 3 Hours of [NAME] pissing on the floor in public
<|emo_joy|> I feel for the dad curled up at the end of the bed like a loyal dog
<|emo_joy|> Wow!! very funny
<|emo_anger|> Yeah it sort of sucks now.
<|emo_disgust|> She's one among 435 members of the House. You're giving her an awful lot more authority than she actually has.
"<|emo_joy|> Searching is fun, and finding and learning all the spawns is satisfying."
"<|emo_anger|> Thanks, I hate it."
<|emo_sad|> You may have been watching a tad too hard bro lol No judgment here
<|emo_fear|> She’s horrible
<|emo_anger|> Well you're lying about my pun being better bitch
"<|emo_fear|> The problem they have is... They ""knew"" [NAME] would win."
"<|emo_anger|> Hi, female prostitute for sex work here. Can you not with this angry and condescending attitude? Not good camaraderie, comrade."
<|emo_anger|> The bears still suck. The bears still suck. They really really really really really suck. The bears.... still.... suck
<|emo_joy|> Happy cake day!
<|emo_joy|> You got a friend in meeeee...
<|emo_fear|> Wow .. this is more terrifying than if they were a ghost ! Amazing twist
<|emo_sad|> Damn this guy just had a bad day!
<|emo_joy|> I love how the sun just decides its going to pull Australia from Earth and cuddle with us... If only it didn't burn so much.
"<|emo_disgust|> Accounting. I love the work, hate the people and the environment."
<|emo_anger|> A fucking power outage during a hurricane and your car is fucked.
<|emo_anger|> He was aggrieved that people didn’t recognize him and recognized steroid users instead.
<|emo_surprise|> Lol what an edgelord
"<|emo_joy|> No, that looks h*ckin delicious "
"<|emo_disgust|> Girlfriend weak as well, that jump was pathetic."
"<|emo_joy|> supernova AOC <3, the lies the media gets away with. Glad someone is talking back with real umph"
<|emo_sad|> I feel left out... I never get invited to our new world order meetings with our elders of zion
<|emo_sad|> I made a severe and continuous lapse of judgement....
<|emo_sad|> Why do we even try to have nice things T_T
"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, she was gonna clobber that punk with the butt of that gun."
<|emo_anger|> I'm appalled that your roommate straight up destroyed perfectly good leftovers that way
"<|emo_sad|> It's not about fixing anything, it's about making the wicked suffer."
<|emo_joy|> I’m happy I can help.
"<|emo_joy|> *""Wow""*"
<|emo_joy|> Same here! Although I just try to be happy whenever I am with my child.
<|emo_anger|> I really hate this jersey and it just doesn't seem like a Sabres logo despite being the most accurate to the name of the team.
"<|emo_sad|> correct me if i’m wrong but when [NAME] eliminates [NAME], she technically has a better track record than [NAME]?? i’ll fucking cry"
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME]: ""Why do people think we're a bunch of wackos that do dumb shit all the time?!"" Also stoners:"
<|emo_anger|> Except [NAME] is worse
<|emo_anger|> “How dare you use your breasts for their biological function instead of my enjoyment!”
"<|emo_disgust|> holy shit that's bad, maybe the extremist right can't meme either?"
<|emo_sad|> Running. That’s all. And then I hurt a major tendon.
<|emo_disgust|> The humidity in Sydney is worse.
<|emo_surprise|> It’s shocking if you’re a bad electrician.
"<|emo_joy|> I’m really excited for this year! Especially the Wu Lin hero , I can’t wait to wield my double-handed jian😍😍"
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is a fucking STAR
"<|emo_fear|> I mean, a lot of animals I've seen get terrified of regular stuffed animals, imagine having your fears super sized like that"
"<|emo_sad|> I'm so sad for you, I'm so so sorry. 💔"
<|emo_disgust|> It certainly reeks of the same kind of scam.
<|emo_anger|> Come back here and fight me m8
<|emo_joy|> Yeah I'm glad he got caught. What a piece of crap.well at least he won't be a virgin in jail anymore haha
"<|emo_disgust|> In other words this looks bad, so we’re trying to distance ourselves from it. Yeah too bad NRA. Zero sympathy from here. "
<|emo_anger|> The first comment wasn't but when you not wanted you should just fuck off
<|emo_surprise|> What a confession! Unbelievable!
<|emo_anger|> Only a sith deals in absolutes.Fuck that guy.
<|emo_surprise|> Seriously? In Dutch right? Because... he's so awkward on his YouTubes in English.
<|emo_anger|> Sounds like a great way to accidentally fucking kill someone who might just be passing by.
<|emo_anger|> Cats! I'm fucking sold!!
<|emo_anger|> THAT'S NOT HOW THIS GAME WORKS.
<|emo_disgust|> Oh she despises them
"<|emo_anger|> She doesn't sound like a good girlfriend then, assuming you've done nothing to warrant such jealousy."
"<|emo_joy|> I work 12 hour shifts, and agree. Tea is life-saving."
<|emo_disgust|> Sadly I know lots of peeps that would find this dude hot. He has that LA 90’s Persian chic thing going for him
<|emo_sad|> A few years ago a lot of shows tried to do a “second screen experience”. It didn’t work and died a quiet death.
<|emo_sad|> I can't remember a time during my early childhood where I didn't dress up like my mom and almost break my little ankles in her heels
"<|emo_disgust|> He was playing with absolute garbage teammates, and the one year he was on a decent team he had 44 points in 48 games. "
"<|emo_fear|> That woman gave me nightmares as a child. Also, you probably know this but she also plays [NAME] aunt in the third movie!"
<|emo_anger|> By the end I was I hysterics. Not a single reply from the wife too.
<|emo_sad|> I know but it just sucks to feel like this
"<|emo_joy|> Same. It's rare we get rain, might as well enjoy it. I sure did during yesterday's hike."
<|emo_anger|> The USA welfare spend is quite low per gdp compared to first world countries. The safety nets are ridiculous or nonexistant and the inequality is ridiculous...
<|emo_sad|> Same. And then cried a little.
<|emo_fear|> The biggest Nightmare
<|emo_anger|> She’s the sister of the [NAME] that killed [NAME] brother!
"<|emo_fear|> Maybe crotch-thrusting ""power pose"" on top of the White Cliffs will scare them all away?"
<|emo_disgust|> That thigh gap not cute at all
<|emo_sad|> Something something broken arms
<|emo_disgust|> Making DC climate an unapologetic brutality with blistering dry winds and no snow on a typical day.
<|emo_joy|> That’s horrible. You definitely didn’t deserve it. I’m glad to hear you’re doing OK now.
"<|emo_anger|> The trouble is, he ate the ice-cream anyway. Some fucking moral fortitude right there."
"<|emo_sad|> Probably. Sorry, OP. But don't worry. A lot of us are in the same boat."
<|emo_fear|> That movie really scared me when I was a kid.
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh man, I didn't expect that: It kept rolling on his face!"
<|emo_anger|> Upvoted twice because this is EXACTLY what they think it is and it sucks rat balls.
"<|emo_surprise|> >Also, you realize that both parties largely dabble in identity politics. Oh absolutely! It's a major reason I hate [NAME]. "
<|emo_joy|> OH MY GOD! The PTA has disbanded! Ahh! Ahh! AHHHHH •jumps through window•
<|emo_surprise|> That's really interesting! I've seen that happen before too
<|emo_joy|> For a sec I thought I was on NoSleep. I'm glad no one got hurt.
<|emo_joy|> And that smilie she gave the fiancé when he sat down with the sandwich....I would be scared if I was him.
<|emo_fear|> *6 objectively [NAME] and [NAME] are terrible at their jobs.
<|emo_sad|> Just life.. I feel like i'm just a parasite that should be removed.
<|emo_disgust|> a celebrity i like had his appendix out and tweeted about how surgery left him with an ugly belly button 🤣
"<|emo_disgust|> The last book feels like a dream. It's ridiculously bad, imo "
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] they need a union so badly.
<|emo_joy|> *Hey just noticed..* it's your **2nd Cakeday** yosoyjackiejorpjomp! ^(hug)
"<|emo_fear|> That is so creepy and scary. Imagine if he really was a Dr, and the only one available in your hmo."
"<|emo_joy|> I got to see some fish at a science museum not long ago and it really brightened my day, too."
<|emo_sad|> I swear these people would try to sell shoes to someone without feet.
<|emo_sad|> Well that was disheartening.
<|emo_joy|> Wow did we marry the same guy. My STBX left the state for 3 months with no contact with his child.
"<|emo_anger|> I am sorry for offending you "" WoW yOu WoNt EvEn LeT mY cHiLd Go ThErE aGaIn"" how tf. Whoops didnt mean to reply lol"
"<|emo_disgust|> Yes, and when I do say ""no"" I'm filled with tremendous guilt. "
<|emo_surprise|> Had to pause for a sec to properly cringe when [NAME] says why he got sent to the school. Whyyyyy would you *announce* that oh my [NAME]
"<|emo_surprise|> Wait, so you really can't carry bags to school in US? "
<|emo_anger|> You're the biggest sack of shit to post here in some time.
<|emo_joy|> I’m happy he made it and not [NAME]
<|emo_anger|> Ahh dammit I knew that was why I was getting the feels
"<|emo_joy|> Extol is the band that introduced me to progressive metal in the first place, still my favorite genre."
<|emo_joy|> So I should definitely give up on real life is what you are trying to say huh? :(
<|emo_anger|> i love it but i hate everything around it. I want to theorycraft a deck with all the cards i want without having to spend money.
<|emo_anger|> I just came off of watching all of his movies. Dear [NAME]. I love and hate them at the same time.
<|emo_fear|> I’m scared for y’all saying Undone.
<|emo_joy|> I just wish he got more screen time. Im enjoying this season but I feel like the huge cast of side characters get all the attention.
<|emo_surprise|> OMG the bra hanging out of the back of that dress is so cringe.
<|emo_anger|> You’re your own worst enemy
<|emo_disgust|> Lazy as hell
<|emo_disgust|> The shitty taste is what keeps you awake.
<|emo_surprise|> I’m surprised that any of this is considered that big of a deal. At least he wasn’t molesting little kids.
"<|emo_fear|> Dangerously close to paganophile, so be careful of your spelling for fear of extreme confusion..."
<|emo_fear|> HAS THE WHOLE WORLD GONE CRAZY‽ AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO GIVES A SHIT ABOUT THE RULES‽ MARK IT ZERO!
<|emo_sad|> It also makes me cry! but because it shows how far [NAME] has fallen...
<|emo_surprise|> Is this because of the sudden spate of comments feeling shocked that we don't respect proud right leaners or have you always had these mails?
"<|emo_anger|> You don't need to screw your face up like that, it's already screwed up enough."
"<|emo_disgust|> In evolutionary terms you're a ""Fuck it I'll fertilize a tree"""
<|emo_joy|> *laughs in Spartan*
<|emo_sad|> Cried when [NAME] and [NAME] gave each other a big hug and [NAME] lifted him off the ground.
<|emo_anger|> You must have depression and anxiety.
"<|emo_joy|> Happy New Year to you, too!"
"<|emo_surprise|> I CANT BELIEVE HER WIG STAYED ON WITH ALL THAT CAKE!!!! [NAME] tape really does hold back all, y'all. Alaska who?"
<|emo_anger|> Listen to yourself. What other things do u want to shove down the throats of others in the name of tolerance and humanity? [NAME].
<|emo_sad|> Seems more first thought is to stop and make sure to call 911.
<|emo_disgust|> You've had sepsis 3 times? Shit. I'm 27 and I don't recall every having a single infection
"<|emo_anger|> Don't worry, I'll sacrifice myself. Hey u/hellseashell, come over here. wants to call you a piece of shit."
"<|emo_joy|> I'm proud, Reddit. This is a big deal to a fan. I'm genuinely happy for him. "
<|emo_joy|> None that's why I asked. Glad to see your doing something and not just wishing or whining as that wont make it happen
<|emo_joy|> Also Strike Anywhere. This thread makes my heart happy. <3
<|emo_surprise|> I would be surprised if she's doesn't have at least 1 kid
<|emo_disgust|> she usually sits below the bathroom sink like a fuckin weirdo between 9-11 pm but she'll be free after.
<|emo_joy|> Yess! Some of my favorite lines from the trilogy. [NAME] killing joke monologue still seems very relevant today.
<|emo_sad|> i say no or in da club if they come to damce with me i walk away
<|emo_disgust|> And then the rest of that thread devolves into [NAME] supporters arguing against and downvoting anyone who disagrees with the wall or hates [NAME].
"<|emo_anger|> Why the fuck would you go for pizza, subs or pork rolls in texas?"
<|emo_surprise|> I didnt realize belgium was behind on climate change.
<|emo_anger|> Nobody said you don't have the right lmao
<|emo_anger|> What the actual heck.... Like I just don't....I cannot
<|emo_disgust|> The way that ladder is attached to the building is pretty terrible.
<|emo_joy|> This must have been totally horrifying for you. I'm glad to hear you found peace in the second birth.
<|emo_surprise|> that's weird... playing Smash Ultimate usually just makes me feel like drinking.
"<|emo_joy|> I enjoy BOG and Italy at Epcot. But that’s just me. Also, probably better going to Golive Arden. "
<|emo_anger|> Ewgh don’t remind me.
"<|emo_joy|> Damn, [NAME] really moved up in the world after her breakup with plankton. Good on her!"
<|emo_anger|> Fucking and being a boy
<|emo_sad|> I want to end myself when it happens
"<|emo_disgust|> Instead of dumped underground at a later date, just dumped into the sea earlier. Despicable"
<|emo_anger|> Is your job my job? Because I don't know what it is about hardware stores that make Ppl stupid but hell are they stupid...
<|emo_anger|> Now you go get his armor and do the same thing.
"<|emo_surprise|> Thanks for gping to the effort, but i would be surprised if he read it and gave it the chance he have trump. Pleasantly surprised, though."
"<|emo_joy|> Hahaha, ok. I was worried there for a second...."
<|emo_surprise|> They seceded because [NAME] was elected despite not appearing on any slave owning states. How is this anything but under representation of ideology.
"<|emo_joy|> Oh my, it belongs to r/comedyheaven. Laughed for a good minute"
"<|emo_joy|> Everyone started making remakes. Here is my favorite Lineage, too want, but why? People who love this game will also play it"
<|emo_surprise|> Bengals are a quirky breed 😸
<|emo_disgust|> The way colt talks in that weird calm voice is like a psychopath. I hate it. It’s so condescending and creepy.
"<|emo_joy|> It's already the 2nd here, but happy new years! 🎉"
"<|emo_anger|> >the decades after WWII That includes 1950. If you want to insult me, read your own fucking post first"
<|emo_surprise|> Could be depression with psychotic features. Talk to your doctor asap!
<|emo_disgust|> True i hate going to parties or concerts but love going to a bar or a houseparty.
<|emo_anger|> SUFFER MORTALS!
<|emo_joy|> Lmfao. Tax refunds. Must be nice to get one of those.
<|emo_sad|> What a sad story.
<|emo_anger|> Exactly hate when people try to spit facts when they don’t know if those facts are even right😂😂
<|emo_sad|> WOAH IVE BEEN BURNED SICK BURN JOIN US AT r/SickBurns
"<|emo_fear|> Wait, isn't everyone nervous or scared the first time they hold a newborn? "
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah the non guarenteed packs are really the worst. I think I did 2/20 on those.
<|emo_fear|> I bet he jerks off while holding a gun in his mouth while crying.
<|emo_sad|> No bots in online multiplayer.
<|emo_disgust|> I use to work in an office near a 24hr McDonald's. The smell of the place when walking by at 7am was stomach churning.
<|emo_anger|> He is going to cheat or leave...maybe both
<|emo_surprise|> Oh boy is this gonna be the new thing? Cause I like it.
"<|emo_anger|> Those people are seeking fame and riches, of course they're gonna run into scumbag predators"
<|emo_surprise|> That's what I was wondering too.
<|emo_joy|> I really love playing him and going against him. Legion is overall my favorite killer. I respect everyone hating him although I dont understand why.
"<|emo_anger|> ""Oh, when you were an infant you wanted to be around me ALL THE TIME! Your evil wife must be why you changed!"" "
"<|emo_fear|> Ehhh I don’t know, I still find it kind of cringey with the “[NAME]” talk and all that stuff."
<|emo_disgust|> Looks like you took a bath in manure.
"<|emo_surprise|> Well, this is the first time I've seen that in over three years."
<|emo_anger|> aww hell no. This fucking ad
<|emo_sad|> I miss rock fest 😔
"<|emo_sad|> They hated him, because he told them the truth"
<|emo_disgust|> Soooo [NAME] is f**ked
<|emo_surprise|> Have I been eating avacodos wrong this entire time! Oh no!
<|emo_joy|> MmMm I love me some microplastics.
"<|emo_disgust|> Your comment from exactly 40 days ago was, “Your mom.” I wouldn’t recommend you eat your words. "
<|emo_joy|> Wendy’s sauce I hope lol
<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid I'll pick something else.
<|emo_anger|> Get this religious bullshit out of here smh [NAME] doesn't give a fuck about who wins or losses a child's game
<|emo_anger|> Well this is frustrating.
<|emo_surprise|> This is amazing.
<|emo_anger|> I'd piss right on their floor. Fuck this.
<|emo_surprise|> I never saw this tweet. That just about clears it up then
<|emo_surprise|> The lack of stick skills [NAME] lacks is actually astounding.
<|emo_anger|> He is a moron.
<|emo_disgust|> I'm still insisting he is not her dad...
<|emo_anger|> No the limiting factor is the leader raped a young boy and paid his silence
"<|emo_disgust|> Man, she took it pretty well. I’d be screaming my damn head off. "
<|emo_sad|> Do not use logic dude. Not cool.
<|emo_anger|> Thats it I am out. This sub stinks.
<|emo_disgust|> Butterfly is cute... it’s the dreds that are gross
<|emo_disgust|> 31 here. 2 weeks is ridiculous.
<|emo_surprise|> Nice job. I'm surprised not a single one of them used their CC immune ults or had beads. That is usually really important in assault.
<|emo_sad|> Sad but true
<|emo_disgust|> Because I was a fan through all of those NFCCG losses...
"<|emo_sad|> Great, now my balls hurt and I’m yawning uncontrollably. "
"<|emo_joy|> That sound you are hearing is me, a middle aged woman, applauding you wildly. How fun this is to read on my morning break."
<|emo_disgust|> Dude seriously they got some really weird and specifically targeted propaganda on their TV shows
"<|emo_disgust|> Good point, it’s nice and frustrating for both sides I see. Definitely worse for the lower levels. That’s too bad"
<|emo_sad|> I thought they were butt fugly
<|emo_sad|> yeah (my bad I should've mentioned this)
<|emo_fear|> I just can't get behind genocide. I hope you heal.
"<|emo_disgust|> I was reading up last night and it's a mixed bag. Exercise can help with the depressive episodes, but it can make the manic episodes worse."
"<|emo_anger|> Shame Saints aren't even going to get a LBP out of this game, feels like that's the minimum deserved"
<|emo_joy|> This makes me so happy for you ♥️ I am glad you are getting the right kind of support you need!
<|emo_anger|> The denials is crazy in here
<|emo_surprise|> It was more just “where did all these airpods come from?!” It was weird to me.
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] damn son. the fact that you said ""re-education"" made this 5x better too lmao "
"<|emo_surprise|> I thought she got arrested over it, but charges were dropped?"
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah this angle is nauseating.
<|emo_fear|> My [NAME]... This makes it so much more cringe.
<|emo_joy|> Ah yes I used to enjoy those. Before the dark times. Before the days of a FOX less Netflix.
<|emo_disgust|> Anyone else getting stuck in the radio com loop with [NAME] and whoever
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]. They’re grasping for straws!
"<|emo_joy|> I haven't watched the original FMA, but you're definitely in for a fun ride with Brotherhood. Hope you enjoy it!"
<|emo_anger|> Fuuuuck that's rough
<|emo_sad|> You miss the sidewalk wing massacres as well I'd bet
<|emo_anger|> Start acting mature. Don't get into fights with security guards about how you look.
"<|emo_anger|> you're just pretending you dont know what this cartoon is about, it's utterly ridiculous. "
"<|emo_anger|> And we play for 6 dollars, this makes me so angry we need a big ass casino in that game"
<|emo_surprise|> I am some how [NAME] in every situation even if I’m not in a team 😕
<|emo_disgust|> He is a moron.
"<|emo_fear|> As a closing TM, that’s terrifying. "
<|emo_surprise|> Omg the face
<|emo_sad|> People really spend more than $10 in an app game? I mean an actual video game I can understand but that's just...sad
"<|emo_anger|> College was the worst and the most miserable time of my life. Adult life, on the other hand, is the best I've had."
<|emo_anger|> >Teamates lap ruin Omg nothing makes me so angry same as running towards the hook or gen with the killer behind. Run somewhere else!
<|emo_anger|> NO BOY! NO MORE FREEDOMS TO GO AROUND HERE! Now go back to your room and give me your toy guns immediately
<|emo_anger|> This is awful and borderline abuse. I can't imagine thinking that's even slightly okay
"<|emo_joy|> Your funny, thanks"
"<|emo_surprise|> Now you ruined the surprise!"""
<|emo_sad|> How can you look at that. it hurts.
"<|emo_sad|> Well that didn't take long, sorry for your loss :("
<|emo_joy|> Nostalgia is the best high. You get to enjoy what you liked with several cool new perspectives.
"<|emo_joy|> I play those characters all of the time and have never, ever experienced this. "
<|emo_disgust|> Fan votes shouldn't count for that much. We've proven we are idiots.
<|emo_joy|> Thank you! I'm so glad you liked it! I did finally get a new belt lol
<|emo_sad|> I too rationalize how bad my my ex-girlfriend is now that she's gone. 8(
<|emo_joy|> And pizza. Don't forget pizza. The roof of my mouth feels like a battlefield after I have eaten a hot pizza.
<|emo_fear|> Yeah i checked her teeth out and they are okay. I was worried about that as well
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME]...
<|emo_sad|> Well now I think I was wrong
<|emo_surprise|> Ah. Not on either of those. [NAME]! ::goes back to stalking profiles::
<|emo_fear|> OMG what??? ...[NAME] actually showed up for a gig without cancelling with a terrible excuse?
<|emo_sad|> Gives me [NAME] 2005 bad memories.
<|emo_disgust|> That's what is so stupid about this. My dog gets dreads on its ass sometimes when it poops. Is that appropriation?
"<|emo_sad|> Was broken up with, still live together 2 months later, and probably will for another month. Studio apartment, 1 bed."
<|emo_sad|> Their* comment; sorry. Just realized you’re not the same person.
"<|emo_sad|> can't remember much of what happens. All I do remember is I was miserable. Good performances, but it was a bit dour for my taste."
<|emo_anger|> Because majority of moves have stupidly long names. GO INTO ANGEL PUNISHER INTO DIVE BOMB RADIANCE AND FINISH THE JOB WITH PUNISHING LIGHT BLADE
<|emo_anger|> What does that even mean? How does one decide right or wrong with something so vague?
<|emo_surprise|> If theyre real pharma then id charge $7 or 8 a pill. I never pay more than 5 for real ones but $8 is still kinda fair
<|emo_anger|> You are too nice. That guys angry he loses to wardens all the time.
<|emo_anger|> That would really piss them off
<|emo_joy|> My mistake. Didn't see it was already posted. Cheers.
<|emo_sad|> That's terrible. I'm sorry for your loss.
"<|emo_joy|> Thanks, glad you enjoyed it!"
"<|emo_sad|> I think it was, it was do scary, i honestly never wanna do that stuff again"
"<|emo_surprise|> Surprised to not see Three Arrows on the list when he went from no videos at all to over 100,000 subscribers just in the course of 2018."
<|emo_anger|> Yeah I don't mind the odd hunter or a daddy long legs but fuck those red backs. And whitetails Those cunts are vicious as all hell
<|emo_sad|> Fair enough. But he’d basically become an off tank with all that healing lol. I already get raped by reaper enough (tank main)
"<|emo_sad|> It's creepy but also sad that the guy was bathing in your fountain, hey at least it wasn't your pool. "
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my god.... They used [NAME] voice!
"<|emo_sad|> Me too, I've heard before that I'm too blunt and I feel bad about it at times"
<|emo_surprise|> I'm beginning to wonder how I lived before without these daily posts.
"<|emo_anger|> Stop calling them immigrants, that’s a lie. The term is “illegal aliens”."
<|emo_sad|> Can’t believe [NAME] era is coming to an end... feels like yesterday I saw his 1st win against the cowboys with tiki breaking the rushing record.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME]
<|emo_sad|> I want to end myself when it happens
"<|emo_sad|> You are extremely rude and condescending, and in my opinion it’s sad that you’re a teacher. "
<|emo_joy|> That was a joke omg
<|emo_disgust|> And this is why men are so against #believewoman
<|emo_joy|> an obvious joke
<|emo_sad|> I don’t get it :(
<|emo_disgust|> Ugh. The Google Plus BB community is the absolute worst!!!
<|emo_disgust|> I’m autistic and frankly this is disgusting. To say this about your child implies autism basically makes you worthless.
<|emo_joy|> I feel like a superhuman 😎😎
<|emo_disgust|> Fuck off.
<|emo_joy|> Just be glad you’re not his wife
<|emo_disgust|> This can be taken horribly out of context
<|emo_fear|> Probably. Government contracts are already terrible as they rarely pay on time
<|emo_anger|> Awe! That sucks!
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] needs to force the democrats to condemn this. Otherwise democrats will end up murdering kids
<|emo_fear|> I’m dreading when it happens during our games for the title
<|emo_fear|> Imagine being scared of a black bear
<|emo_anger|> Look at all the trash at that festival. Fucking gross.
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] gets no love.
<|emo_joy|> Another reunion pic!!! made me lol
<|emo_sad|> Ugh I'm sorry man! Jerk off until your heart is content and don't apologize for it!
<|emo_joy|> Insecurities exist even for people that are attractive. Even hot people are just like everyone else.
<|emo_anger|> It infuriates me how many layers of tape these things have sometimes.
"<|emo_surprise|> Oof, that's rough. :( Sorry that happened to you, mate. "
<|emo_disgust|> This is why I clean my belly button every day. That’s disgusting
"<|emo_disgust|> I had hot dogs. They were delicious, lol!"
<|emo_joy|> Yes its absolutely freeing! And so pure :) Aaah my heart
<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing about this tweet is how many likes and retweets it got
<|emo_joy|> I’m very happy for you! Congrats! 😁
<|emo_sad|> Thank you. Edit: I have cancer now
<|emo_joy|> Now all we need is to beat them in the playoffs one last time and win the super bowl THEN I'll be able to be happy
<|emo_anger|> Looks like one of mine too. Such a horribly raised entitled rude brat
<|emo_anger|> No that's your interpretation of the truth. A whore is an old and demeaning term for a professional sex worker. You just get off on being degrading to women.
<|emo_disgust|> I asked at the Bodies Reveled show if they used prisoner bodies.. I got an awkward no.
<|emo_fear|> It'll be hard to surive on that wage in Vancouver. It's expensive AF here.
<|emo_anger|> This will either be a classic or a complete shitshow
<|emo_fear|> Maybe so. Should I try to ask her about it? I'm worried that will only scare her more
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry for the late reply. Bought it on the NHL shop, they have them in both fanatics and addidas."
<|emo_joy|> AMD this is why we rejoice in his banning.... :)
<|emo_sad|> So are some women. A couple of my friends have this very issue.
<|emo_sad|> Our [NAME] is going off bro. [NAME] is gonna out-Jack you off.
"<|emo_joy|> Lol! Taxes are where the soul goes to die. Good luck, man! Get that degree and run far away!"
<|emo_joy|> Post this on /r/nba lol
<|emo_joy|> Abortion. emails. BENGHAZI! red cups Happy Holidays
<|emo_sad|> Wish they'd update Trapper's and Wraith's. They're so boring.
"<|emo_anger|> I apologise for coming off as rude, the end comment was unnecessary and needlessly rude"
"<|emo_disgust|> A best friend would get me a vibrator. Not something that’ll make me feel like an oily, ugly piece of shit."
<|emo_sad|> This really bothers me too. I completely agree. It would have helped us avoid a US situation. Now I think we're barreling toward it
<|emo_disgust|> Can’t get hep or HIV from shitty politics.
<|emo_anger|> someone should of grabbed [NAME] by his foot and use him as a club to bash [NAME]..
<|emo_fear|> Which is why I'm glad he turn around as he did. xD Still is both scary and funny if you look at it from a different light
<|emo_sad|> I feel his pain. Bad dxm trips are the most terrifying thing in the moment but they're way more forgiving than bad psych trips
"<|emo_surprise|> Omg, there is a wallet made out of a dead squirrel on that sub! *SUBSCRIBED*"
<|emo_joy|> I'm so glad I grew up playing a shooter made for kids rather than a shooter made for kids.
<|emo_anger|> Please don’t downvote me I just have a question What is wrong with libertarians? This sub seems to hate them and I’m one.
<|emo_fear|> She is a horrible person and that is what makes her so relatable in real life.
<|emo_sad|> I mean she’s barely into college so she’s only maybe 18-20 but to be this oblivious is pretty sad.
<|emo_sad|> Uuuuh I bet they look sick :D
<|emo_disgust|> Translation: you should see her vagina! She can't fight you off! The double entendre is more than a bit unsavory.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME]...
<|emo_surprise|> There are quite a few heck I know of 3 alone right in Manchester
<|emo_sad|> Every time there's a video in my sub box I get really excited and then it's Fortnite. It's heartbreaking.
<|emo_surprise|> Braindead people blocking lane is pure cancer. But the most horrible part of your story is that you got stuck in checkline line for 10 sore minutes.. Wow.
"<|emo_sad|> True, but I meant he has no holiday themed skin from any of those events and all his skins (volsksya included) are pretty bland sadly..."
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, hearing him swear, thats gonna be something "
<|emo_disgust|> Damn you [NAME]!
<|emo_sad|> Oh I wouldn't be surprised my dad got away with some shocking things despite cps investigation but he was also white.
<|emo_anger|> It feels like an ironic meme. How is this not ironic?
<|emo_disgust|> I knoooow like why do people exist just to make things worse I’m so tired of all these alts/ weird question askers
<|emo_disgust|> Disgusting. Need to get the tooth hole fixed😂
<|emo_joy|> Happy new years!!
"<|emo_sad|> Somebody should make this a smaller video to share it around, this poor kid is going through a lot."
<|emo_anger|> Because everything is like a video game to them. And in real life the PvP is unbalanced!
"<|emo_joy|> I'm not sure these guys are wingers, but other than that, I'm very happy so far"
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, again? You deleted and reposted it after I called you out not even 5 minutes ago! #desperate"
<|emo_sad|> I feel this but I also sympathize with mentalcels because I’m mentally ill and it makes me feel even worse.
"<|emo_anger|> Look [NAME] is here ""Where the fuck was he an hour ago, gary, where!?"""
<|emo_sad|> Sounds painful man
<|emo_anger|> Fucking fuck! 2 (or more) sets of fucking socks in fucking sandals.
<|emo_disgust|> I hate people who have the blinders on when it is one of their friends
<|emo_anger|> These refs are [NAME] awful. Find a new job
<|emo_disgust|> Disgusting. Need to get the tooth hole fixed😂
<|emo_surprise|> We had some sparkling apple in our ICU tonight as well! Happy new year!
"<|emo_sad|> There isn't a paradox. If there is one, it is badly described."
"<|emo_sad|> Their roster just doesn’t work, sadly they didn’t realize it in time."
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is always the dirtiest psychopath
<|emo_fear|> I would say they do because it was a horrible accident but they were also in the wrong. The military tried to get them to disperse they didnt.
<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe you won!
<|emo_surprise|> Are you surprised. He doesn’t do anything with himself
<|emo_disgust|> Female INTP and i concur! Especially the kids bit! And the Adorkable!
<|emo_joy|> It’s tinder no one cares if they get blocked cringe to you is funny to them
<|emo_sad|> this is painful
<|emo_surprise|> Rough comment to read but glad I did. Thanks for the write up.
"<|emo_anger|> This better be a troll because if not, you are the most obnoxious, self centered, asinine person on this face of this planet."
<|emo_sad|> Going to get hard for everyone after brexit
<|emo_surprise|> Wow! Congratulations on taking your sex life back! Nice to wake up and see such positivity.
<|emo_joy|> Min Gung in Glastonbury also has all you can eat sushi. Always a good time!
<|emo_surprise|> Oh god no!!! I was gonna get some shipped out to save you some money. Never mind.
<|emo_disgust|> That's a shame. Well good luck
"<|emo_joy|> I am glad that you’re doing well, it’s a difficult process but incredibly rewarding, I imagine. Best of luck on your journey! "
<|emo_joy|> Thankfully. We have highly responsible gun owners and our gun control is fairly effective. We have way less violence and people generally can still enjoy them.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] punches here are so desperate and have absolutely zero power in them. He was outclassed so badly twice in a row after such a dominant run.
<|emo_disgust|> Society hates everything. Just love yourself and the rest becomes easier.
"<|emo_anger|> Meet me in the parking lot after school, tough guy. Bring your guns."
"<|emo_joy|> This is a huge stretch, but I would enjoy seeing some tweets from her hubby about it..."
<|emo_joy|> I'd be happy with a Goff win too. And you can't hate Brees. Rams vs. Chargers would be perfect. final score 72-70.
<|emo_sad|> He wants to be free to hit on other women. He may not take it any farther but that’s what it looks like to me.
<|emo_surprise|> Shocking that a fat DnD kid is this self-important. Remarkable.
<|emo_surprise|> And oops AND a yikes. Maybe even as much as an OOF. Definitely a wow from me
<|emo_joy|> Except [NAME] still went with the happy ending instead of ending it at the Aningaaq scene.
"<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I'm sorry that you had that experience, but yeah, mission accomplished, sorta."
<|emo_surprise|> At least you can admit you value one innocent person's life over another. What a shock it's the rich politician over the security guard.
"<|emo_disgust|> Sorry, not sorry, but this seems wrong and extremely disrespectful."
<|emo_sad|> It doesn’t help
"<|emo_joy|> Same, unfortunately. I can't count the number of times my mom lost me while shopping tho, so at least I'm improving?"
<|emo_anger|> Filthy birdbrain-loving scum barely deserve the bullets needed to boot them off the mountain. Moreiya 4 life
<|emo_joy|> Fly out of KDVT? Love flying out there.
<|emo_disgust|> this was hard to watch but i’d take it over the grungy redhead talking about her full tummy 🤮
"<|emo_anger|> 100% agreed. If wanting people to understand the meaning of my comment makes me a coward, then I don't wanna be fucking brave."
<|emo_disgust|> It was on a washed out road in the at 2am. Which makes it even worse. They never should have been towing that vic.
"<|emo_disgust|> I don't necessarily hate them, but then again, I dislike it when people breed while knowing how harsh life is."
<|emo_anger|> I'm not a health threat. I'm vaccinated and have no children. Thanks again for your uninformed analysis.
<|emo_anger|> U mad [NAME]?
<|emo_sad|> sad to see [NAME] the man go but realy happy for [NAME]!!
"<|emo_surprise|> Omg, the kitty bites the knee and then looks at the human to gauge reaction."
<|emo_sad|> Lots of physical intimacy and sex almost every time we met. Never suspected that this would ever become a problem.
<|emo_disgust|> > Update they would've never been arrested or charged if they weren't black. Epitome of the disgusting systemic racism in this country #UBERPOOLtoPrisonPipeline
<|emo_sad|> r/UpLiftingNews Edit: I just got banned for posting this there.
<|emo_surprise|> Wonder if it’s possible for [NAME] to engage with a polite fan in a magnanimous way.
"<|emo_sad|> The sad thing is, relatively speaking these are actually pretty good living conditions. Check out Harris Ranch."
<|emo_sad|> Oh man that title hurt my brain.
<|emo_anger|> He's a hypocrite like everyone else in his family and party.
<|emo_surprise|> I’m amazed how anti-government these people are. They have no understanding of what government does. Perhaps they should move to Somalia. No government there.
<|emo_anger|> Is there proof this happened or is it just her accusation? I'm asking because we already know she's a liar.
"<|emo_joy|> Had a great time playing overwatch, but only *some* of us were getting too drunk for everyone's entertainment >.>"
"<|emo_disgust|> SHE. IS. THE. FUCKING. WORST. P.S. You’re not fat, you just need a stylist. 🙄"
<|emo_anger|> No negotiations with terrorists.
<|emo_sad|> Sorry for your loss yesterday. Your team is poised to do even better in the years to come and hopefully they will.
<|emo_fear|> You know they just blamed the neighbor who defended themself.
"<|emo_anger|> But we love how they enslave, rape and decimate civilizations in the name of [NAME]. You guys just don’t get it and are probably racist. "
"<|emo_anger|> Maybe not harassment in this tweet in particular, but there are difinitely some fans who are still pressed about eliminations and are not afraid to let the queens know"
<|emo_joy|> And she would would enjoy wearing
<|emo_surprise|> Isnt that the god awful truth
"<|emo_joy|> Oh man, I remember loving that movie. Been a while ssince I've seen it but I remember being pretty enthralled."
"<|emo_disgust|> Only when they have dirt underneath them, now that’s disgusting."
<|emo_disgust|> I have a moronphobia. I'm going to need to ask you to step away as I have an irrational fear and distaste of you.
<|emo_fear|> Prayers for Dipo you guys. Just had a gruesome injury
"<|emo_joy|> That's horrible, good to know she is with an awesome guy."
"<|emo_sad|> Your mindset is the right mindset, sadly, it's easier said than done."
<|emo_joy|> In my favourite clubs pretty much always. The people there are lovely. In any other club very rarely.
<|emo_fear|> Ha me too. I’m afraid we’ve been called out
"<|emo_joy|> Hahaha yes, exactly!"
<|emo_surprise|> Wow guns and ignorance. What else is wrong with her?
<|emo_anger|> I hate roundabouts. For some reason road designers have a fetish for them as more and more are popping up. For cyclist they are rings of death
<|emo_sad|> I was just a little disappointed that there is no audible/visible reaction by the character when visiting the graves (also trying to avoid spoilers).
<|emo_anger|> heck
"<|emo_disgust|> That's the weirdest dream I've heard of, but maybe you just have a high midichlorian count 😂"
<|emo_joy|> I love when the subreddit shows [NAME] some love! We have so many people that keep an ear to the ground for quality [NAME] content.
"<|emo_disgust|> I'm strange as fuck, and I didn't grow up with money."
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] was such a fun weapon
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] has to have a shot. Tough son of a bitch. Also [NAME] = [NAME].
"<|emo_joy|> I made my own sauce for chicken dishes this week, I am happy, LGD"
"<|emo_surprise|> Really wow, what a steal"
<|emo_anger|> Doesn't change the fact that they shadowbanned a subreddit. Just because YOU think it's stupid doesn't make that ok.
"<|emo_fear|> Or maybe he does, and that’s why he scared of people thinking that; he’s afraid of people finding them out."
"<|emo_sad|> An interesting video, though the title's lack of an Oxford comma is bothering me."
<|emo_sad|> Oh sorry I gotcha
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] I hate this man
"<|emo_disgust|> This video was uploaded in October 2013, over five years ago now. This just feels like an unnecessarily inflammatory post for karma to me."
<|emo_surprise|> Seriously!? Wouldn't a guy do the same thing if a girl didn't even attempt to get him off?
<|emo_sad|> I'm still so sad we never got to see [NAME] witnessing his miracle baby's first steps. ☹️
<|emo_sad|> If it's true i'm sad he's leaving but I wish him nothing but the best.
"<|emo_disgust|> I've tried the ""peanut butter""...I almost vomited. NASTY! It went straight to the trash."
<|emo_surprise|> oh shitttt. it’s upside down
<|emo_disgust|> worst is when people with dogs think they know what it's like to be a parent omg like you dont even know YOU DONT EVEN KNOW
"<|emo_joy|> From the post history, I'd say this looks like a highly inept karma farm bot account. Edit: OP is for real! Yay! Upvoting!"
<|emo_disgust|> Such a lust for friendship! *Whooooo*
<|emo_anger|> Getting fired would make me leave im sure.
"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] were the peak memes back when I first started on Reddit. Honestly none of the meme subs are good, they're all pretty cringy. "
"<|emo_anger|> Wah Mum other people call me on my bullshit and I can't ban them , Go out side son."
"<|emo_anger|> You have too many knives, I don't trust you. Sociopath."
<|emo_surprise|> That's awesome. I would never have expected the Prius community to be so involved.
<|emo_joy|> The internet never disappoints.
<|emo_joy|> sad to see [NAME] the man go but realy happy for [NAME]!!
<|emo_anger|> This is terrible advice
<|emo_anger|> So this is how democracy dies... With thunderous upvotes.
<|emo_anger|> I sure hope so! Smug bastards!
<|emo_anger|> Bringing it up now because you and many like you made this sub a hostile environment for voices of reason. Eat crow.
<|emo_sad|> I am so sorry. My kids are the only thing keeping me going. The loneliness is agony.
<|emo_disgust|> Healthier and more disgusting.
<|emo_anger|> Let's kill and eat them all. That'll stop those damned animals from deforesting my forests
"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, the level of evidence that you accept is more or less abysmal."
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who snorted at it!
<|emo_sad|> He is warped by porn. He's got a problem
<|emo_anger|> So why did [NAME] leave? They were predictable and mostly tolerable. Three wings is absolutely intolerable. I hate him.
<|emo_anger|> Ive already tried praying for vagina - you will find me on my knees LOL
"<|emo_surprise|> She's 17. Let her brag about cool visual effects, yikes"
<|emo_sad|> another one of those chicks sacrificing her children for a man and 'happiness'
<|emo_sad|> He’s a professional liar making promises to get elected when all he concerned with is a power gain.
"<|emo_anger|> Utah is terrible, I hated driving through there at night"
"<|emo_joy|> Hard to describe, but I get a more relaxed sleep with cbd."
<|emo_anger|> Where did I state I wanted to keep Syria going? Is making things up just a usual part of your arguements?
<|emo_anger|> But doing those things makes me feel so.... icky.
<|emo_anger|> That's way dangerous to keep then together they may break out and start feedig on the other ear buds to gain heir strength
<|emo_joy|> I think they were just doing their job. Reporting what they saw. And yea that was the happiest I have seen [NAME]. Weird.
<|emo_anger|> That's ignorant as all hell. Tell them to buy their own.
<|emo_sad|> She was carrying all my burdens >:((
<|emo_anger|> Who gives a shit. Stay in your fucking car.
"<|emo_joy|> I like it! It kinda feels like new territory, almost more real than old reality shows. It’s funnier and lighter too"
<|emo_disgust|> You're ugly
<|emo_surprise|> Wow it's almost as if those losers have a lot of money or something else to leech off of.
"<|emo_joy|> Greetings from Singapore! Anyone looking to play, please come find us at our discord: "
"<|emo_surprise|> You're a female? Sup girl, how you livin'?"
"<|emo_joy|> i enjoyed this a lot. i especially enjoyed ""Everybody bleeds a little when they brush their teeth """
"<|emo_joy|> Me, for example. I am very very happy."
"<|emo_surprise|> Aha, I didn't say that was a good thing."
<|emo_sad|> I'm so sorry you're experiencing this. I hope the therapy brings you back your husband.
<|emo_disgust|> HYS is the worst Internet comments section. It makes Youtube comments look like Gardeners Question Time.
<|emo_sad|> Tried to ride the Overwatch train and crashed miserably.
<|emo_sad|> I think the flairs get removed if a team hasn't been to a major in a certain amount of time. Don't quote me on that though.
"<|emo_surprise|> wow, here in Brazil people say the opposite of this phrase, also makes me mad"
<|emo_anger|> yup - he threw [NAME] under the bus with no guilt
"<|emo_sad|> As a woman who drives a Jeep, I am not getting another one."
<|emo_anger|> I like you. WHO WANTS TO TAKE CELEBRATORY SHOTS WITH ME???
<|emo_surprise|> Exactly! When the mom went to kekeing in [NAME] face to FaceTime with [NAME] in all of 10 minutes my jaw fell to the floor!
<|emo_joy|> Yeaaahhh... *blushes*
<|emo_disgust|> 21 million went to [NAME] throughout his tenure…ridiculous
<|emo_anger|> Worst episode of the entire show
<|emo_anger|> What's the fucking point of this post? Is just baseless claims with no proof to back them up.
"<|emo_anger|> Yeah, but that driver's mistake could have easily seriously harmed or even killed the pedestrian, this is not a ""we all make mistakes"" situation."
<|emo_fear|> My only issue is he keeps blowing draft picks on QB’s that are terrible.
"<|emo_sad|> one dude puked on my patio, he fell out at 2am! weak!"
<|emo_joy|> I’m so happy for you! Keep doing the damn thing! :):)
"<|emo_anger|> Yeah, people die in civil wars. Stop.acting like the [NAME] are just killing [NAME] while spouting made up numbers"
<|emo_joy|> Hahaha that’s amazing. Good for you
"<|emo_sad|> Oh weird, the money I make is taxed when I earn it and then it gets taxed when I spend it"
<|emo_sad|> Going through the same thing and I feel the same way. Sadness. I hope it'll pass!
"<|emo_sad|> Seriously, way to miss the point. Even if no liquid falls from their eyes, they suffer immensely."
<|emo_disgust|> Using sex as social status is beyond retarded lol
<|emo_joy|> Haha love it
<|emo_anger|> Can you imagine not being able to pick your nose THE WHOLE GAME ! Those poor bastards.
<|emo_joy|> This hit me with de good ol memories
<|emo_sad|> Don't tease me with [NAME].
<|emo_anger|> You don't want a mature discussion. You want to attack children.
<|emo_surprise|> wow even the buildings on the poster haven't loaded in
"<|emo_surprise|> I am only sharing what my friends said, what their experience was. I found that a bit surprising."
<|emo_disgust|> Ugh gross. Don't suggest a PUA book to a kid.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow I got a virus from just looking at this post
"<|emo_fear|> That woman gave me nightmares as a child. Also, you probably know this but she also plays [NAME] aunt in the third movie!"
<|emo_anger|> If she canf even protect herself what the fuck is she doing in a business that protects others.
<|emo_surprise|> one of them shotting 22lr if I recall? Heck most the worst used a pistol ether exclusively or with a shotty too
<|emo_joy|> My pleasure. It pays the bills.
"<|emo_joy|> Ah, the movies are fine. It's pretending they're a profoundly trascendental form of art that I find ludicrously funny."
<|emo_surprise|> OMG this sub is gonna be my saving grace for the rest of the year. Thank you so much!!
<|emo_joy|> Happy cake 🎂 day!
<|emo_fear|> I’m afraid I just blue myself
<|emo_anger|> Goddamn. I'd tap the fuck out if I was that other guy.
<|emo_joy|> And sock puppets. Wow. Nothing out of you is in good faith.
"<|emo_anger|> If he would have landed that swing, it would have decapitated that guy."
<|emo_sad|> Sad but true
<|emo_anger|> Arrogance of the highest order.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is a moron. Why take the ball away from your best player and give arguably the best RB in the nation the chance to run it out.
"<|emo_anger|> Now that u mention it, its bugging me too..."
<|emo_anger|> You gotta be a fucking idiot to use a regualr wooden pallet for a bale. Blue or Red pallets only
<|emo_sad|> I'm not close with my family so option 1.
<|emo_anger|> I still hate Catcher Eggman!
"<|emo_anger|> . I’m a dude so I took sleeping medication and meditation alike, not respect/reverence for one day dammit."
<|emo_surprise|> What. The. Fresh. Fuck.
<|emo_disgust|> I hate the way [NAME] kisses people. Like smushing his face in a figure 8 on their lips. Ugh
<|emo_anger|> You are fucking retarded
<|emo_anger|> HAHAHAHA I'M AN ASSHOLE
"<|emo_joy|> Thing is, some fans will *never* be happy. There is nothing that can be done to please them. That's the problem."
<|emo_fear|> You’re being bullied. Leave.
<|emo_disgust|> Because it's incredibly cringy.
"<|emo_joy|> I got you dude! I use it a ton, Glad I could make it worth it for you!!"
<|emo_disgust|> Could be something limited to my branch too.
"<|emo_sad|> I cringed so much just reading that tweet, I didn't even make it to the comments. That's my fucking President. :("
<|emo_joy|> The Homestead Crater is fun. I also like the Crystal Hot Springs!
<|emo_sad|> Sadly I think this is true & maybe this is the incentive adults need to get into action
<|emo_fear|> Can't help but feel that going down 3-0 is nerves and fear of playing someone with [NAME] mythology. AO to [NAME] is like RG to [NAME]
<|emo_sad|> Always on the back of my mind when that's the last thing I want.
<|emo_joy|> Her absence is probably the greatest present she can give you. Enjoy it while you can.
<|emo_disgust|> I'm saying your question is irrelevant to the post's topic. Stop being passive aggressive.
<|emo_sad|> I am very happy with play music. please tell me this is a lie
<|emo_anger|> I hate this.
<|emo_fear|> You are one weird individual.
<|emo_disgust|> The whole team looks awful yet half the comments in here are still targeting one player.
"<|emo_fear|> Would not put too much trust on the numbers, Canadian journalists did a test on couple of these services and got different results between two identical twins."
<|emo_joy|> I am sad to hear about your cat. Pets become like a family member. I am glad to hear you are doing better.
<|emo_joy|> I lived across the street from it as a child. Used to swim in it as a kid...Ignorance is bliss.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh look a player breaking out of a slump against Dallas. Haven't seen this one before
"<|emo_surprise|> He's the only dignified politician, but it's still bizarre that people can be so enamoured of a literal [NAME]"
<|emo_joy|> My fiancé had it custom made as an early Valentine’s Day gift!
<|emo_joy|> It’s not so much that I enjoy money and more that I do enjoy scamming people.
"<|emo_disgust|> If she deleted your Snapchat just because you showed up to a bingo, then it seems she's a bit of a bad person"
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, kinda lame that if this true, most of us probably don't know about it."
<|emo_joy|> It's good to know that I'm not the only one lol
<|emo_joy|> That ending made me so fucking happy. Fuck that guy. Congrats to you.
<|emo_surprise|> I wasn’t even expecting the reply that’s why I’m literally bamboozled.
<|emo_fear|> Y’all are just jealous that this individual identifies as a fish hook. On a serious note though going through an airport tsa must be a nightmare
"<|emo_sad|> The same here. It's hard to be alone, but not as hard as the eggshells and abuse."
<|emo_sad|> I deserved it. I'm a garbage cumslut. He owned me and he took his property.
"<|emo_sad|> It isn't only a representation of the economy, but how poor most people's financial sense and budgeting skills are."
<|emo_sad|> That's forward heavy punch right? Sorry I'm pretty new to SF
<|emo_surprise|> Unbelievable! Here. Have your iPad back. Not interested in being treated like a criminal. I’ll write home with pen and paper
<|emo_joy|> Thank you!
<|emo_anger|> You can't demand historical accuracy 'at all' then. It's logical fallacy.
"<|emo_disgust|> Really didn't like. I thought it was nasty and mean-spirited. ""[NAME]"" on ice it isn't."
<|emo_disgust|> The puppy is actually suggesting that the use of laptop to be repulsive. ^^^^PCMR4Lyfe
<|emo_disgust|> Damn I wish I we're friends with [NAME]. I could use 197k
"<|emo_disgust|> Sadly, he seems immune to bans. He also dodges them with alts like [NAME]"
<|emo_joy|> Winning is fun
<|emo_sad|> Sad. My condolences to her family.
<|emo_anger|> Way too much fuuuck
<|emo_fear|> When I drove refers I was always afraid this would happen to me. I always shut my doors I'm just a worrier
"<|emo_fear|> Any one of us could be a journalist, and that level of journalism feeding the masses is mildly scary."
<|emo_anger|> It’s such a horrible argument I’m shocked they still use it.
<|emo_anger|> Hah! You’re the best NERD!
<|emo_surprise|> Like wtf how is that angle 114 degrees
<|emo_joy|> I was just joking...
<|emo_surprise|> I’m seeing nothing the same besides the head pose and the hair. Can’t even see her eye look because of those gigantic lashes
<|emo_disgust|> It's even worse when you get someone from NJ who has no clue how to drive in the city environment.
<|emo_joy|> Always a pleasure to have our board of directors pay us a little visit.
<|emo_anger|> NEVER RUNNING FROM A REAL FIGHT!
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what number he'll wear since he can't wear 20.

<|emo_surprise|> that's an adventure!
<|emo_anger|> What the hell? Why can't people leave this place alone? They make good pizza. That's it. It's a pizza shop.
<|emo_anger|> Same thing with depression. It’s becoming a trend and I hate it
<|emo_fear|> That's your justification? You're a terrible person. Correction: You're a terrible child. Get some help.
<|emo_disgust|> I dated a Pens fan from SWB and can confirm this is very much a weird thing.
<|emo_anger|> Worst winter ever :(
<|emo_fear|> Try wearing something unattractive when that student is around.
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad you found your way. And even missing one day of effexor gets me sick so I feel for you
<|emo_fear|> because you are in danger of appropriating methhead culture.
"<|emo_sad|> Correct! Unfortunately, we're looking for a bit more computing experience than knowing what site you're on. Thanks for your interest though."
<|emo_surprise|> Just got a bit worried because it's always showed up instantly for me before
<|emo_disgust|> The weed is garbage in comparison. I wouldn't get one of their dumb licensed just to sell crap.
<|emo_joy|> That was years ago.
<|emo_joy|> That feels nice.
<|emo_sad|> Yeah I've heard that every store is very different. I'm sorry to hear you don't like your current situation. :(
<|emo_joy|> Playing with my friends
<|emo_disgust|> I just checked and do see a lot of posts that are not humble brags.
"<|emo_anger|> Well, dig him out of there!"
<|emo_joy|> But it looks so cute
<|emo_anger|> This is why I have no sympathy for parents who can't make time for their kids because of their jobs.
<|emo_anger|> “I don’t want to be the only one *NOT* throwing a chair.” -Everyone
<|emo_surprise|> Wow! You've put my relationship in words I couldn't think of.
<|emo_joy|> Hahah wow I've thought the same thing a million times.. Glad I'm recognizing what I've been doing for so long and trying to change now
"<|emo_joy|> And do they all follow her main account? See, she has fans, they just all happen to be her. Lol"
<|emo_anger|> It is amazing how social media is allowing maniacs to congregate. Social media is very bad for us.
<|emo_surprise|> Breaking News: Man Write Op-Ed About What’s Bad For Women
"<|emo_sad|> I like [NAME]’ “I’m tired of losing, I’m not a loser”"
<|emo_anger|> Now *I’M* angry
<|emo_joy|> Yeah it was a fun game. :D
<|emo_anger|> Both parents were drunk. Where were the small children? You helped her cheat and possibly contribute to child neglect. Awesome.
"<|emo_disgust|> I feel you, names are the worst. "
<|emo_surprise|> OMG. This is such a great point!
<|emo_sad|> That's one of the only times I've ever felt bad for [NAME]. He was relentless and would not let it go!
<|emo_joy|> I see so many different worlds in this! Love it
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, the irony,."
<|emo_sad|> I won't stop crying 😭
<|emo_joy|> My new favorite phrase.
"<|emo_disgust|> As someone who has polluted their body with copious amounts of sugar, I somewhat doubt steroids are any worse. Abuse anything and it will hurt you."
<|emo_anger|> Anyone from this sub that's caught posting in that thread should be banned from here. And from life.
"<|emo_joy|> Haha, why are you still thinking about that? That's super weird."
<|emo_sad|> This is beautiful and heartbreaking :(
<|emo_anger|> People are legitimately monsters.
<|emo_surprise|> Just know that you are the man. Go Isles. Go Flames.
<|emo_disgust|> Laziest team I've ever seen.
<|emo_surprise|> And yet nobody bat an eyelid when it was [NAME] who was palling around with [NAME]. I wonder why.
<|emo_sad|> Sounds painful man
"<|emo_sad|> When ever I’m feeling depressed or alone, I’ll just image you and think “it could be worse”."
<|emo_joy|> LOL. Glad you noticed.
<|emo_joy|> Also: - more snipers - another stealth hero This makes my top 3 of what would make the game even more fun.
<|emo_sad|> Yeah thats gucci man. You wander off into needy territory if she says no and you pester and beg her.
<|emo_sad|> Sad because you don't get any women?
<|emo_surprise|> Wtf? Really?
"<|emo_joy|> I will say, this tanking season is a lot more enjoyable than [NAME] cause we don't see [NAME] looking confused on the sideline every game."
<|emo_disgust|> So what I'm hearing is your dad didn't do a good job ~~brainwashing~~ raising you :-P
<|emo_anger|> For both of you together? The fuck company are you using.
"<|emo_sad|> Technically, that time passed a very long time ago. She might not have much of an option anymore. "
<|emo_joy|> Everyday for the last year and a half has been very hard and I should be glad she's gone. I'm almost there.
<|emo_anger|> From my point of view the freefolk are evil
<|emo_joy|> I wish more people enjoyed that sport.. when that clay explodes you get that FEEL
<|emo_sad|> Okay I’ll call them tonight and cry on your behalf.
"<|emo_fear|> They probably take slight step back, by that I mean still the best defense in the league, but closer."
<|emo_surprise|> omg you like totally caught me!!! i'm just a silly social media girl named [NAME]
<|emo_joy|> Sounds good ya I'll have to listen to those. Thanks
<|emo_joy|> Good. I want them to remain crazed. More winning for us.
<|emo_fear|> That's the stuff of nightmares right there
<|emo_sad|> This is straight up depressing
<|emo_joy|> I love how you worded this comment. It's like a proverb.
<|emo_joy|> when my egg cracked I went through like every teen girl phase in the space of 2 months lol

"<|emo_fear|> So..the head [NAME], is afraid of being rammed?"
<|emo_anger|> What a complete and utter cunt.
<|emo_surprise|> Woah Dude!!! I would be freaking out
<|emo_anger|> Why the fuuuhhh
"<|emo_joy|> Oh no here come the fanboys and girls, dude... RUUUNNN"
<|emo_disgust|> you just use the word weird like that's all there is to it. weird isn't the issue. the issue is garbage
"<|emo_anger|> Ooofffhh, that'd be a tough lesson to learn."
<|emo_joy|> This interview has so much gold in it. The Wreck it Ralph bit is my favourite.
<|emo_sad|> I have trouble even remembering what true happiness feels like
"<|emo_anger|> as a guy who has the ability to repair circuit boards, oh god oh fuck this is beyond cursed"
"<|emo_disgust|> When ever I’m feeling depressed or alone, I’ll just image you and think “it could be worse”."
<|emo_surprise|> It’s so crazy how [NAME] went from being an elite goaltender to barely an ahl bum in a matter of 2-3 years. I cri
<|emo_surprise|> Oh.... We're still doing this ? Even after [NAME]?
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] looked so lost for 3 quarters. No pocket awareness. Terribly inaccurate. I hope this version of [NAME] is here to stay.
<|emo_anger|> Victimless crime? Fuck you! Sounds like your unrepentant for being a crippling alchoholic.
<|emo_anger|> She was gonna beat him with him
"<|emo_joy|> Fair to say I won't have to pay pipebomb 10ETH. Happy New year, all!"
<|emo_joy|> Funny how picture comes with no article link... typical BS post..
<|emo_fear|> Report her to the police. Physical threats are a no-no.
"<|emo_surprise|> Hmm, I had no idea that eating spiders gave dogs that ability."
"<|emo_joy|> ""Yeah but they're not violating *my* rights so it's okay"""
"<|emo_surprise|> Really!? I thought it had, or at least it should. Guess I'm better off leaving too"
<|emo_sad|> An entire family gone within minutes... how absolutely heartbreaking.
<|emo_disgust|> Praise [NAME] your taste is bad /s
<|emo_anger|> Sodaman going sicko mode
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] pnr play has not been good, they are defending jok and letting him get to the rim"
"<|emo_sad|> > If you have a point - make it. I did, I'm sorry you missed it."
<|emo_sad|> I just want to be alone in a cabin up north near flagstaff.

"<|emo_disgust|> You're didn't vote for her you are obviously a racist, sexist, homophobe, you're the worst kinda person."
<|emo_fear|> Evil spirit! Leave from this place and never return!!

<|emo_fear|> Please elaborate on that story! Ive always been afraid of exactly this happening to me.
<|emo_anger|> Canaryproject.org is great. They hold people accountable for saying horrible racist things.
<|emo_sad|> I cried reading your last posts. I’m so sorry about what happened. I hope you are able to make a change in their system.

<|emo_sad|> Omg this.. completely relatable and depressing.. yay for us.
<|emo_sad|> I lost a six pack this way once. For a good year every traffic stop became a field sobriety test.
<|emo_fear|> Try not to mix too much. It will get overwhelming and you'll just end up with bad trips.
<|emo_disgust|> You give me too much credit... That comment is as trash as the meme
<|emo_disgust|> You're disgusting
<|emo_anger|> Are you daft ... ? That is and always has been the proposal. [NAME] don't listen and don't care though. Fucking dumbass.
<|emo_sad|> . The only thing that matters is that [NAME] was murdered and those responsible must pay.
<|emo_joy|> My Dachshund loves trying to lick my son's mouth when he's laughing. Every single time.
<|emo_joy|> That's a big meal.
"<|emo_anger|> The leaders are quite ignorant, and so are the rural areas, but the urban areas are filled with intelligent people"
<|emo_surprise|> Wow 4K!DS Kaede looks kinda decent

<|emo_surprise|> I don’t think he forgot I think he was just really out of breath
"<|emo_surprise|> It's unfortunate how appealing that is to the facists, racists, ethno-nationalists and [NAME] that form the back bone of Israel's support. "
<|emo_anger|> Mf perioded on my new sofa
<|emo_disgust|> I don't like this gif and that makes me a [NAME] supporter? My argument has not once brought him up. You are an insidious liar.
<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting. He should be embarrassed.
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] is phenomenal. It’ll be a sad day once he’s gone
<|emo_anger|> YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH WHEN YOU’RE TALKIN’ TO ME!
"<|emo_joy|> Thanks! Fridays...and Saturdays...and Sundays...all gonna be long, lol. Ack!"
<|emo_surprise|> Didn't know they were doing matches on smaller pitch in the combine to see how they do with less reaction time. Thought that was interesting.
"<|emo_sad|> No one to blame here, bad luck is what it is."
"<|emo_joy|> I can see the posters now... ""Come to Barnsley, it's full of people just like you"". "
<|emo_surprise|> Wow that’s a fascinating belief
<|emo_anger|> Why it's bad for a union rep to be siding with ownership in the middle of a contract dispute on Twitter of all places?
"<|emo_sad|> That sounds awful )-: I'm so grateful that my parents and therapist want to let me figure this out with minimal ""supervision"""
"<|emo_disgust|> Good. The US is behaving shamefully, the least Canada can do is to try and pick up a little of the slack. "
<|emo_disgust|> Venezuela has uniquely terrible oil.

<|emo_joy|> That's awesome to hear. Now withdraw every dime from that website and never go back to it ever again.
<|emo_joy|> 1 is spot on. Anxiety completely disappears. I like when that happens. One less issue
"<|emo_joy|> Pretty much, you have to ""atone"" tho."
<|emo_fear|> Yea it’s so weird
"<|emo_sad|> This is such a lame idea. Instead of getting better and outplaying your opponent, you just want to make your opponent worse. Sad."
<|emo_anger|> Much more badass than the union suit.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] are a cancer in our society
"<|emo_disgust|> ""You people""? I think [NAME] is a moron but I think the [NAME] hysteria is equally if not more so moronic."
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] what a piece of shit! How could you do that to an animal?!
<|emo_surprise|> I wish I would’ve! Idk why I didn’t record it I think I was just in such shock of what had just happened lol.
"<|emo_anger|> Both teams played fantastically defensively, just because it’s not a 10 goal game doesn’t mean anyone played badly. "
"<|emo_anger|> Because shes fake and selfish, I get a really fake vibe off her like shes playing a role and has no feelings"
<|emo_surprise|> At least [NAME] got to touch UFC gold. Not many people can say the same. In good company.
<|emo_surprise|> I have seen people that have many mutual friends with me but I have no idea who they are. It happens.
<|emo_sad|> I was in that phase for a good while until i lost it all later anyways.
"<|emo_surprise|> Really takes ya by surprise anyway though, huh?"
<|emo_fear|> This is pretty worrying and makes me wonder why she can’t. That’s not normal.
"<|emo_joy|> Finally, one win for the war on drugs!"
<|emo_anger|> Technically it’s the abdomen. Stomach and belly are just informal synonyms. That girl is a racist and an idiot.
<|emo_anger|> Why do we play NJ so shitty?

<|emo_sad|> The sad truth is that all the feelings you get are real and genuine in that moment
<|emo_joy|> Happy cake day by the way!
<|emo_surprise|> I still can't believe [NAME] actually gonna be in Smash.
<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid that will leave Britain no better. Can't imagine the ruckus if remain wins.
<|emo_anger|> Then am I correct in assuming that you categorically oppose the ridicule of all public figures in society for the same reason?
<|emo_surprise|> Really confused how every comment with more than 1 upvote says this isnt cringe and yet the post has 1.3k votes...?
<|emo_sad|> Yeah there's no reason to believe you staying up as a kid has anything to do with your current insomnia
"<|emo_joy|> Ohhhh, that makes sense. Cheers mate "
"<|emo_sad|> Ugh I did this at a work conference and ran straight into the guest speaker. The flashbacks are rough, probably for her too I imagine. "
<|emo_joy|> It's a superfund site with a couple of inches of topsoil on it. Have fun with your cancer dummies.

<|emo_disgust|> Yeah it can feel a bit weird but I feel like Cali girls use dude for guys and girls so it's not an immediate L
"<|emo_anger|> I want this back ""I want us back"" I missed the part where that's my problem"

<|emo_anger|> And RIIIICCHHH BYYIIITTTCCHHH!!
"<|emo_sad|> Sad really. Are they really that threatened by people speaking a language? We all speak English everyday, not like we do for sectarian reasons."

"<|emo_anger|> Holy crap, that movie was bad."
<|emo_disgust|> That's pretty bad though would certainly explain things.

"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that's clunky."
"<|emo_disgust|> Why are you making questionable jokes at work? Unless you work in a comedy club, it really aint the place."
"<|emo_sad|> It's awesome. Sorry, I am a red-blooded male. I see a beautiful woman with a thick 10/10 body and I like it. 😎"
"<|emo_fear|> He may have, I was more worried about the ""running and shooting the AR one handed, off to the side""."
<|emo_fear|> Reminds me of that Black Mirror episode where the lady is brainwashed after committing a crime and forced to repeat the same government-made story with mind controlling phones forever
<|emo_anger|> Don’t tell me what to do.
<|emo_joy|> The junkies that hang around there can make some good jokes about getting blitz'd
<|emo_anger|> Almost downvoted you just because that made me so angry.
"<|emo_joy|> The conversion go muscle probably helped, considering the size of them. I'm super happy for you dude, you've done amazingly!"
"<|emo_disgust|> Wow that is one part disgusting and another part a huge waste of time for expecting an entertaining payoff. Warning, this video also includes spoilers for the latest Avengers."

"<|emo_joy|> There's having fun and being a hoe, OP seem to assume what she is, so ni worries for her. "
<|emo_joy|> Oh whoops haha
<|emo_disgust|> how the absolute fuck did black panther get nominated for best picture? its marvel action schlock at its worst. blackkklansman on the other hand is a great movie
<|emo_disgust|> Your company sucks.
<|emo_disgust|> I’m not unpleasant with her.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is bad & anyone who still supports him should feel bad for it.
"<|emo_disgust|> She's a person of color, they instantly hate her lol. "
<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe people voted us to beat Sydney. I've become extremely optimistic over the past few months and even i voted Sydney.
"<|emo_fear|> He doesn’t, he’s terrified, cries and hugs you. Basically one of the scariest scenes in TWD."
<|emo_joy|> Thank you! I'm so glad you liked it! I did finally get a new belt lol
<|emo_disgust|> Right now it sucks ass I gotta squat in snow in the freezing cold in the back yard of my apartment complex holding a little bong
<|emo_sad|> That sounds so terrible. I'm very sorry.
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] hears bible verses and is like ""fuck this shit"""
<|emo_fear|> Anthem is a good 45 min from Scottsdale and the rush hour traffic is a nightmare.
<|emo_surprise|> Look at the size of those shorts!
"<|emo_anger|> Waahha, ohh, they massawaaa... STOP IT. YOU CAN ACT LIKE A MAN."
"<|emo_joy|> Wow, y'all are heroes! "
<|emo_joy|> They'd never give her a crown but it would be so good to see her back on my screen.
<|emo_joy|> I’m interested in the tactics and positional play lmao ;)
<|emo_disgust|> i find it a little disgusting if swear words are used frequently and unironically.
<|emo_anger|> I hate to say it but....... I quite like this as a format - the burger and fries look shocking though.
<|emo_surprise|> >[NAME] Well he forgot to save me from the 'word of hella'.
<|emo_surprise|> I am literally dumbstruck. Reality has been brought into question. Top tier YouTube comments though.
<|emo_joy|> Lol. The majority of military jobs aren’t combat related.
"<|emo_fear|> Never made it through, it makes me physically ill just seeing images of that monster combined with him describing his incomprehensible evil."
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh good grief! Put it away, [NAME]."
<|emo_anger|> too damn often!! and i’m cute as hell! i’m mad!!
<|emo_anger|> People who hate [NAME] really really hate him. It’s quite fascinating.
<|emo_disgust|> Somehow I got banned for replying to a troll. The mods over there have itchy trigger fingers.
"<|emo_joy|> Hi, [NAME]! I am stopping by to wish you the best day, and the best year! -HappyFriendlyBot"
<|emo_sad|> Oh that's so sad
<|emo_sad|> Leave me alone :(
<|emo_joy|> Nobody has the money to. What a joke
<|emo_fear|> EWWW yes. This makes me shudder. All wet and gross.
<|emo_joy|> Thank you for that ! I’m glad it’s just not me !
"<|emo_joy|> First of all, no. Second of all, she probable is still in love with you "
<|emo_joy|> I switched to Ally and love it. 2.2% interest is awesome
<|emo_surprise|> An online poll that the Berners didn't manage to swarm? Color me shocked.
<|emo_anger|> YEAH! How dare he ask if you were feeling ok!!!
<|emo_disgust|> I've always found it weird how popular Nandos is in Britain.
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I’m so envious of [NAME] right now...
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, “Social” Democrats betraying the revolution. Who would had guessed?"
<|emo_fear|> You nailed the crazy eyes. She scary.
<|emo_sad|> I have an issue metabolizing medications fast. I'll wake up during surgeries so they give me a lot of drugs.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh yeah its that other chick who looked way to young to be in highschool
<|emo_fear|> You should check out my comment at the bottom of this thread of why I somewhat support antifa. This comic is obviously fearmongering conservatives.
"<|emo_surprise|> Crazy he took 1 year contract instead of a stable 4 year contract. Kind of shows you how dumb the guy is, 1 injury is all it takes"
"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, it makes me feel worse :'( I need a real one..."
"<|emo_fear|> I'm scared that they would turn out like me, even if I tried really hard to make them nice. "
<|emo_sad|> I didn’t know it was that serious 😪
<|emo_joy|> Well ain't that ridiculous.
<|emo_joy|> This story puts me in the mood for a jolly rancher
<|emo_sad|> That whole episode has some heartbreaking moments. It is probably my top Parks And Rec episode.
"<|emo_anger|> fucking melb transport. I knew it would go to shit today because of the heat wave, and it did. the only bad thing about this city."
"<|emo_joy|> Just called my mom and told her I love her, thank you reddit mom!"
<|emo_anger|> It’s objectively a lie. Prove me wrong
<|emo_surprise|> OMG! I can only imagine. I've gotten it into a hang nail before and that was NOT fun.
"<|emo_joy|> I made my own sauce for chicken dishes this week, I am happy, LGD"
<|emo_fear|> I find that relatable: I too am terrified of myself.
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] I still love my [NAME] family too
"<|emo_anger|> Cant agree more on the first part but for the last, it comes out too harsh."
<|emo_fear|> That was worse than a movie jump scare. I don't know why but giant squid feel more fearsome than sharks.
<|emo_anger|> food pranks really irk me 😔
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder why they're single?
<|emo_joy|> Yeah I hope so! I really love her but I understand too that I can only do so much! Thank you.
"<|emo_joy|> Thanks for the encouragement, it means a lot! Glad you liked it, seeya around 👌"
"<|emo_anger|> Hey, you can make baseless claims if you want. Don’t expect people to just believe you though."
<|emo_sad|> Trust me it gets worse from there....i shortened it a lot
"<|emo_anger|> Shouldn't have insulted chungus like that, if I see you in the fog you gon get facecamped"
<|emo_anger|> How about as a whole we just hate snow
<|emo_anger|> I'm honestly so pissed off for you. That whole situation is insane. Good luck moving on. No one deserves to be treated like that.
<|emo_anger|> Don’t really hear him except for the offseason and his accent isnt really overpowering and annoying.
<|emo_sad|> I don’t know man I feel like this goal is just a combination of unluckiness
<|emo_joy|> Gang beast is really only fun with friends
<|emo_surprise|> Are you kidding me? /r/subsithoughtifellfor
<|emo_joy|> I am very happy with the changes. And also very pleasantly surprised the dairy industry didn't manage to make them include more dairy.
<|emo_joy|> I’m just glad that the academy is FINALLY progressive enough to nominate a mediocre [NAME] biopic directed by a pedophile.
"<|emo_joy|> I'm also an intj!! So uh, you can do it too ;)"
"<|emo_sad|> correct me if i’m wrong but when [NAME] eliminates [NAME], she technically has a better track record than [NAME]?? i’ll fucking cry"
<|emo_surprise|> The comics are pretty unbeliavable too
<|emo_disgust|> Why aren’t we putting guys in for garbage time?
<|emo_surprise|> Damn. Didn't know [NAME] was still making videos.
<|emo_surprise|> Can we all pitch in and buy this place instead of the Baltimore House?
<|emo_disgust|> My friends that were badly injured from the first fight. Read my backstory comment.
<|emo_anger|> Old dirty Bastard?
<|emo_joy|> My favorite parody in fact.
"<|emo_anger|> Kill em with kindness, as they say"
"<|emo_anger|> The biggest argument on your side is depreciate costs. You could challenge their concern of ""getting fooled"" by getting the car inspected by an independent."
<|emo_joy|> Me too and you made me feel better because I thought I couldn't keep up due to being old lol.
<|emo_disgust|> This is super duper nasty
<|emo_surprise|> Seriously? I have to work Monday. I can’t be thinking like that over the weekend.
"<|emo_anger|> I thought oh boy, I probably use everything on this list. Turns out, nothing. Fuck Nestle."
"<|emo_sad|> Find a better partner. It's past time to move on! He sounds very lazy, selfish, and he doesn't care about your needs."
"<|emo_anger|> The baby photos, holy fucking shit there's so many baby photos now."
"<|emo_anger|> I have a feeling you're one of those far rightist trump supporters trying to use [NAME]. Your uncaring, almost sociopathic idealogies make me sick."
<|emo_anger|> I am not running around talking about how I am going to beat up my kids teachers. Not sure where you got tough guy from that...
<|emo_fear|> what a cruelly poetic fact
"<|emo_sad|> Someone will actually spend their money on this too, that’s the sad part"
"<|emo_sad|> with his luxurious salary, nice pension and zero accountability for anything it does, its a hard old life!!!"
<|emo_sad|> Hang on so Im not allowed to stroke your dog? Thats sad.
<|emo_joy|> See him live if you haven’t already. One of my favorites to see in concert.
<|emo_joy|> Your passion for [NAME] literally put a big smile on my face. Stay wavy!
<|emo_surprise|> Oh dear [NAME]!
<|emo_joy|> I enjoyed watching the crazy old man being dragged out at the end.
<|emo_sad|> > that hurts my enjoyment of society. Then what could you possibly mean by this?
<|emo_joy|> this is amazing
<|emo_disgust|> He told you that he hates your friends because they don't beat you up? That is so disgusting!
"<|emo_sad|> He is just a kid, calm down and/or direct your anger elsewhere."
<|emo_joy|> I have silvered it as it was what I was thinking and they beat me to it hahaha
<|emo_fear|> Those ears...those horrible ears
"<|emo_joy|> 1-2-3-4 I declare a thumb war! Dangit [NAME], you win again! Ok you get to stab me again :("
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] playing sloppy
<|emo_anger|> My husband died outside the church Damn Vampires
<|emo_sad|> I was so sad when they took SG1 off of Netflix. I guess it’s on Prime now? I need to rewatch that show.
<|emo_anger|> Good for you for shutting that door! You are not responsible for him. He’s a grown ass man who made his own mistakes.
"<|emo_disgust|> I like simplicity of the Jersey, but the logo stinks."
"<|emo_joy|> Ayy, the bottom one is mine!"
<|emo_sad|> This is ugly af sry
<|emo_anger|> This sub is very very bad at irony
"<|emo_surprise|> You'd be surprised. Search this sub for the phrase, ""I'm not sold on."""
<|emo_joy|> I'm on it!
<|emo_anger|> Hell is a great town. Don't you dare conflate it with those maze and blue bastards!
<|emo_disgust|> Horrible how they just invade your space anytime any place.
<|emo_disgust|> He is like a bad cartoon that’s hard to turn off.
<|emo_fear|> Sounds dreadful.
<|emo_surprise|> I'm literally in tears right now. Everything you said is true oh my godddddddddddddd.
"<|emo_disgust|> When you feel bad, remember his comments on [NAME] throwing the shoe. He sucks."
"<|emo_joy|> If you'd like to suggest an alternative non-inflammatory metaphor for something that implies racism, I'm happy to consider it. "
"<|emo_anger|> That's awful bigoted of you, isn't it?"
<|emo_disgust|> Like who? The one guy stranded in desert already hating his life...
"<|emo_joy|> Definitely going to fail without a doubt qualified to even own my dog, and I’m happy it’s a deload week."
<|emo_anger|> >Make I've never hated a commentator more in my lifetime then him
<|emo_surprise|> > you're probably a little bit of a closeted nazi yourself. I'm just SHOCKED that someone named [NAME] might be a fascist
<|emo_surprise|> Landslide.
"<|emo_joy|> The happiest of birthdays to you, [NAME]!"
<|emo_anger|> I meant mainsource [NAME]. the one that assists you on your journey. >! not the one that is evil as fuck!<
"<|emo_joy|> Yeah, I'm happy to help an actual friend in need, but not some distant acquaintance ""friend""."
"<|emo_joy|> I'm so happy to hear you've recovered. Can I ask: are you able to maintain a healthy, stable romantic relationship?"
<|emo_fear|> My balls shrunk up looking at that
"<|emo_joy|> Me, for example. I am very very happy."
"<|emo_disgust|> > your character is so yuck Thank you, for confirming my suspicions of who/what you are."
"<|emo_disgust|> If people think that the current migrant/refugee crisis is ""bad"", they have seen nothing."
<|emo_disgust|> Watch the FO not sign anyone. That would be the most dodgers thing ever.
"<|emo_surprise|> A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one."
<|emo_anger|> She's a bloody sociopath.
<|emo_sad|> This really hurts my feelings.
"<|emo_fear|> This may be overreacting, but I would not touch those presents. There could be a bomb in them. "
<|emo_disgust|> Determined to divorce the unionist commentator from his unionism. Bizarre.
"<|emo_anger|> Nasty, nasty, nasty... Really *can't* understand why she is a 300lb human. s/"
<|emo_joy|> Haha well thank you so much! You've been the only person to say that
<|emo_disgust|> There must be some awful things happening right at this second
"<|emo_joy|> Smh. Can y’all stop being so hot? For real though congrats, you two look so happy together!"
<|emo_anger|> Studid fuckin idiot
<|emo_disgust|> oh gosh i heard about that and though it was absolutely disgusting
<|emo_joy|> I swear the low budget is what made it even better! The gnome stick is quite possibley my favorite movie prop ever
"<|emo_fear|> Completely correct. But he Might have lost control, blown a tire, etc., or maybe just panicked human error. "
"<|emo_joy|> Looking like a kid didn't exactly inspire men to treat me like a sexy woman, even though I was cute as a button. "
<|emo_sad|> Sorry if this has been covered a bunch but what happened on the play where [NAME] got injured?
"<|emo_fear|> "" [NAME] has come down with a terrible sickness which caused him to deactivate his twitter account"" Jeez sicknesses these days get worse and worse. "
<|emo_sad|> 900 IQ Play by that tracer to use her 300 Damage Ultimate on a 600HP Character who has a healing/damage resistant ability.
<|emo_anger|> Oh look another shit call
<|emo_fear|> I like to be scared actually!
<|emo_sad|> Sending love. I am so sorry you are going through this
<|emo_sad|> I am so sorry for your loss. I lost my Brother a few years back. My thoughts and heart is with you.
<|emo_disgust|> It’s harder when you have kids with the partner.
"<|emo_sad|> I’d keep at this line of dialogue but I’ve got to rewind some videocassettes, sorry. Carry on without me."
<|emo_joy|> Glad to see I'm not the only one with that bug. Maybe someone will report it some day.
<|emo_joy|> No I’m happy to spend big on myself. I’m not happy to spend my money on layabout benefits claimants.
<|emo_joy|> And I feel [NAME] in this Chili's tonight!
<|emo_sad|> What a pain. I don’t understand the tantrums whatsoever. Respectfully decline or express incompatibility and some of them just explode out of no where! Smh
<|emo_surprise|> Stunning considering you have the exact same opinion.
<|emo_sad|> What bothers me more is the picture quality of the donut compared to the steak
<|emo_anger|> I've done that in the past. It means he's stupid drunk and is missing you at the moment.
<|emo_fear|> But we're dynasty haters! We're just terrible people who don't love seeing bullshit shoved in our faces year and year out.
<|emo_joy|> What a wonderful story! Thank you so much for sharing that just made me smile .
<|emo_joy|> happy birthday dude!
<|emo_joy|> You look so happy now 😍 Hope you are doing well and that you get everything good you deserve. ❤️
<|emo_joy|> Definitely teased you ;) I think it was punishment for lifting at 8 instead of 5 this morning Prez.
"<|emo_joy|> Wow, thanks whoever did the silver❣ put a ray of sunshine into an otherwise cloudy day! "
<|emo_anger|> Piss off a small percentage to gain an even larger one? That's hardly unheard of. The amount of publicity alone for this is astounding.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow I typed that out before my eyes were awake 👀
<|emo_joy|> For real! So happy they just put season 2 on hulu
<|emo_sad|> I tell them my wife died in a car accident 10 years ago and I couldn’t fall in love again. I’ve never been married.
<|emo_anger|> What the fuck is wrong with this?!?!?!??? FUCKKKKKKKK!!!!!
<|emo_anger|> At least I dont care about any of them.
<|emo_sad|> Y’all some sharks. I’m really just out here trying to be hopeful for the future of my team after a heart shattering lost.
"<|emo_joy|> I played for a decade+ on release, I'd be happy to help you or anyone else!"
<|emo_anger|> Yes that was abuse.
"<|emo_disgust|> Good. The US is behaving shamefully, the least Canada can do is to try and pick up a little of the slack. "
<|emo_sad|> I feel sorry for her son that must have been super cringe
"<|emo_sad|> As a computer science student but also a lifelong [NAME], the issues surrounding Amazon in Queens have left me substantially torn. "
<|emo_sad|> Honestly im a pretty clumsy belligerent and i lasted 9 months and no case is great life i regret nothing
<|emo_disgust|> yuck no I'm waiting until marriage obvs
<|emo_surprise|> Really? I thought this joke was a bit plane
"<|emo_joy|> Opposite for us! My fiance cuddles me because it helps him fall asleep, then I can play video games in bed!"
<|emo_disgust|> man whenever [NAME] talks i feel like a deaf person because well I just can't hear shit
<|emo_anger|> Horribly fake. People on that thread are stupid and gullible.
"<|emo_surprise|> Really wow, what a steal"
<|emo_sad|> Looks sick actually.
<|emo_anger|> Oh my [NAME] your desk is fucked.
<|emo_joy|> Legend! Cheers bro
<|emo_surprise|> i was there in october and i was shocked at the amount of people on the interstate just casually browsing facebook while driving.
<|emo_sad|> It’s one of my worst nightmares to have skin like that...I hope that person gets actual help
<|emo_surprise|> I've always found it weird how popular Nandos is in Britain.
<|emo_joy|> People on Reddit barely know anything about law but they love to get riled up about the little that they do know
<|emo_sad|> I'd rather be tasteless than artosis
<|emo_surprise|> That was an old-fashioned Good old hockey brawl! What a fight! [NAME] definitely got the best of him though!
<|emo_joy|> Yesterday I remembered that this game existed and was happy that I waited and didn't buy into a game that would be dead in a month.
<|emo_disgust|> ‘My Goddess went to prison and all I got was this crappy t-shirt’
<|emo_anger|> At least I dont care about any of them.
"<|emo_joy|> I should have known better, its obviously not a juul. I was just happy to see Oliver Tree tbh "
"<|emo_surprise|> I haven't seen a sign like that on mine. Not that it would carry the force of law, anyway, in Florida."
<|emo_sad|> Could also be an overwhelming guilt in the heat of the moment. Probably hard to stay rational when you realize you've killed your own friend on accident.
<|emo_sad|> I'd argue they are advocating not fighting the fire in your house when the entire neighborhood is engulfed in flames.
"<|emo_fear|> I stand corrected, my apologies to the mods. I'd personally like to see more banned or removed but at least they handled the most egregious."
<|emo_surprise|> Wow Jurassic Park looks a lot different than in the cinema
"<|emo_surprise|> What?! Now you are just reaching bro. He's not even the best bodybuilder named [NAME], [NAME] has him beat."
<|emo_fear|> Threatening to drive your sisters into the ocean is illegal. It's called making a terroristic threat or menacing and can cause her to lose access to your sisters
<|emo_joy|> Happy cake day and happy birthday! I'm sorry your friend bailed on you.
<|emo_anger|> Pull that sucker right up to your face
"<|emo_anger|> Say thos: mom, dad, she's busted. Respect my wishes!"
<|emo_joy|> Honestly acid is fun with 4-6 friends and shrooms is fun with 1-3 friends
<|emo_sad|> Damn it. Don't mention [NAME]. Just makes me sad thinking what could have been.
<|emo_joy|> Shootouts aren’t our strong suit. Happy to get out with a point though
<|emo_anger|> Stop spraying chemicals daily in the sky.
<|emo_disgust|> 🤷‍♂️ weird flex but ok
<|emo_anger|> Lmao what's the difference neither one is refrigerated. People are fucking stupid
<|emo_joy|> Ah true blue love
<|emo_joy|> This was the most fun I've had watching a game since [NAME] 35 point game
<|emo_anger|> That was horrible defending what the hell
"<|emo_fear|> I gotta say, that was a WELL fought period. I was worried a couple times..."
<|emo_sad|> Because all our society has done for the past 60 years is talk about your problems.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is getting huge
<|emo_anger|> BLESS THIS WOMAN AND HER EVIL FAMILY
<|emo_fear|> That's the perfect intro for a panic ult.
<|emo_fear|> Oh I didn't know. Please give me his P.O. Box address so I can submit them immediately. Cause I am definitely uninterested in blowing out my intestines.
<|emo_disgust|> Wow what a fucking autist. Probably more effort into this shit than all people that hate on GS combined.
<|emo_joy|> Shai-Hulud! Bless the maker and his water
<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe he used the N-word.
<|emo_joy|> Doesn't help that it's not actually cheese. Looks like a pretty standard Vegan mac+whatever you wanna call it
"<|emo_joy|> Glad you are resting better, and as for your friend he deserves the brownie points. "
"<|emo_joy|> Oh my goodness, I'm so glad you were there too. You made his day suck a little less. "
<|emo_disgust|> Mr [NAME] is operater as fuck
<|emo_joy|> All the game modes are super fun
"<|emo_sad|> [NAME], I’ve slaughtered [NAME] today, but the man has balls, I’ll give him that"
<|emo_fear|> that was a horrible fix
"<|emo_sad|> Yep, it was faked. Too bad, too"
<|emo_fear|> the older me would be scared shirtless knowing all the fireworks that exploded nearly in my hand as a kid
<|emo_joy|> Hahaha thanks for sharing that is simply amazing. You probably gave the buyer a good laugh too.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is an embarrassment to this state
<|emo_anger|> No credit?? This is the brilliant youtube channel You Suck At Cooking
<|emo_sad|> But I feel like such a tool!
<|emo_surprise|> A grumpy old gardener in a rubber mask?
<|emo_sad|> Precisely why im closeted :(
"<|emo_anger|> You have too many knives, I don't trust you. Sociopath."
"<|emo_anger|> yet another infuriating loss, against a garbage team no less"
<|emo_surprise|> Omg at this rate he's gonna be in the next smash bros
<|emo_anger|> Removed and warned. R1
"<|emo_joy|> I like the energy [NAME], [NAME], DFS put out."
<|emo_anger|> There is a special place in hell for drivers like you. I pray to [NAME] there is.
<|emo_disgust|> It's the worst when it's something you are passionate about
<|emo_joy|> I would love to watch you become jaded by [NAME].
<|emo_disgust|> Must be a terrible swim team. The only thing that your neck beard does is accentuates your double chin.
"<|emo_disgust|> Virtually no happiness anymore, exhausted with trying, meds not working properly and just tired of it all."
<|emo_surprise|> Hell yeah! I can't wait for the rust to break off and for people to be as excited as they were years ago.
<|emo_joy|> It's vodka/tonic time for me buddy! I'm off work!!!! Hope all yaw be safe and have a great night!
"<|emo_disgust|> You're analogies are terrible and prove the opposite of what you were arguing, numb skull 😂"
<|emo_disgust|> This is child abuse. No decent parent would force their kid to starve just because they don't understand science and nutrition
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] sucks. Rally killee
<|emo_anger|> Poisoned by his enemies.
<|emo_anger|> He's transcended fuck-you-money to fuck-me-money territory
<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit I was so anxious reading this. I’m so sorry
"<|emo_sad|> They probably take slight step back, by that I mean still the best defense in the league, but closer."
<|emo_surprise|> Oh really. Go ahead and try to reason with an [RELIGION] government that their power should be limited. Good luck.
"<|emo_joy|> The first half is able to run on the momentum of being stupid fun, the second half falls apart really quick."
<|emo_joy|> The important thing is that you're having fun
<|emo_joy|> That’s my luck. Lol
<|emo_joy|> Oh it is going to be glorious.
<|emo_disgust|> *what the fuck*
<|emo_anger|> I'd also report to the post office... and next time these nasty neighbors come-give them the number to call and complain.
<|emo_joy|> I used to enjoy it and grew out of it.
"<|emo_joy|> I already have used one, really helped "
<|emo_disgust|> He was forced into this marriage
<|emo_sad|> Gonna be sad when Gameday is inside a gym for shooty hoops. I already miss CFB :(
"<|emo_joy|> Man, she took it pretty well. I’d be screaming my damn head off. "
"<|emo_anger|> That was a hell of a tip, that happens"
<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. But I am proud of you for calling him out.
<|emo_anger|> You'd be stupid not to do this.
"<|emo_disgust|> Please get your soy away from me, i’m allergic."
"<|emo_joy|> I agree with this. I'm extremely happy with the hires, but I think the draft may be a bigger tell tale on how the off-season goes."
"<|emo_sad|> If my mom were still alive, she'd be so pissed at [NAME] being in this cast."
<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck Edit: YOOOO I SWEAR MY DOOKU JUST SAID ONE OF HIS EMOTES IN A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE
<|emo_disgust|> His chin is recessed. How the fuck does he have decent lower face
"<|emo_joy|> y'know, I should try that haha... (music gets depressing) ha"
<|emo_disgust|> Ugh... hate when people talk to me when I'm fishing. This would be so awful hahaha
"<|emo_disgust|> >Morality is always subjective because morality is decided by people/society. Congratulations, you’ve found the worst take ever. "
"<|emo_joy|> Thanks, it’s funny how to me this seemed a leap but not one person agrees, lol"
"<|emo_surprise|>  ### A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one "
<|emo_surprise|> We're ALL what's wrong with this country
<|emo_anger|> None at all. I dont like kids and dont want them. I got a vasectomy and it's a done deal. Zero regrets
<|emo_disgust|> Fuck the cubs
"<|emo_surprise|> With the weather we are having, it is a surprise when a battery works."
<|emo_joy|> Happy New year! 🤗
"<|emo_joy|> Thanks for reply, I'll enjoy reading through the comments... maybe you make a book of it all. "
<|emo_fear|> I am. He's the easy pick. Would be perfect for this franchise. I'm worried that he won't make it to us.
"<|emo_anger|> It’s not unlikely that his family was already imprisoned or dead, which gave him the window to run. "
<|emo_disgust|> That’s part of why I hate porn so much - other than the exploitation of women
<|emo_anger|> I want my fucking cake back.
<|emo_surprise|> I was surprised to see [NAME] towing the line on his show.
<|emo_disgust|> Weird but effective
<|emo_disgust|> Aw bummer. She lost her screenshot of the copy of a copy of bullshit articles handwritten in 1992. Somebody help a girl out.
"<|emo_joy|> Enjoy a weekend of eating ice cream 100% guilt free. (That's standard practice for wisdom teeth still, right?)"
<|emo_disgust|> I mean yeah but it still sucks. Hopefully you have better luck in the future.
<|emo_surprise|> Maybe someone up there is wondering what it's like here
<|emo_joy|> Wow that's just like when I sing it
<|emo_joy|> The BrokenMachine has one of these videos but I'm definitely going to watch yours. Thank you for taking the time to do this.
<|emo_joy|> Cool have fun
<|emo_sad|> When people bring up rape culture they mean stuff like this. Because yeah it’s been out and swept away and not raged over
<|emo_disgust|> She ran a laughably bad Senate campaign in 2014 and hasn’t gotten positive PR since. Not too worried.
"<|emo_disgust|> That was such a bad yellow, he had the height and positional advantage such a bad challenge"
<|emo_disgust|> Putting any human on the same level as [NAME] is sacrilegious and you should be ashamed for spreading such blasphemy.
"<|emo_surprise|> It’s almost like a lot of Yankees fans are giants fans, and a lot of pats fans are Sox fans. So. Weird."

<|emo_disgust|> She sounds hideous.
"<|emo_surprise|> I'm not surprised at all considering, you know, buzzfeed "

<|emo_joy|> My pleasure ☺️ hope you enjoy! She seems very sweet.
"<|emo_sad|> Good lord, that 'chandelier' made entirely out of antlers is pretty ridiculous 👀 "

<|emo_disgust|> That awkward moment when people who passionately hate [NAME] inadvertently portray him as a hero.
<|emo_surprise|> How fortunate you're able to whine about it without being censored...
"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], for when you want to be a healer but also want a FUCK EVERYONE AROUND ME button. Although I’ve been maiming [NAME] recently."
"<|emo_anger|> But this was a supposed psychopath attack, which can happen to anyone, not a rape attack that mostly happens to women"

<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if these little creatures with their big bulgy eyes ever poke themselves in the eyes accidentally.
"<|emo_disgust|> I had a similar problem. Turned out to be technology, and overstimulation. Turned off the screens before dinner and had much better sleep."
<|emo_anger|> No no forms or anything. I was pleading with them not to go and it seemed surreal that I was being forced to go
<|emo_sad|> I know a guy who is 25 (same age as me) and has FOUR. I would hate my life so much.
<|emo_sad|> He's sick of people spelling his name wrong.
<|emo_anger|> They do it way more often than you do and they give even less of a fuck. It's normal.

<|emo_disgust|> That looks like total garbage.
"<|emo_sad|> I wish, the brainwashed idiots here in California love her. It makes me sick. California is a lost cause."
<|emo_joy|> Glad you got to see a good one!
<|emo_sad|> Sad thing is it would probably forcibly ground the plane.
<|emo_disgust|> That was truly disgusting
"<|emo_sad|> Lol, I’m so sorry for u. Do u go down on her a lot? If so she need to give something too..."
<|emo_anger|> And suck this guy off at the same time
<|emo_surprise|> Wow. If it shows calls on the bill then what good is it? Glad I asked...
"<|emo_surprise|> You guys are heading toward healing, that's amazing.. Is it possible that you are wishes on true healing "
<|emo_joy|> USA Trash is [NAME] beloved gift to Canada. Thanks [NAME]. Nice hair though!

"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] a fuckboy, he was never your boyfriend."
<|emo_joy|> I lowkey love the chicken and waffles from longhorn chicken. It’s a food truck in west campus.
<|emo_surprise|> With those pieces I’d be surprised 😒
<|emo_joy|> I was expecting this to go MUCH worse than it did and I’m so glad my imagination wasn’t right.
<|emo_sad|> That is profoundly messed up.

<|emo_disgust|> Stop being disgusting. I dont know if you know this but all dogs are naked.
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] wore shoes and killed millions. For [NAME] like me, people who wear shoes have become a symbol of hatred and murder."
<|emo_disgust|> That was what was most nauseating for me honestly. Not a single period used once.
"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] and [NAME] may be stronger, but [NAME] just gone mad. She's lost the plot for sure."
"<|emo_anger|> I mean I still attend regular school, this is just a Saturday school. I'm just frustrated that I have to waste Saturday on this"

"<|emo_joy|> Huh that guy seems cool, they'd probably lop his head off. "
<|emo_surprise|> I hear the ruler's control is remote and is viewed with great reception.
<|emo_sad|> You are one pathetic human being.
<|emo_anger|> Worst advice ever. This would piss me off.
<|emo_joy|> The best part was when the Audience thought [NAME] worm had gone “unnoticed” by th Department of Justice.
<|emo_anger|> Your just killing time now.
<|emo_joy|> I thought he had a cool [NAME]. Was only slightly disappointed.
<|emo_fear|> Why does everyone keep assuming that we’ll suddenly sign big name FA’s? This is a terrible idea.
<|emo_disgust|> Gross. She did is so cruel ever. Document this report to cops against her.. And Disown/cut cruel family is best gift.
"<|emo_sad|> I am now sad the latest Thief was so mediocre, because the actual City the game took place in was a great little world."

<|emo_anger|> BSN Broncos is the place to be for the off season. Just go there
<|emo_anger|> You severely misunderstand the evidence if your answer is 'NO TO ALL' regarding your questions. Especially the last one.
"<|emo_anger|> Never understood the attachment to cats personally, letting them in and out and back onto the bed. It’s just not normal and gross."
<|emo_joy|> His Batman/TMNT book is a really fun read with great art.
"<|emo_disgust|> It is so ugly I felt personally attacked by it, what can I say"
<|emo_anger|> I'M MR. [NAME]! HOW DID WE GET ROPED INTO THIS?
"<|emo_joy|> Right now I'm listening to Stand By Me, I'm liking it "
"<|emo_sad|> From my experience minoxidil only stops loss, unfortunately it doesn't encourage new growth"
<|emo_anger|> Then don’t read it. You don’t have to make a salty comment.
<|emo_joy|> [NAME]? Is that you?
<|emo_sad|> Ugh. Sounds awful. I’m sorry :(
<|emo_disgust|> This is awful.
<|emo_anger|> Because they are idiots.
"<|emo_surprise|> You should watch the “Genghis Khan” music video by [NAME], suddenly these two really look like the couple in that video 😳"
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME], but they all seem to be genuinely happy with their lives and supporting each other, so I’m happy for them too"
<|emo_surprise|> What the fuck is [NAME] doing in the background
<|emo_disgust|> I was thinking that as well after I posted. Some nasty stuff settles on ceiling tiles.
<|emo_sad|> Sad for the people who contracted measles. Angry at the parents who didn't vaccinate their kids against measles.
<|emo_surprise|> Is that a real tweet? From the actual president? Not a parody? I can't tell anymore.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Did u say yes?
<|emo_anger|> Talk about a fucking hot take. Quality shit posting from [NAME] (not you [NAME]).
<|emo_surprise|> I think I saw some eyeball flying!
"<|emo_joy|> Though I encourage! For an opportunity to play a game of such grand anticipation as this, is a sweet fortune."
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is actually a terrible player
"<|emo_joy|> Happy for him, great game. "
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] my God. That was the best free throw shooting ive ever seen.
<|emo_fear|> The fact that this being brought up makes it a real scary feeling.

<|emo_sad|> The real problem is the malicious prosecution engaged in by Monsanto against small farmers.
<|emo_surprise|> Why? I don’t think I’ve ever seen someone not like [NAME] irl or here. Witten I can see though.
<|emo_surprise|> I’m shocked at how big that defeat is.
"<|emo_joy|> Hello [NAME], my new friend. "
"<|emo_joy|> ""one of us will be right!"" Or...ya both wrong and wasted your energy being dumb asses instead of enjoying it."
"<|emo_surprise|> He actually did, couldn't believe it."
<|emo_joy|> No it was a joke
<|emo_fear|> You're a horrible person.
<|emo_sad|> What a beautiful memory for you to have found. So sorry for your loss ❤️

"<|emo_anger|> Damn, politics *does* make strange bedfellows."
<|emo_surprise|> You would be floored to hear how many times I played Portal 2...
"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]? Nah, that's him in the background. The idiot with the leaves is [NAME]. It's always fucking [NAME]."

<|emo_surprise|> Oh of course!
<|emo_sad|> Sorry to hear that was all it got :/
<|emo_joy|> Good thing I don't give a shit.
<|emo_anger|> I think you may just be an asshole/moron bud... sorry.
"<|emo_joy|> My god, [NAME]!"
<|emo_anger|> Idk some dudes think a girl needs an ass full of cellulite to be considered thick.
<|emo_disgust|> I'll take the Akot 3 but man that shot is ugly

"<|emo_joy|> Nah, some cake sniffers were enjoying the books way before."
<|emo_fear|> It is weird to be having sex at all at 15.
<|emo_disgust|> This lady argued with me for wanting a 0 guard on the side for my fade. Walked out.
<|emo_fear|> Hell's Kitchen. I bet that man could make [NAME] cry.
"<|emo_joy|> Great deal for us, happy he's back. Up next, [NAME]! "
"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME], that's pretty damn good for a state like Virginia, which, although not a swing state anymore, was red not so long ago. "
<|emo_joy|> Glad to see Mrs. [NAME] is still alive and well!
<|emo_anger|> Yeah but FGM is basically like cutting off the head of the penis entirely. I'm uncut myself but I get why people do it
<|emo_surprise|> Shocked we didn't take him back and plunk him in the minors.
<|emo_joy|> Consider yourself lucky haha. I used to call my local radio station daily to request they play it ‍♀️
<|emo_disgust|> You’ve become the very thing you swore to destroy
"<|emo_disgust|> Entire new coaching philosophy is needed. Enough wasted possessions, contested iso mid-range jumpers with 15 seconds left on the shot clock and terrible 3pt defense."
"<|emo_sad|> I hope you're ok, I feel this post :( big hugs from me"
"<|emo_sad|> ""Why everyone hurts me?"""
<|emo_sad|> I can't remember a time during my early childhood where I didn't dress up like my mom and almost break my little ankles in her heels
"<|emo_joy|> Awesome, let's celebrate! Send the free pack over here ;)"
<|emo_anger|> Shes awful and its all about her. Try again. And when the show has awful ratings thatll be confirmed.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh I forgot all about Jing Wei! Is rage worth building? I'm wondering if the loss in attack speed is worth it for extra crit chance.
<|emo_joy|> Me too. One of my favorite potential Dem candidates
<|emo_joy|> Good. Now we just need people to dislike commies more than they do now
"<|emo_fear|> i had all of those. checked myself with a GP and found out i had low iron, migraines and needed to visit the therapist re my anxiety."

"<|emo_surprise|> Something's wrong. The top post on r/conspiracy isn't completely anti-conspiracy? Wow, feels weird. /s(?)"
"<|emo_anger|> The attraction and the action are two separate things, and you know that. No one chooses who they are attracted to. Stop it. "
"<|emo_disgust|> Dark and funny, but not really nice guy. He has yet to call the dead girls whores for declining to sleep with him. "
<|emo_disgust|> And if that's the case then there is no helping him. It sucks that those people can't be helped
<|emo_sad|> I was just gonna say this look like fake karma.
<|emo_joy|> I’m really glad [NAME] wasn’t [NAME]
<|emo_anger|> ??? Where the hell is this article getting it's data from...
<|emo_surprise|> This...has 9k upvotes. Wow.
"<|emo_anger|> The [RELIGION] Church has been raping children for decades, that we know about. More likely hundreds of years. Probably since they've existed. "
<|emo_anger|> I hate you.
<|emo_disgust|> no idea how [NAME] was a [NAME] or [NAME]. just awful
<|emo_disgust|> He is just awful enough to do something like that.
<|emo_joy|> I like these kinds of multicultural projects. Very much in line with my feels about South Africa.
<|emo_fear|> Poor wee thing is probably terrified somewhere.
<|emo_fear|> Of course. It would mean you owe them an unspecified favor in the future. That would be horrible.
<|emo_joy|> Looks like they did it to scare everyone else on the road as a dominance game.
<|emo_sad|> I forgot about that. 😂
<|emo_sad|> I was sad to see emails from multiple downtown restaurants offering free delivery through grubhub. Deliveries are going to be brutal.
<|emo_anger|> Fuck Up would be more appropriate. Fuckin marketing wankers.

<|emo_disgust|> I heard [NAME] was an absolute monster too... Jk folks
<|emo_joy|> That's why it would be amazing if [NAME] or [NAME] pull a Helsinki 2.0 and release a bombshell right before the president's speech tonight.
<|emo_fear|> I learned that recently driving into SLC for the first time in the rain/snow. I couldn't see shit. 1/10 Was scary.
<|emo_anger|> I don't define myself by my sexuality. Conservatives who want to kill me do.
<|emo_disgust|> its treason then
<|emo_fear|> Don't forget colors. They panic at the sight of a chess board.
<|emo_sad|> I’m sorry he’s treating people this way. You will find even greater and less costly bliss!
<|emo_joy|> lol..You're not getting [NAME] or any of the young core..
<|emo_joy|> Lol the lefties are gonna see their arses over this!
<|emo_surprise|> I still can't believe that dude in Whangarei is still allowed to run his business. I wonder how much longer he will keep it up.
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]. They’re grasping for straws!
<|emo_anger|> You mean defy their nation's people and f*ck them over.

"<|emo_disgust|> Weird, I thought I had a different twitter handle than that"
"<|emo_sad|> I like [NAME] so far, but I know I'm alone in that."
<|emo_joy|> I actually really like it the way it is now! The pink sky with only a few clouds is different and very cool.
<|emo_surprise|> I never even knew there were bullies in school unit I was out of school and read about bullies in school.
<|emo_joy|> I sure hope so. I wanna cry tears of joy knowing [NAME] and [NAME] rode off into the sunset with one last ring.

<|emo_sad|> I’m offended that your offended
<|emo_anger|> Look at that shit-eating grin
<|emo_sad|> Lol you wish it was that easy. Lying POS customers have the advantage with review websites sadly.
"<|emo_sad|> This is heartbreaking. She always meant well, and really wanted to see people get along. She deserved happiness."
<|emo_sad|> Actually there are some terminals now that let you disable it lmao. Very sad.
<|emo_joy|> Right :-) The rookie was so scared to show his hand and he thought his two pairs weren’t good and thought he had lost.
<|emo_joy|> It happened and I'm very happy
<|emo_disgust|> So prison isn't enough? You want him raped? That's disgusting.
"<|emo_joy|> Mmmm, I sure do love some Vaseline on a hot piece of toast in the morning. "
<|emo_anger|> his traps hide the fucking sun.
<|emo_sad|> I'm disappointed in you too.
<|emo_sad|> Incels dont get laid regardless of age limits. Sorry dude
<|emo_surprise|> that's horrifying
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] is giving me the 2016 AO vibes... hope he doesn't get injured again
"<|emo_surprise|> Haha I’m not expecting anything at considering they’re 2,000 miles away from me. I’ll be surprised if she does give me numbers,"
<|emo_disgust|> The similarity to cigarette companies is eerie.
<|emo_joy|> Lmfao. Omg I’m dead. Please do more of these somehow
<|emo_anger|> I've seen AOCs ridiculous proposals
<|emo_fear|> I was so scared to click that. Yet I did.
<|emo_anger|> proper fucking order
<|emo_sad|> He's eating cheese and watching football in the sky now. Rest in peace!
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, pulling her by her hair and throwing her on the ground doesn't exactly say ""respect me"" in any way."
<|emo_surprise|> Ohmigoodness! I've never seen this before! All the gracias to you!
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] dude I see [NAME] so rarely that I forget that he's the OG ""Fuck this character fuck this stupid game"" king. "
<|emo_sad|> Preach my dude I know how it feels to get downvoted by the sheep
<|emo_surprise|> My money is on [NAME]. Doubt [NAME] is back up next yr. [NAME] looked.good last preseason. I was surprised he didn't beat [NAME] then.
<|emo_joy|> Having fuck tons of fun right now
<|emo_anger|> BEHOLD THE GREAT GRAIN [NAME] BECKONS US TO ITS CHAMBER! FOLLOW ME MY FELLOW BIRDS INTO THE ABYSS!
<|emo_sad|> Was injured a lot his rookie year too. And had trouble handling [NAME] duties.
"<|emo_joy|> This should in r/funny not here, very expected"

<|emo_disgust|> Cold approach is a huge waste of time due to the ratio of success-failure
"<|emo_disgust|> Hi from a former [NAME]! Enjoy all the snow this weekend, we're barely getting anything in Iowa, which is frankly ridiculous. "
"<|emo_fear|> I worry that as soon as VR and AR take off, it'll be the nail in the coffin and we will be trapped."
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] being the ROY and the DSJ situation has def distracted the media on how bad [NAME] has been
<|emo_joy|> Because you are young and it happens. You feel like you’ll never find someone else but you will.
"<|emo_sad|> I know, pain in the asses."
<|emo_surprise|> She is still a billionaire. I guess stupid Tweets are going to bankrupt her?
<|emo_joy|> Glad you got to see a good one!
"<|emo_joy|> Glad you are resting better, and as for your friend he deserves the brownie points. "
<|emo_disgust|> That couple were jerks. I am glad you made them move.
<|emo_anger|> So much effort for such terrible person!
<|emo_surprise|> It continually amazes me how many people don't understand this.
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] clan needs some fucking therapy.
"<|emo_anger|> They seem to have very ""sick"" laws in Saudi Arabia. Where women don't have any protection from government against their perpetrators."
<|emo_joy|> happy cake day.
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] Almighty. This may be the most empathetic and compassionate reddit thread I've ever seen! Who ever said drunks were mean? Terrible stereotype.
<|emo_anger|> daaaaaamn girl!
<|emo_fear|> Watching it deteriorate into a horrific dystopia. Healthcare costs. Dental. Low wages.
<|emo_anger|> Bloody useless Pakistan
"<|emo_disgust|> ‘Twas not MRSA, just ick, apparently."
<|emo_surprise|> Same.. I wonder why we catastrophize over these minor things so much and others seem to be able to forget them..
"<|emo_fear|> [NAME] no, these are horrid on anyone."
<|emo_joy|> I'm so glad the Ontario government sold off that money pit. /s
<|emo_joy|> Then enjoy your shutdown!

<|emo_anger|> Goddamn it Your username just started a song in my head 👶🦈
<|emo_fear|> Don’t worry about the baby but yes worry about your mom...
"<|emo_sad|> That’s unfortunate! Without having knowledge of the incident, it’s difficult to say why the surgeon had liability."
<|emo_joy|> .. :< you're welcome ;;
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] i want to slap the shit out of her
<|emo_disgust|> People done be ignorant
<|emo_joy|> Well good luck and have fun!

<|emo_anger|> This is something that has to be learned from experience. Don't be hard on yourself!
"<|emo_sad|> I actually rooted for you guys that Seahawks game, but now I feel the true pain. "
<|emo_fear|> Trial by jury of my peers is honestly my worst fear
<|emo_sad|> This hit way too close to home. I’m suing for emotional damage.
"<|emo_surprise|> I pose you this question, ""How do you know [RELIGION] is not the right religion?"""
"<|emo_anger|> Illegal workers have no rights, no recourse to the law in the face of mistreatment. Abusive employers like that."
"<|emo_joy|> Congrats! Enjoy a free slice, I think you know what to do with this 🍕"
<|emo_fear|> Look we are starving but we still have some honor. We don't need any help from your people. Especially not 50 cents a day
<|emo_joy|> That was honestly my first thought I’m so glad someone else went there too
"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], aside from the goal was several magnitudes worse than [NAME]...."
<|emo_joy|> Niemi is absolutely amazing tonight
<|emo_joy|> This one is hitting people that knew him hard. He was such a happy guy all the time. Hopefully they catch the bastard soon.
<|emo_joy|> Well the good news is once all the boomers die off you won't have any pesky old people to blame anymore.
<|emo_disgust|> I just mean symbolically it's weird to call your own flesh a 'blanket'.
<|emo_surprise|> How's the pp looking?
"<|emo_anger|> But seriously, you're probably going to feel very sick "
<|emo_joy|> Healthy attitude here
<|emo_anger|> Putting any human on the same level as [NAME] is sacrilegious and you should be ashamed for spreading such blasphemy.
<|emo_joy|> That’d be lovely. Although now I have to root for AD to the Lakers which makes my chest hurt
"<|emo_disgust|> > Mother wasn't amused and I was forced to smile and bare it Wow, I would hate taking nude family portraits"
<|emo_sad|> Our education system has been a complete and utter failure...
<|emo_fear|> That is absolutely terrifying to me. Oh my god. The idea that she was trapped as a toddler her entire life is just... wow.
<|emo_joy|> Very light onset compared to the Pharma 10s I had past year. Arrived ND though so no regrets.
<|emo_fear|> Yep gave me goosebumps.
"<|emo_anger|> Block me,report me, do what you gotta do, you don't own reddit."
<|emo_anger|> So? Keep doing it anyway. Who don't worry about the downvotes.
"<|emo_joy|> Glad to see you were able to get this worked out, thx for the update! "
<|emo_disgust|> Apparently we are tragedies!
"<|emo_anger|> Shut up, don’t block the sanctimony train."
<|emo_anger|> I do this but but feel better in the end because I use it for procrastination. It's a weird combinational to feel better and worse while cleaning.
<|emo_joy|> How mature of you. Resorting to name-calling is delightfully childish. I expected nothing less.
<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit I didn’t realize he didn’t fumble all season that’s wild
<|emo_surprise|> Pull your fucking pants up oh my god
"<|emo_disgust|> Her reply is immoral and disgusting but it is also brilliant. She's not trying to convince intelligent people, she's trying to motivate angry jealous people."
<|emo_sad|> Sorry about that. I hope the fix is more appropriate. Thank you!
<|emo_fear|> Right like interacting with each other having a normal evening? Ugh they’re both so trashy I’m sorry.
"<|emo_surprise|> Me, too. Was shocked to say the least."
<|emo_fear|> It would need immediate medical attention and hospitalisation. Might be fatal due to liver failure.
<|emo_anger|> stupid science bitches
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] Wednesday’s 😎 Good to know he’s enjoying the retirement life. 
<|emo_disgust|> I thought for a moment the one mongoose was dead after watching the other one drag it.
<|emo_surprise|> We still have this?!!!!!!!! What?!
"<|emo_disgust|> Besides it being hard and fucking up your kettles, irons, hair and taps?"
"<|emo_anger|> Slap her hand if she is trying to force you to do anything! Tell her not to put her hands on you, and enforce it every time. "
<|emo_joy|> Hahaha good point!
"<|emo_joy|> Enjoy a weekend of eating ice cream 100% guilt free. (That's standard practice for wisdom teeth still, right?)"
<|emo_joy|> I love going out in treacherous weather. For real.
"<|emo_anger|> Lack of content, which led to shipping wars, which destroyed everybody’s minds, which created this."
"<|emo_surprise|> OHHHHH! THAT ONE! Oh, *[NAME]*... "
<|emo_disgust|> I both loathe and applaud you
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]. Has a great bit about how negative everyone is about everything.
<|emo_anger|> Here we go. What’s wrong with them.
<|emo_joy|> Glad you came to your senses. Go feel uncomfortable about Lola bunny in Space Jam again.
<|emo_anger|> Who the fuck leaves a hot iron on the couch
<|emo_sad|> Reality is often disappointing
"<|emo_surprise|> Hmm surprised that went on for as long as it did, at some point there must have been some redeeming qualities. "
"<|emo_joy|> Reminds me to the movie [NAME]. ""I saw it in a movie, it will work!"""
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what would happen if you did the same thing to him.
<|emo_joy|> I'm happy I live in a country where machete attacks don't have to be a real concern.
<|emo_anger|> 30 you illiterate fuck
"<|emo_anger|> You armchair analysed it, and were entirely wrong. Literally none of what you said was true, because it was all pretend. "
<|emo_surprise|> What a finish
<|emo_joy|> It is a very common verbal tic among tri-state Italian-American women of that generation and older. It takes me back to my old babysitter so vividly.
"<|emo_joy|> Yes indeed, the “just a joke, bro” ship sailed long ago. "
<|emo_joy|> Crazy how [NAME] put out his first album at the tender age of 1
<|emo_fear|> She clearly was too afraid to speak up.
<|emo_sad|> 140k CAN dollar worth NOT 140K BTC. Sorry I did not understood your original question
<|emo_anger|> Bitch yes!
<|emo_joy|> She's a ~~chill cat~~ woman of few words.
"<|emo_sad|> Not all men harass women, but enough of them are that all women have *been* harassed by men."
"<|emo_sad|> Hm so sad. Am I supposed to feel bad for you because you don't look like [NAME] phelps? Btw, he's on steroids no doubt"
<|emo_joy|> Glad there's someone on here with a little sanity.
<|emo_joy|> That couple were jerks. I am glad you made them move.
<|emo_sad|> Yes the achilles gave out and so did my hopes. I miss brandon :(
<|emo_fear|> I’m about to have a heart attack tonight
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME]...
"<|emo_joy|> Thanks...One year in making, I hope it gets the love it deserve. "
"<|emo_fear|> cancer is incredibly difficult to get a vaccine from, since it is unique to everyone. Different DNA in each one. both are hard to cure."
<|emo_anger|> 70 year old me doesn't give a fuck just piss or get off the pot!
"<|emo_anger|> It looks like those ""true facts"" memes are coming back, too. SHUT IT DOWN, OTTO."
<|emo_disgust|> Tell her to stop eating shit and start using mouthwash.
<|emo_fear|> Don't stop cold turkey. It's dangerous and you can have deadly seizures. Taper down if you are going to quit any benzo.
"<|emo_anger|> Grow up and get a job, nobody cares about your autistic memes. "
<|emo_anger|> If you don't mind cutting your life opportunities by 3/4 go for it.
<|emo_disgust|> Look at that piece of shit covering his badge number. I hope he loses his job over this. What a lowlife piece of shit.
<|emo_disgust|> I know so I also make a joke about how we’re going to give bell so much money that we’ll be in the negative for cap
<|emo_anger|> It's beyond evil. It is pure demonic when it's that pure sadism and vile sick torture. I hate them guys.
<|emo_disgust|> ugh their mind
<|emo_fear|> These were one of the worst commentators I have ever been forced to listen to. The jokes were so cringe-worthy.
<|emo_disgust|> >[NAME] later admits to his brother he killed me ~~cause he hates bards~~ because he doesn't have the chops to run a robust encounter. FIFY
<|emo_sad|> That's really sad and shocking to hear this Really embarrassed to be a human being on this earth...
<|emo_joy|> Id give my left nut for another [NAME]. ...and im a berkeley liberal. THATS how crazy the party has gotten.
"<|emo_fear|> Oh, doi. Makes total sense now. Boy I really hope I get fired for this blunder."
"<|emo_anger|> A small sample size can also be skewed the opposite direction, who’s to say the rape rate wouldn’t be much higher "
"<|emo_surprise|> Thank you mods for the sticky. This is such an important story. To my surprise, the NY Times had a brief piece about it."
"<|emo_surprise|> Life must be difficult for her then, I'm surprised she can leave her home. Hopefully she finds help if she wants it. "
<|emo_sad|> That goddamn wink slayed me. Swoon so hard...
"<|emo_sad|> He’s a coward, but no need to ruin his life. You should feel sorry for him. "
<|emo_anger|> Watt made you think this was funny?
<|emo_disgust|> It's weird that actual socialists will say that politics has moved far to the right.
<|emo_anger|> That's such a selfish mentality to have.
<|emo_fear|> I remembered it slightly differently. My brain is terrible for coming up with this one: [NAME] Long Thick Penis Has Come To Town.
<|emo_joy|> AMD this is why we rejoice in his banning.... :)
<|emo_disgust|> I thinks he's the leader of one those Turkish backed rebel groups. He was accused of raping the wife of one his soldiers and screwing prostitutes.
<|emo_sad|> I honestly miss [NAME]
"<|emo_fear|> Damn, that's dark"
<|emo_joy|> I was born in 1980 so the 90s were my teen decade. I loved it. Best decade ever
<|emo_anger|> Her Twitter checks also clearly a fucking idiot.
<|emo_sad|> I feel this but I also sympathize with mentalcels because I’m mentally ill and it makes me feel even worse.
<|emo_disgust|> It sure smells and feels nice. I also don’t find my hands as dry as usual compared to bar soap.
<|emo_anger|> They also think you're a jealous man instead of an honest - though not very nice - woman.
<|emo_joy|> It’s always nice to say something [nice]!
"<|emo_joy|> Bring them into your home, feed them, love them and have a sign made that says ""cat sanctuary"" and hang it above your front door. "
"<|emo_fear|> Omg, I'm so sorry. I'm sending you love. That's horrible. :/ Are you doing okay?"

<|emo_fear|> >very creepy horror-themed Very accurate description and only from a few second piece of an audio recording
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] I hate that I had to upvote this dude to the sub it is in. Every fibre of my being wants to downvote this atrocity
<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting. No one should act like that to you. I'm so sorry that happened.
"<|emo_sad|> 55 here. Of course, I could never catch me one of those wonderful incels."
"<|emo_anger|> Don’t be saucy with me, mister! I ain’t Alfredo you! "
"<|emo_joy|> I'm so glad [NAME] finally got her visa, she's going to do awesome living in the USA!!!!"
<|emo_sad|> And the dude dropped his phone between those slots... ouch!
"<|emo_anger|> No, stop! He'll stop cranking the job machine if you insult him again!"
<|emo_anger|> What about urban [NAME] supporters who are socially liberal and want to see tax dollars used efficiently?
"<|emo_disgust|> > The porn that I downloaded was Brazzers produced. In case you don't know, Brazzers is ***anal*** about their IP. Ha get fucked."
<|emo_sad|> With a lot of severe brain damage after being beat back to life with an ugly stick.
"<|emo_sad|> As a teacher with a bunch of sick students, this scares the hell out of me."
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] what a stupid job
"<|emo_anger|> If you eat plants, you are eating animal’s food. That is so cruel!"
"<|emo_surprise|> The dress was trailer trash appropriate. Did he just run out of money for a good dress? I mean, $300 BLACK UNDIES."
<|emo_joy|> Me too. At least we acknowledge what we are and don't make up excuses in that regard.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. Except gillette i haven't used aby P&G products in years
<|emo_surprise|> Reddit is so right wing I can’t even believe it
<|emo_fear|> He had been so worried that the stepmom would have a hard time integrating into the family.
"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, I thought she was calling her as ugly as a dog and said she would take her out for a walk. I like my version better. "
"<|emo_disgust|> All that condescension to spell ""capitulate"" wrong. Shame."
"<|emo_sad|> For a second there I read the subreddit as ""furry and sad"". Pretty disappointed."
<|emo_anger|> hate to say it but nobody outside of saskatchewan has heard of [NAME] either
"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I think he was joking though. Like a cynical, sarcastic sorta comment"
"<|emo_joy|> Wow, y'all are heroes! "
<|emo_fear|> Reminds me of [NAME] from the documentary THIN who purged food through a feeding tube in her stomach. This sounds dangerous.
<|emo_sad|> Miss me with that
<|emo_anger|> Fuck this gif
<|emo_sad|> Truly a sad day when you can get fired just for having a *heated gaming moment*. We really do live in a society.
"<|emo_anger|> Look I'm not saying that I agree with them, theres no need to be an asshole"
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, Boy. You into phrenology too."
<|emo_anger|> #RejectingIslam because it is the *ideas* [RELIGION] promotes that turned me away from it.
"<|emo_disgust|> A small sample size can also be skewed the opposite direction, who’s to say the rape rate wouldn’t be much higher "
<|emo_joy|> Go to Happiest Hour before/after the game. Walking distance b/w AA center. It's a fun spot!
<|emo_sad|> Oh god another injury
<|emo_anger|> The level of denial the top boys reached was astonishing.
<|emo_joy|> Good to know everything is about average there. Leave it to H-Town to hold it down.

"<|emo_anger|> >While Austin is a great city that should embrace its first major pro franchise, What is this conformist nonsense?"
<|emo_anger|> It does infuriate me.
<|emo_anger|> So every interaction with a dumb or crazy person is news?
<|emo_joy|> Wow! You've put my relationship in words I couldn't think of.
"<|emo_disgust|> People feeling bad for [NAME], but he did this to himself teaming up with [NAME]. /s"
<|emo_fear|> Oh that’s terrifying
<|emo_anger|> You're going to be pissed.
<|emo_sad|> Sadly I think this is true & maybe this is the incentive adults need to get into action
<|emo_anger|> Fuck off.
<|emo_fear|> I remember writing on them was horrible. Slight delay which threw me off combined with the letters ending up looking like crap. Whiteboard was so much easier.
<|emo_sad|> Not a different issue especially when the majority of the people affected by these deaths are lower income
"<|emo_joy|> Dude, I'm happy for you. Keep going, you're doing great!"
<|emo_joy|> What's it matter where this came from? It fits every content guideline and we're enjoying it.
"<|emo_sad|> That's just sad and depressing. Was the race closing before she finished? Well, at least she did it."
"<|emo_disgust|> It was the only thing that changed. The weight gain, terrible acne, and moods... it was all nasty."
<|emo_sad|> The last two years of heart-breaking Saints playoff losses have *almost* made up for the horror of 2009.
<|emo_sad|> I hope you survive this. Losing a friend is a heavy loss
<|emo_sad|> The truly sad thing is she's getting burned to legitimize Russiagate. It's a shame she wasn't a legit whistleblower.
<|emo_anger|> Would u rather the food go into the bin or be eaten by birds?
<|emo_sad|> I love seeing satan... I mean saban upset

<|emo_fear|> I get abused on the daily fam ‍♀️‍♂️‍♂️‍
<|emo_sad|> The sad thing is his is still glitched. Just a couple days ago I died from [NAME] lightsaber about 5 seconds after someone else killed him.
<|emo_surprise|> I watched the bomb episode today! [NAME] reaction is totally something I would do/say.
<|emo_anger|> Just get him out of my sight I’m tired of losing and those who contribute to it
<|emo_joy|> I’m proud of you and I’m happy for you!
<|emo_anger|> It really sucks people are downvoting you just because they were worried about blowing themselves up just like us nova bomb users.
<|emo_disgust|> It feels oddly comforting and familiar that we suck at hockey again.
<|emo_anger|> All the centrist liberals in the comments are furious...
"<|emo_joy|> Oh like ""both of."" Gotcha. Good times"
<|emo_disgust|> I was the vegan in this story. I have since stopped my foolish ways and have since become a nuclear alpha mega Chad.
<|emo_disgust|> That's the main reason to play [NAME]? I hate it too.
"<|emo_sad|> I feel sorry for people that think Reddit (or even some random sub-reddit) is ""an international stage""."
"<|emo_joy|> glad she;'s back inside, tragic what shes doing to this dude and his family they r the ones picking up the tab. "
<|emo_sad|> I wanna die!
<|emo_sad|> My [NAME] accuses me of cheating all the time too when I’ve been nothing but loyal. Makes me wonder if she was cheating on me too...
<|emo_sad|> That would be really rough. However she is so incompetent I wouldn’t be surprised if she self immolates
"<|emo_joy|> This. We already have so much more OL talent. We need another WR and TE, but I'm kinda excited"
<|emo_anger|> What the fuck [NAME]! Are you easy to talk to? 29 years and you didn't see it coming?
<|emo_fear|> Thanks I was worried that I might die alone
<|emo_surprise|> I wondered the same thing. I never knew that this is a thing.
<|emo_joy|> An MRI would be infinitely more entertaining.
<|emo_anger|> Box up all his stuff and put it outside the door
"<|emo_surprise|> You forgot the to be sure >:). It's ""a surprise to be sure"". Back into the hole with you! "
<|emo_anger|> What the fuck is The Baffler? I can't even go there at work.
<|emo_sad|> “But [NAME] wants you to have kids!” [NAME] should have given me ovaries then lol
<|emo_anger|> Oh that’s right! It was mayonnaise for the lice. I don’t deserve those upvotes!
"<|emo_fear|> [NAME], that is so horrible. I’m so sorry for you and OP."
<|emo_surprise|> Wow. This is messed up.
<|emo_sad|> As a white man on the internet I'm outraged... because I had to laugh and laughing hurts right now : (
<|emo_anger|> No room. Get lost. I cc u!
<|emo_joy|> Everytime I get to hug someone.
<|emo_joy|> He might be happy to discover that he is the father of someone with superpowers! LOL
<|emo_anger|> food pranks really irk me 😔
<|emo_fear|> Think this is the first time I’ve ever disagreed with [NAME]. [NAME] at SF WCJ at PF sounds horrible
<|emo_anger|> i hate u...
<|emo_sad|> It kills me how much Oklahoma State and Iowa State are able to beat KU but [NAME] and [NAME] just couldn’t regularly get the job done.
"<|emo_fear|> Thanks for sharing. I'm afraid I will start to squint, this way. Not sure if it's the case. "
<|emo_surprise|> I was wondering the same thing
"<|emo_joy|> I read this place obsessively and didn't see it, so I'm enjoying it and upvoting it anyway"
"<|emo_sad|> The sad part is he actually looks pretty good with it, better than the design he has for most of the game."
<|emo_anger|> They’re all nothing but a pack of liers and should all be thrown in jail
<|emo_disgust|> I went to the avenues once. I was murdered twice in one day and they stole my grandma's jewellery from her grave in Minnesota!
"<|emo_joy|> Haha, then i am in... :)"
<|emo_fear|> You can't reason with some people. This person said people call 911 (emergency number) when they see his face.
<|emo_joy|> It's always nice to tell someone a pleasant story before they go to sleep.
<|emo_anger|> VUC YOU IDIOT!!!!
"<|emo_sad|> Withdrawal, psychic-shattering, and other activist groups, the principle is very sad."
<|emo_joy|> i remember that feeling.
<|emo_anger|> Better slap that car roof.
<|emo_sad|> I get it but it wasn't what i was talking about.
<|emo_anger|> My soul twin must be [NAME] because I’m terrified of water!
<|emo_disgust|> I'm using mine on the Consumer Cellular customers that come in mad at me because they have to set up an Apple Account to use their IPhone.
<|emo_disgust|> You dirty abo
"<|emo_sad|> Im reaching that age where some of my friends getting married, having kids, making 6figures and going to jail..."
<|emo_fear|> That's your justification? You're a terrible person. Correction: You're a terrible child. Get some help.
<|emo_surprise|> OMG. Indict this oligarch.
<|emo_surprise|> That’s! How you defeat a bear!!!!
"<|emo_fear|> [NAME] is a terrible defender, and as much as I like [NAME], I think it would be more beneficial to move his contract and sign another piece"
<|emo_disgust|> You are right but stick a cleanse on that bad boy and he's golden
<|emo_disgust|> Definitely fake. Looks like bad CGI in a movie.
<|emo_disgust|> Anyone else not like optics logo this year. The 2 greens look awful
<|emo_joy|> Ah yes I used to enjoy those. Before the dark times. Before the days of a FOX less Netflix.
"<|emo_sad|> Poor lady, she was the mother of a friend of my wife, and she went to school with my father in law :("

<|emo_joy|> I am very happy with play music. please tell me this is a lie
"<|emo_anger|> Feudalism is statism, dumbass."
<|emo_anger|> Really sucks that he's not going to retire a Sounder.
<|emo_disgust|> Actually that's the wrong guy. The guy you're thinking of is in prison now facing life. This guy sucks just as bad though..
"<|emo_sad|> This momentum control by the refs is killing us, and we're letting it"
"<|emo_sad|> Moose is pretty underwhelming tonight, I miss JV"
"<|emo_surprise|> The shocking thing about this all is that she seems to be British born. I'd expect this from immigrants, not those born in the UK."
<|emo_joy|> An afternoon of Big Cat vs Vol Twitter will be fun
<|emo_joy|> Lollll the mental gymnastics required not to be embarrassed by admitting you have to buy someone elses hair.... To put on your heads lol like what hhaaha
<|emo_anger|> Why so hateful. I feel sorry for you.
<|emo_anger|> Allow me to describe the shock and awe I experienced seeing this: **Fuck no why u do this?**
<|emo_joy|> You've described my parents who have been happily married for 36 years. You are good dude.
<|emo_anger|> Shut up cowpoke
<|emo_surprise|> I wouldn't be surprised if their confidence is so shot that they lose this control and lose 3-0
<|emo_fear|> Bless this woman. That honestly sounds horrific from every end. I hope her ex [NAME] has lived a horrendous life since perpetuating that disgusting act.
<|emo_sad|> The Dark Knight that didn't rise?? Home Alone.. forever?
<|emo_anger|> Say it louder for the Dwight’s in the lockers.
"<|emo_surprise|> Images you can hear, “oh my [NAME] laughter”"
"<|emo_joy|> I did physics and maths, now in astrophysics. It's fun (except for stars, those suck)."
<|emo_surprise|> I don’t think I’ve ever seen that many downvotes.
"<|emo_surprise|> The one coach I didn't want to lose, but with a new offense coming in, not a move i'm entirely shocked by. "
<|emo_surprise|> I'll be surprised if *Monty Python's Life of Brian* wasn't one of those.
<|emo_joy|> Bee happy! ' v')
<|emo_anger|> We didn't screw it up!
<|emo_sad|> I hate to be the bearer of bad news but she is more than likely dead and will never get to say goodbye
<|emo_surprise|> Had to stop and wonder what [NAME] has to do with this before I realize you wrote dumpster
<|emo_sad|> Makes it a lot less stressful tho. Regretting staying up this late tho
<|emo_surprise|> Because his reconnaissance is not unique in any way. Literally everyone who saw that movie thought that was surprising.
<|emo_disgust|> not funny enough for that
<|emo_joy|> So many nice things here. Good vibes. Enjoy your cake day and weekend. ✌
"<|emo_sad|> This is so sad. [NAME], play 'bitch lasagna'"
"<|emo_joy|> Watched it last night and as someone not generally into supernatural horror/thriller type stuff, I thought it was pretty damn enjoyable. "
<|emo_fear|> Humans are weird creatures
<|emo_joy|> State = good Anarcho-capitalism = bad Have fun getting taxed.
<|emo_sad|> This isn't a meme its a cry for help
<|emo_surprise|> Okay. The wall that he's mentioning. What wall would that be? ***on the border?? Oh my! Big surprise***
<|emo_anger|> Lots of internalized rage and mom guilt daily leading to a good shower cry once a week or so.
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah they paid for my dinner but still ugh
<|emo_joy|> Seeing this makes me happy. I hope this is true :)
<|emo_sad|> It's in case he suffers from amnesia and forgets his name.
<|emo_joy|> Luckily every elevator would be broken at all times.
<|emo_anger|> I have no idea what that even means nor why you're being such a massive prick
<|emo_joy|> What a journey.
<|emo_surprise|> Wonder if the balls are deflated... that worked well against the colts last time.
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah I probably would've started crying on the spot. Loud, sudden and especially shrill noises are extremely *""cringey""* and uncomfortable and stressful"
"<|emo_disgust|> But tbh, i dont think i am disgusting, but my feet still get smelly after a while "
<|emo_sad|> Because [NAME] had a foot injury that I think he sustained at practice for the second half of the year.
<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit. Thank you everyone. Thanks for the gold and silver :)
<|emo_surprise|> The miracle of life!
<|emo_anger|> i just don’t think we are aggressive 100% of the time
<|emo_sad|> I put so much thought into things that often I trigger myself unintentionally. I can be hurt before something has a chance to happen.
<|emo_sad|> I kiss the shade all dude. His username was trewdat. I miss that guy.
"<|emo_sad|> I’m sorry men, I have failed you. My rigidity was no match for the flaccid effort our boys showed tonight"
<|emo_anger|> If you had to think of a way to survive this how the hell would you. Damn
"<|emo_anger|> Damn you, [NAME]. I’m a woman and yours are bigger than mine. It’s not fair!"
<|emo_joy|> Pity because I enjoyed Max Normal.
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]
<|emo_sad|> That's a really good one too. I am pretty upset to learn how limited my vocabulary is
<|emo_anger|> I see a 14 day old reddit account angry at liberals.
<|emo_anger|> I will kill you all
<|emo_sad|> I’m sorry on behalf of all the idiot guys. They didn’t take my class. How Not to be Creepy 101.
<|emo_sad|> It's satirical but also almost truth. We're the fattest nation in Western Europe and that percentage is growing.
<|emo_surprise|> Can Dr. [NAME] confirm this? Edit: Doesn't matter. T H I C C D O N is actually zaddy af.
<|emo_sad|> The saddest thing is you will never understand how absolutely idiotic what you just said is.
<|emo_joy|> This joke hasn't really worked since the 11th Century. Even then it wasn't that funny.
<|emo_joy|> Yeah lets celebrate that only one guy (well maybe put dirk and [NAME] up with him) has come to play.
<|emo_anger|> What the fuck is The Baffler? I can't even go there at work.
"<|emo_anger|> The only ignorant person here is you, and the Pope who makes the same baseless claims as you."
<|emo_anger|> Gotta keep losing to make sure 5th is our worst case scenario
<|emo_joy|> They are all good right now. Pick the one that interests you and enjoy yourself.
<|emo_sad|> Or just get the fuck out and never look back.
<|emo_disgust|> That was straight up reckless
<|emo_anger|> I just can’t imagine he is as bad as that...it’s just hard to believe.
"<|emo_anger|> ""Feed the wars and fuck the poors"" is pretty much their policy."
<|emo_anger|> Fuck [NAME] pai
<|emo_sad|> Or perhaps we should look at the bigger problem: mental healthcare in the United States.
"<|emo_surprise|> You forgot [NAME] and [NAME] as [NAME] and [NAME] in the 2003 *Battlestar Galactica*, which was spectacular. "
"<|emo_disgust|> A ""Texas DUI"" sounds like a weird sex move. "
"<|emo_joy|> I have, and now that you mention it, I think that's what triggered my nostalgia. "
<|emo_surprise|> Did he just get fat? What caused him to fall off so much? It's amazing how quickly he flamed out.
<|emo_disgust|> *Ugh..* You are 23 and not married - leave.
<|emo_joy|> Lmao at this point she’ll probably deliver Teddy/Owen’s baby.
<|emo_disgust|> Worst radio ever.
"<|emo_surprise|> Weird how ive been ""attempted"" the same scam twice and im just a nobody.. Probably more or less amatur x'D"
<|emo_anger|> DELETE THAT SCREEN SHOT! NOW!!!
<|emo_surprise|> Quite surprised I wasn’t on there
"<|emo_disgust|> That looks absolutely awful. On the good side, whoever made it, can only get better."
<|emo_surprise|> I’m shocked that no one got whooshed by this comment
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] being the most manipulative person in the house was not something I expected
<|emo_sad|> Yea I'm poor :(
<|emo_surprise|> Using Vtrigger and Vskill buttons!? Oh My.
<|emo_disgust|> Normally drop n roll. In this case I would remove my clothes because I doubt rolling would help.
<|emo_anger|> I arbitrarily hate poo-lice Get OUT OF MY POO
"<|emo_joy|> Definitely going to fail without a doubt qualified to even own my dog, and I’m happy it’s a deload week."
<|emo_fear|> Those mindsets are extremely dangerous to our democracy.
<|emo_joy|> This thought brings me too much joy. The tantrum-throwing traitor has taken me to a very dark place.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is a MOTHERFUCKER
<|emo_joy|> It's MLK Day so we're offering our best deals on our Ford F250s!
<|emo_joy|> Is it really pasta :)
<|emo_fear|> There was a huge pervasive fear of nuclear war in the 80s among kids. I remember often waking up screaming from nuclear nightmares.
"<|emo_joy|> Yes!! Im always horny when I am with my BF, but right around ovulation, I am super horny!"
<|emo_anger|> we definitely don't need more people on this overcrowded planet.
"<|emo_fear|> No words, but a series of loud screams should explain this look fairly well"
<|emo_joy|> This is so sweet and it makes me so happy. But also so sad because I hate seeing families torn apart.
<|emo_joy|> Your work is amazing! Really like the Rugrat one. The melting style is so cool. Prices are very reasonable for the quality too
<|emo_joy|> And let us not forget the lord's privilege with a new bride. Ahhhh......the good old days.
<|emo_disgust|> Damn we got 7th grade conspiracy theorists in the world these days?!?!
<|emo_joy|> Two overtime games on championship Sunday? We are blessed as football fans. Too bad one game had to be between FYTB and FUKC
"<|emo_sad|> He will, I feel like it's Christmas Eve and I'm waiting for [NAME]."
"<|emo_anger|> But how the— what the— wait, why would—fuck it, I’m out. "
<|emo_disgust|> The weird eyes.
"<|emo_anger|> My brah, [NAME] on the line up! Fuck yeah!"
<|emo_sad|> Totally fair. I would be sad in your situation. :( I hope you find it. You're not wrong to want those things!
<|emo_joy|> GG haha 😉
"<|emo_disgust|> I have no idea what ""[NAME]"" is. These billion and one denominations are getting kind of ridiculous."
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME]? He's an absolute fool. If we need a coach to destroy our organization from top to bottom, he's the man."
<|emo_disgust|> I eat crayons I shit crayons
"<|emo_fear|> Oh no that's so awkward, I don't understand how people don't understand how weird things like that are! "
"<|emo_disgust|> Very hot take there, It'd be a shame if somebody... disrupted it. "
<|emo_disgust|> >testing teenagers for four mystery roles Oh good lord. This is going to be even worse.
"<|emo_disgust|> Absolutely true. Sit down to pee at home, the splashback is real. Especially if you're tall. "
<|emo_surprise|> Omg lmfao!!
"<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst Hellraiser reboot script I've read this month, and let me tell you, I've read a lot of them."
"<|emo_joy|> I enjoy it as well, there's dozens of us!"
"<|emo_surprise|> Such a strange signing, hopefully he wont cause to many problems in the dressing room"
"<|emo_sad|> As bad as the session was, I really do love your drow bard she sounds super fun to play with"
<|emo_anger|> Here in America too. Those counter protesting fascist get thrown in jail and pepper sprayed like animals. It makes no sense that this happens.
<|emo_sad|> Wow. Racists are really coming out of the woodwork to excuse and defend racism. How sad.
<|emo_joy|> Feeling good in the gayborhood.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is another worthless [NAME]. Utah is unbelievably stupid for voting for him.
<|emo_joy|> Hell yeah. Enjoy your new bachelor life son!
<|emo_surprise|> We still have this?!!!!!!!! What?!
<|emo_anger|> Don't be a [NAME] and misuse this term. We've reserved it for a movement of women who are done with sexual harassment.
<|emo_anger|> Who the hell has all these power tools but no hammer
<|emo_joy|> I'm so glad the Ontario government sold off that money pit. /s
<|emo_joy|> I feel like I've been transported back to 2011 when I look at the meme
<|emo_disgust|> I just saw a snot nosed brat eat a croissant on the subway and got crumbs all over and the snobby rude mom left like nothing happened .
<|emo_anger|> One dumbass who hasn’t watched Hereditary complaining about meaningless awards on the Internet means... eh. I lost my point. Go watch Hereditary
<|emo_sad|> Because what you're doing is disgusting and an insult to humanity.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh. You’re one of.... ^*those.*
"<|emo_anger|> Not gonna happen, pure delusion I *aggressively* call this ridiculous bluff"
<|emo_anger|> And religion isn't displayed on uber page. She saw a brown person and refused to interact with them solely based on race. She's a racist.
<|emo_joy|> My first Hawks jersey was #81. Praise be.
"<|emo_joy|> Yay, congratulations! :D"
<|emo_anger|> Removed and warned. R1
<|emo_fear|> Yeah I've noticed that. I probably give off Aspie traits to NTs but Aspie like traits bug me
<|emo_joy|> Cheers for the reply ;)
"<|emo_anger|> Shut up, don’t block the sanctimony train."
<|emo_anger|> Love the gif but I bloody hate these kinds of captions. It's as annoying and cringey as a fully grown adult doing baby-talk.
<|emo_sad|> Aquaria just lost her shit when the Cup Toss challenge went awry
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, wow, I didn't know my Dad had a Reddit account."
"<|emo_joy|> The third was fun with the [NAME] & [NAME] banter, but my vote still goes to S1 for being mostly faithful."
<|emo_disgust|> I legitimately want to brutally murder this person for saying that about us autistics
"<|emo_sad|> I understand what he was trying to say, but [NAME] it came out badly."
<|emo_sad|> I can feel that man's feelings and I'm crying
<|emo_joy|> Lol love it.
<|emo_surprise|> I like [NAME] but I disagree with him here. Then again it's not much surprise that a mega rich globetrotter that lives next to [NAME] would hold such views.
<|emo_disgust|> Looks like complete slop with 4 turds thrown on top. 🤢
<|emo_joy|> OMG! I need to make these. This looks so good!
<|emo_joy|> You're welcome
<|emo_disgust|> There is no assuming the worst. Its experience and taking things at face value.
<|emo_sad|> Even for an infidelity sub this is heavy. I hope you find peace somehow.
"<|emo_fear|> What, we are all gonna be corpses soon. Do I become that sooner?"
<|emo_joy|> Watched this while eating hash browns covered in ketchup. You SOB. NSFW lol.
<|emo_anger|> His definition of a grown man is someone who drinks irresponsibly and then beats people up. GET OUT.
<|emo_sad|> It must be really sad and lonely under your bridge troll.
<|emo_sad|> They could have prepared you better. I'm so sorry. I wanna give you a hug and tell you it's okay.
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] Almighty. This may be the most empathetic and compassionate reddit thread I've ever seen! Who ever said drunks were mean? Terrible stereotype.
<|emo_disgust|> Healthier and more disgusting.
<|emo_sad|> So happy for [NAME]. So sad he's not here. Imagine this team with [NAME] instead of [NAME]. Ugh.
<|emo_disgust|> You're not going to drastically improve in a day to where itll have any significance in a game hours from the postb
"<|emo_joy|> Yeah. Sure.... Why don’t you just let us have some fun, wet towel person."
<|emo_sad|> *[NAME] making [NAME] even more sad.*
<|emo_surprise|> Between this and the headline it makes me wonder how he fits his ego through most doorways.
<|emo_fear|> Why is it that young girls seem to idolise serial killers? I had a friend like this and never understood the attraction. It's scary
<|emo_joy|> Really glad they decided to show us that /s
<|emo_fear|> I would see a doctor asap and get to a psychiatrist. Hallucinations of any kind are worrisome.
<|emo_anger|> Fuck [NAME] for continuing to give her a platform.
<|emo_disgust|> I gagged at unwashed zebra hoodie.
<|emo_anger|> If you don't understand that question then you be receptive to any of my ideas.
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how [NAME] prepares his food.
<|emo_surprise|> I thought this allegation was squashed when it came out. I was surprised to see it still making headlines. Poor guy.
<|emo_anger|> How the fuck is that not ticketable.
"<|emo_surprise|> He was skinnu guy all his life, untill that transformation."
"<|emo_surprise|> Considering you are also a child, I can't say I'm surprised by your edgy hot take."
<|emo_joy|> Enjoy it! You have a good one for your first!
<|emo_anger|> Expert peep fan here! I’m not gonna attack or defend I just wanna say that kids a little Bitch
"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, this seems weird to me, too."
"<|emo_anger|> Again nothing, you are the one obsessing over that term, he literally says he puts girls on a pedestal. "
"<|emo_surprise|> I’m really late here, but I’m surprised I haven’t seen anyone bring up the possibility of them wanting to eat you."
<|emo_sad|> >he definitely doesn't value my pleasure this is very sad
<|emo_surprise|> jeeez i've never seen a scorpion so bad it actually flipped the person up right
<|emo_joy|> You beat me to this joke.
<|emo_anger|> Fuck this team
<|emo_anger|> He must hate that gym as much as everyone else does.
"<|emo_anger|> Ah, so you're the reason people hate aspies. "
<|emo_anger|> You're an idiot
<|emo_surprise|> OP please message a local woman's refuge as soon as you are able. They will be able to offer you advice in a supportive environment.
"<|emo_sad|> The lying little slag. If you're squatting properly, turning your neck shouldn't be comfortable enough to consider"
<|emo_surprise|> I’ve always wondered why they play at ear splitting volume instead of one where you can enjoy the music.....
<|emo_surprise|> Wow this team has no clue what to do against this right now. There has to be 15 turnovers already.
<|emo_surprise|> how'd you get into my brain???
<|emo_fear|> Something extremely fishy is going on here with this story.
<|emo_surprise|> Oohhh so you go to school on a military base? Is your mom or dad in the military or both?
"<|emo_sad|> 1-2-3-4 I declare a thumb war! Dangit [NAME], you win again! Ok you get to stab me again :("
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah, I do. I'm just pretty sure that that will fuck my heart eventually. But I'll worry about that later."
"<|emo_surprise|> Astounding. People died. And the church's response is ""Thank [NAME] that the caravan moves on!"""
"<|emo_surprise|> Haha, why are you still thinking about that? That's super weird."
"<|emo_fear|> Oh, goodness!"
<|emo_joy|> Haha I’ll try and avoid it. Nowhere currently on my list is in Alabama
<|emo_joy|> A video that makes me happy
"<|emo_fear|> [NAME] didn’t just fight dogs, he, personally, tortured them too. He isn’t a dog fighter, he is a sociopath."
<|emo_joy|> > Good thing I know who controls the HOA. . . . the [NAME]?
<|emo_sad|> I feel bad for these guys. I'd like to be able to help ex-mos in trouble.
<|emo_disgust|> well she went to prison for **armed robbery and kidnapping** so after learning this i could hardly give a shit about her
<|emo_anger|> Stop saying generic hating sentences!
<|emo_surprise|> Right. He didn't even say a word. I feel like I've seen this before tho.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow. So I figure you two are both at least considerably older than me (24) and ...wow his response
<|emo_joy|> I enjoy that general area. Sections 203-205 are good sections pricewide and view wise
<|emo_joy|> *We're allll in this together~*
"<|emo_sad|> I might be alone here, but it was probably Blame Game. I don't think I heard a rap song with that much emotional intensity before."
<|emo_joy|> To each their own. I enjoy it for what it is
<|emo_surprise|> It could be bait and switch... Which would be a surprise
<|emo_disgust|> I knew this was stupid when the shittastic music came on.
"<|emo_surprise|> Exactly! It amazes me how many people dont communicate with each other. Talk about it, see what they say. Discuss. Come to a conclusion."
<|emo_surprise|> Mommy bad man!!!
"<|emo_joy|> Already have one of those, mate :) just looking for a good replacement so I can continue using my [NAME]"
"<|emo_fear|> The bruised banana kit is only 👌aesthetic👌 cause it's a meme, I swear if the kit belonged to Huddersfield or something people would think it looked ghastly"
<|emo_sad|> He is holding you hostage. Sad state of affairs.
"<|emo_sad|> 60 young men standing around... ""Look out that old native dude is coming right at us... DEFENSIVE POSITIONS SHIELDS UP!"""
"<|emo_anger|> Hi furious, I'm dad!"
<|emo_surprise|> My man!
"<|emo_sad|> I like to believe he faked his own death, so he can enjoy his many Bitcoin coins and wealth. "
<|emo_anger|> Stop using your corporate jargon around here!
"<|emo_joy|> Congrats, proud of you ! Hopefully I can follow your lead and get myself out of a similar situation "
"<|emo_joy|> I'm sure you're alright, [NAME]. xD"
"<|emo_anger|> Don't even bother with him lol. He's a mindless sexist, doesn't believe facts at all lmao"
<|emo_joy|> Another place Canada wins. That is crazy. There is basically no oversight on alternative medicine down here. Caveat emptor I guess.
<|emo_sad|> The worst is when those moments pop up randomly. Especially when you’re feeling happy and then a mistake you did back in 2005 comes creeping up.
<|emo_sad|> I tell them my wife died in a car accident 10 years ago and I couldn’t fall in love again. I’ve never been married.
"<|emo_joy|> I'd be so upset about this, I hope you got to enjoy it thoroughly :)"
"<|emo_disgust|> Wow two shitty reactions out of order, judging by the way [NAME] looks at you the sweetest."
<|emo_sad|> If your dog is an arctic breed they will go crazy with joy and be sad that you don’t share in their happiness for the bitter cold.
<|emo_sad|> Oh poor guy. That’s so sad. I can see why she is an ex friend.
<|emo_surprise|> What a gift!
"<|emo_anger|> Nah, according to OPs limited post history, he's a pedophile. "
"<|emo_sad|> That's just sad and depressing. Was the race closing before she finished? Well, at least she did it."
<|emo_sad|> This is so bad and I really don't get that politicians or party's like ovld don't realise this. Why block actually defends this.
"<|emo_surprise|> Unbelievable that we didn’t sign him Also, we could’ve potentially signed [NAME] the window we signed [NAME]. Kill me."
<|emo_anger|> i hate that it's over an interstate bridge so people traveling from the west from other states have to look at it edit* because it's fucking corny
<|emo_surprise|> Seriously? I couldn't even remember the dude's name until about halfway through the season honestly.
<|emo_fear|> Please don't promote your channel
<|emo_anger|> I am but me and my SO live separate lives.
"<|emo_joy|> I'm 5'6"" and three quarters haha. Have hair though."
<|emo_anger|> What the actual hell?
<|emo_joy|> My girl [NAME]. Love that our names are the same bless
<|emo_joy|> because it's fun
<|emo_disgust|> Guy looks like he's taking a nasty deuce.
<|emo_anger|> well wj=h [NAME] allows evil and why he burns us..free will cant tmake sese from a god that KNOWS what will happpen
<|emo_sad|> a guy named [NAME] had a nightmare of [NAME] getting shot at a live performance.
<|emo_surprise|> I think they’re gonna keep her a surprise.
"<|emo_fear|> That woman gave me nightmares as a child. Also, you probably know this but she also plays [NAME] aunt in the third movie!"
<|emo_surprise|> It's almost like people live in this bubble where there are only magatards and hillshills. No inbetween. Only hyperpolarization.
<|emo_anger|> You’d think the higher ups would look at how much these law suits are costing and tell their boys and girls to tone it the fuck down.
<|emo_joy|> Nothing. I am much happier off all meds. Been off of meds for 2 years.
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME], this is an absolute lie. "
"<|emo_joy|> Me too! And he was so happy to get that out of her back, he seems like he really cares."
"<|emo_anger|> Nah, you’re pretty fucked given the amount of weed you smoke and the fact you’re planning on finishing your 1.5 grams before the test."
<|emo_surprise|> Haven't printed a retraction in twenty years!
<|emo_joy|> And we'll be surrounded by friends
<|emo_joy|> Congrats on catching up to much of the developed world.
<|emo_disgust|> That is odd.
<|emo_sad|> Watched this while eating hash browns covered in ketchup. You SOB. NSFW lol.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I didn’t know their website was owned by Sinclair. I thought that was just channel 2.
"<|emo_disgust|> ""Even if that were true, do you think it justifies not trying at all?"""
"<|emo_disgust|> No. There's a fair amount of nudity, violence and foul language. "
"<|emo_surprise|> I chose a name without my parents. Then when I told them the name, they said that's the name they had picked out if I was afab"
<|emo_joy|> You seem fun
"<|emo_disgust|> We were by far the better team - [NAME] had no chance on any of the goals. Bad mistakes by [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME]"
<|emo_fear|> Ah. That’s where I left it. Now where are the keys
"<|emo_anger|> There. Are. No. Moderate. Republicans. Repeat this, nonstop, everytime she is mentioned. She is an extremist who pretends to be moderate."
<|emo_sad|> No. Going to a competitive high school was harder and more stressful than all my adult endeavors combined.
<|emo_sad|> Oh god another injury
"<|emo_joy|> We're are going on a trip, in our favorite rocket ship"
"<|emo_anger|> ""[NAME]!"" *screeched the two apprentices as they tried to prove their worth to the the one who shall not be named*"
<|emo_fear|> We'll worry about it tomorrow
<|emo_sad|> Yea I'm poor :(
<|emo_sad|> OMG are you serious? Do you know what episode? That's horrendous! I'm really disappointed in [NAME] on that one.
<|emo_sad|> These leaks are actually very credible. It's sad that you guys let Hate and anger blind you from enjoying the experience.
"<|emo_anger|> Yeah I know what you meant. Fuck the police, most of them are vile pieces of shit, they deserve every kick in the back they get."
<|emo_joy|> I've always wondered how cases where an individual gets a 7 or 8 figure sum issued against them work in practice
"<|emo_sad|> as a Ducks fan, this thread makes me sad..."
<|emo_sad|> Sorry don’t follow you.
<|emo_joy|> I hope it heals well! I will bring out the Oww Mah Layg dancers to encourage healing and positive energy to help you and cheer you on! 🎶💃Oww💃Mah💃Layg💃🎶
<|emo_sad|> That was painful to read.
<|emo_sad|> Makes it even weirder that she now hates America
<|emo_anger|> whah we got a badass over here xD
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, your posting history is a real... interesting ride."
"<|emo_anger|> yeah, fuck [NAME]"
<|emo_surprise|> I loved this costume and wasn’t even aware of the amount of hate it had until recently
<|emo_joy|> Cool. Glad I'm not the only one who found it weird.
<|emo_anger|> No! Mom said it was MY turn!!!!
"<|emo_anger|> Fuck the White House, fuck McDonald’s and fuck this post."
"<|emo_sad|> Sadly, I don't have insurance so unless I'm bleeding out I won't be getting medical help."
<|emo_joy|> We could cure child cancer and pictures like this would still make me happier
"<|emo_sad|> I was pleasantly surprised that I couldn’t think of anything I broke at my last retail job but... you’re right, that was it"
<|emo_anger|> The stupid is real
<|emo_surprise|> >the women's march chairs are so left wing they took a picture with LF.
"<|emo_joy|> It’s my favorite Saturday movie, never gets boring"
<|emo_disgust|> He told you that he hates your friends because they don't beat you up? That is so disgusting!
<|emo_sad|> I've never woken up to a fan around my throat.
<|emo_sad|> I live in those unfortunately
<|emo_surprise|> Hey I’m going to eli today! Unfortunately for a funeral but hello stranger :)
<|emo_sad|> Oh that’s so sad that she thinks anyone cares about her opinion
<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit this speaks to me.
<|emo_sad|> Because it's too late and you're hungry 😅
<|emo_surprise|> Is that a little poot at :09?
<|emo_disgust|> Wow. I could have gone my entire life without witnessing this limpdicked haemorrhoid rank the severity of sexual assault based on who the victim is.
<|emo_anger|> Me but with boobs. When will be able to trade body parts [NAME]
<|emo_surprise|> Because [NAME] want to control you!
<|emo_surprise|> It's refreshing to not see comments with anti-china sentiments here every once in a while.
<|emo_surprise|> Can’t believe they actually got married. What a joke
<|emo_sad|> I'm crying. Their faces 😂🤣😂
<|emo_joy|> I laughed in my beard.
<|emo_joy|> She's a piece of work. I'm glad you're reporting your account issues.
"<|emo_sad|> 2018, more disappointment. "
<|emo_joy|> Gonna be a much better game than the last one. So glad you guys are coming to carver
<|emo_joy|> I’ve tried a few times on mobile and it never works for some reason. Edit: just logged on at work and fixed it. Feels good
<|emo_disgust|> Too greasy.
<|emo_fear|> This is why I’m afraid to fly.
<|emo_fear|> I'm working on it. But there is always the fear lurking around....
<|emo_anger|> I’m definitely leaving him. I have a 0 tolerance for cheating and won’t be staying for it to happen again
<|emo_joy|> Lol ik it's just I wanted people to figure it out and not the bot to ruin it.
<|emo_joy|> Can’t wait to go to the Kings game. Especially if they bring this level of fire.
"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, that's dark"
"<|emo_disgust|> People have gotten shot with legal means while breaking into someone's home, sued the home owner and won. "
<|emo_anger|> Conservatives now hate dancing... anybody surprised?
"<|emo_fear|> Yeah, I’m going to do my best to avoid a fight. She’d probably kill me. "
"<|emo_fear|> Turn off your phone, computer or even the internet. It is scary to do but just for now when the urges hits."
<|emo_joy|> I think the book portrayal is more ambiguous than you say. I like that the show leans into one interpretation of her character instead of keeping it vague.
"<|emo_disgust|> Just gonna be mean here, those are all hideous :("
"<|emo_sad|> If I start shoving food into my face as I enjoy everyone here, dis becomes a bery bery unhealthly situation. "
<|emo_joy|> The only happy ending I enjoyed on this sub. Good job.
<|emo_fear|> Lol always a creepy mike
<|emo_surprise|> How is she at all mobile at that weight? Bones are incredible things!
<|emo_disgust|> I'm gonna say that I hate Randazzo's because of their terrible icing. Haydel's is decent and ships.
<|emo_disgust|> No. It’s creepy.
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how it's still tagged questionable...
<|emo_sad|> Same. Right after I replaced the screen. So now I have a cracked phone
<|emo_anger|> 700 euros per week for 16 hour days 6 -7 days a week is shite and well below minimum wage if you work it out per hour.
<|emo_anger|> Ya i hate to talk bad about don’t but they should get the sticks out of their butts and make smarter decisions for their community
<|emo_fear|> Same. I can’t even imagine it
"<|emo_fear|> I'd bet that this falls under spamming and therefor I'll get banned soon :/ (please dont, I love this sub)"
<|emo_surprise|> Wow! That takes guts! I’m so squeamish that I can hardly stand getting a shot 😂
"<|emo_fear|> NOLA is a terrible place to live, ran by democrats forever and this is the result. "
<|emo_disgust|> So you defend an evil murdering dictator and pedal conspiracy theories and whataboutism. Grow up.
<|emo_sad|> I'm still so sad we never got to see [NAME] witnessing his miracle baby's first steps. ☹️
"<|emo_anger|> My [NAME] says he hates everything right now, too. He's caught himself a few times from saying he hates me. "
<|emo_anger|> You shouldn't force someone to come out you know. Now look at what you did! You killed [NAME]! You bastard!
<|emo_joy|> Yeah it was a fun game. :D
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME], just when I'd forgotten about that..."
<|emo_anger|> Take the child from them! Wtf? Theyre so dumb. You always secure the kids seat!
"<|emo_surprise|> wow, there's no way [NAME] should 'er scored that"
<|emo_fear|> Yeah! Despite being from the east coast I've never been in the car when it's hailing so it was a full on argument. Thank you!
<|emo_disgust|> Bears suck!
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah it sort of sucks now.
<|emo_joy|> Im so glad I grew up killing infants at hospitals instead of being on my nokia
<|emo_joy|> No I’m happy to spend big on myself. I’m not happy to spend my money on layabout benefits claimants.
<|emo_disgust|> That's not true. There are people that genuinely want to cause harm to people and don't care about reactions.
"<|emo_surprise|> This is a person who has clearly danced a lot, I wonder what happened "
<|emo_surprise|> Lol they’re in for a big surprise.. does anyone know how TIMs will actually age?
<|emo_anger|> And if that's the case then there is no helping him. It sucks that those people can't be helped
<|emo_disgust|> All I'm seeing here is that you commited a brutal murder.
"<|emo_disgust|> Disgusting, but fascinating."
<|emo_fear|> He was afraid of flying
"<|emo_sad|> When your dog dies, you will realize how absurd this statement is."
<|emo_sad|> Yeah and I love my dog and I'd miss my dad.
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] ! Glad that we helped you.
<|emo_joy|> Oh boy you’re in for a treat. Make sure you visit Austin if you move
<|emo_disgust|> Now she’s going to find corn in her panties for the foreseeable future. Poor planning! Tehe...creamed corn....
"<|emo_joy|> Thank you, I thought the plane in the picture was cool too. I am. One of the best pictures I’ve taken with my phone."
<|emo_sad|> ☠️ I felt his pain!!!☠️ R.I.P. furry giblets!!!!☹️
"<|emo_anger|> Wah Mum other people call me on my bullshit and I can't ban them , Go out side son."
<|emo_disgust|> That’s so incredibly rude and inaccurate. You can’t actually believe that.
<|emo_sad|> Sad because you don't get any women?
<|emo_disgust|> In fact the South side of Chicago is the baddest part of town
<|emo_anger|> Are you serious? Open up a fucking history book
<|emo_sad|> I'm so broke that I'd take if you're still looking. I'm a guy though.
<|emo_sad|> Stop crying.
<|emo_surprise|> I'll be surprised if *Monty Python's Life of Brian* wasn't one of those.
<|emo_sad|> you're going to relapse in two years because you have an illness that makes you use excessive amounts of things to cope with emotions..
<|emo_sad|> Damn this guy just had a bad day!
<|emo_surprise|> WOW HOLY SHIT
"<|emo_anger|> The middle was an analogy. No one here condones terrorism, as that's attacks on civilians, Destruction of financial buildings isn't that. "
<|emo_anger|> Cus the left doesn't give a shit about people who fought for the USA!
"<|emo_anger|> I can relate, and I blame sexual tension because of it."
<|emo_sad|> When that intro drops I get so into it and scare my cat
<|emo_disgust|> So. Damn. Greasy.
"<|emo_fear|> If you are really so dead set against shoveling sidewalks, perhaps you should move to a warmer climate. "
"<|emo_joy|> Cheers, brother. What are you doing to meet women? "
"<|emo_anger|> He is just a kid, calm down and/or direct your anger elsewhere."
<|emo_anger|> looks like got damn shoe leather.
<|emo_joy|> What's up with all the gloating.
"<|emo_disgust|> If an addict gets clean of booze/drugs, you congratulate them! What a horrible crabbycrab to try to shut down someone who got their addiction under control."
<|emo_joy|> I’m excited!
<|emo_surprise|> This is brilliant.
<|emo_surprise|> I am shocked they don’t have a vanity plate that reads “Beer Cheez”
<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry. That's awful
<|emo_anger|> It only gets worse kiddo. Someone call [NAME] and get this girl an upgrade.
"<|emo_sad|> ""Being asked not to rape is oppressing me"""
<|emo_anger|> The lack of teabags is the only emergency here. You thwarted an attack on your child.
<|emo_joy|> I have little to no anxiety and it really helps me when i have to take a test.
<|emo_sad|> I live in those unfortunately
"<|emo_disgust|> Only when they have dirt underneath them, now that’s disgusting."
<|emo_sad|> FYI killing yourself is god-tier lib ownage
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] expunged my paraphernalia without consent and I called the **LAW TIGERS** to sue him for damages.
<|emo_disgust|> Looks like someone's got a bad case of the zoomies.
"<|emo_surprise|> Me, too. Was shocked to say the least."
<|emo_surprise|> And you didn't read the filler did you?
"<|emo_anger|> I dont know much russian, but all I heard was ""Oohhh fuck. Shit."" (Rocket launches and explodes) ""......shit."""
<|emo_sad|> So I should definitely give up on real life is what you are trying to say huh? :(
"<|emo_anger|> You’ve really added to the conversation, thank you. Stop reposting news articles for karma it makes you look fucking pathetic."
<|emo_surprise|> wow even the buildings on the poster haven't loaded in
<|emo_sad|> Unfortunately there are also far less/weaker unions now too
"<|emo_joy|> hello there, i sent some hugs your way. ^.^"
<|emo_surprise|> So many? I’d be amazed if it was more than 0.1% of active players at any time
<|emo_surprise|> Wouldn’t be shocked for a lot of those guys to follow him to TB.
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] looked just as bad as [NAME].
"<|emo_disgust|> huh. if there’s no pain, you’re fine. maybe just use spray on like axe or something to detour the smell "
"<|emo_sad|> Sure, sorry for late response."
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] I hate Twitter
<|emo_fear|> USC had 4 guys commit 2 fouls in the first half. This might become a war of attrition.
<|emo_surprise|> Surprisingly it wasn’t a [NAME]
<|emo_anger|> Go away [NAME]....
<|emo_joy|> Thoroughly entertaining.
"<|emo_fear|> Not dislexia, the recent news about kashoggi has for the most part conditioned us to expect horrifying g news where Saudi nationals in foreign countries are concerned"
"<|emo_anger|> Also, [NAME] growl/yelling/screaming at [NAME] in the sumo suit on beach day. "
"<|emo_anger|> Yeah, what do you know about her? Her Wikipedia page is pretty barren."
<|emo_joy|> Oh. Oh shit. It's you. Sorry you had to see this glorious trainwreck.
<|emo_disgust|> That would be abused so hard.
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what he's listening to...
<|emo_joy|> You're championing the removal of some threads while complaining about the removal of threads...
<|emo_joy|> Gotta love trailing for 59+ minutes
"<|emo_anger|> I’m seeing ‘bad gateway’, not the maintenance page. "
<|emo_surprise|> WHAT you guys get this show on Netflix? We certainly do not get it in Canada what is this bullshit
<|emo_anger|> Lol dont mess with [NAME]!
<|emo_joy|> It's good to know that I'm not the only one lol
<|emo_joy|> Glad to hear. It seems like a very hopeful sign. 👍
<|emo_joy|> Impressive to have such foresight.
<|emo_sad|> You’re not going to convince anyone else either if you refuse to back up any of your claims.
"<|emo_sad|> If we don’t get [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], or [NAME]..... I’ll be so sad "
<|emo_sad|> Done and done in the memory of [NAME]. I am sorry for your loss.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] fucking [NAME] please no
<|emo_fear|> that scared me
<|emo_sad|> I’m so sorry 🤪
"<|emo_disgust|> I'm more than sure we [NAME] lovers feel the same way, her outfits are awful"
<|emo_sad|> I’m so sorry for your loss. It’s the smallest things that take up the biggest part of our hearts.
<|emo_disgust|> Not admitting you like something because some of the fan base sucks is pretty pathetic.
"<|emo_sad|> Did the Benghazi investigation lead to more than a dozen people thrown in jail, cause this investigation has and it's not even over. "
<|emo_sad|> i miss this show so much
"<|emo_sad|> Don't worry, with a lifestyle that requires them to have a new hip before the age of 20 they won't be making it much further."
<|emo_surprise|> Pull your fucking pants up oh my god
<|emo_surprise|> Playing the golden oldies eh?
<|emo_joy|> And they lived happily ever after.
<|emo_joy|> You sound like my gf. I'm so lucky to have her in my life.
"<|emo_fear|> Correct. I still play NHL Faceoff 98 and I always turn that rule off, because it's terrible."
<|emo_anger|> That woman is simultaneously very evil and using her evil to make others regret doing evil things.
<|emo_disgust|> Brooklyn-Boston playoffs would be the most toxic thing of all time. Only Sixers-Cs would be worse
"<|emo_anger|> I'm from Buenos Aires, and I say kill 'em all!"
<|emo_disgust|> You forgot >Having a $1500 debt on LES due to Finance fucking up
<|emo_surprise|> Unbelievable! Here. Have your iPad back. Not interested in being treated like a criminal. I’ll write home with pen and paper
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah, sorry, I was on the mobile site, and wasn't able to delete it."
<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid of having a sit down with them amd not being heard. But I might have to for my safety.
<|emo_sad|> I'm so jealous. I'm in NYC for a year and the lack of King Cake is giving me actual depression.
<|emo_anger|> (Stupid) * (how many times you think you can pull it off without getting caught )
<|emo_surprise|> I live in Northern Scandinavia now and one of the biggest culture shocks to my American brain was the groups of very young kids just roaming the neighborhood.
<|emo_disgust|> dae [NAME] IS MOMMY FUCK MY ASS WITH A BACKHOE MOTHER YES GAWD *tongue pop* WHAT A TALENTED ACTRESS BUT ALSO PARENTAL FIGURE
<|emo_sad|> Middle school. Puberty was rough for most of us. I was a victim and a perpetrator of a lot of stupid behavior in middle school.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow damn this some good words
<|emo_surprise|> Very surprised he didn't frog leap at the guy the close the distance
"<|emo_anger|> The 100,000 who died in the Tokyo bombing during WWII weren't killed by [NAME], it was just the passive spreading of fire. Fuck off, genocide apologist. "
<|emo_joy|> Aww that makes me happy!
<|emo_sad|> This is scary and so very sad. Eleven??? A baby! I was still building forts. I weep for this child.
<|emo_joy|> i can change mood for no reason on seconds. Im happy ish. To sad or frustrated to anger and rage and not always in that order.
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, it was THAT episode?"
"<|emo_anger|> SHE. IS. THE. FUCKING. WORST. P.S. You’re not fat, you just need a stylist. 🙄"
<|emo_sad|> That 0.75 is not for the same job. It's looking at the totality of female salary vs male salary.
"<|emo_disgust|> I was reading up last night and it's a mixed bag. Exercise can help with the depressive episodes, but it can make the manic episodes worse."
<|emo_joy|> Lol alright dude. Nice chat.
<|emo_sad|> I’m sorry to hear this. Live a hell of a life for your mate
"<|emo_anger|> Thanks, I hate it. They're out now though."
"<|emo_joy|> Smh. Can y’all stop being so hot? For real though congrats, you two look so happy together!"

<|emo_joy|> This should be of interest to you. -
"<|emo_sad|> I didn’t notice till the replay and honestly, I screamed"
"<|emo_joy|> My boyfriend is so much like your husband. I’m so happy for you to have him, he sounds wonderful. "
<|emo_anger|> 🤷🏻‍♀️ As a wise man once said: he was a bastard in life thus a bastard in death 
<|emo_sad|> But all this does is hurt the average person not the right way to raise money.
"<|emo_disgust|> Because at best, you’re a racist and an apologist for at least a wanna-be dictator and his supporters "
<|emo_fear|> Why does everyone keep assuming that we’ll suddenly sign big name FA’s? This is a terrible idea.

<|emo_joy|> Glad you had fun! Your gf sounds like a keeper!
<|emo_anger|> You are BOTH awful people.
<|emo_joy|> But that sounds yummy.
<|emo_surprise|> It surprises me Turkey doesn't intervene even there. I would presume that at least OB-ES areas are off limits and Turkey would intervene if HTS entered them.
<|emo_surprise|> With punctuation like that I'm surprised you're not from Jordanhill
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah, I might have used the wrong word."
"<|emo_disgust|> I was Isla Vista, beautiful and terrible place"

<|emo_joy|> She’s lovely! Cheers to your lives together
"<|emo_disgust|> Been there, done that. Not the best idea unfortunately. Especially if it doesn't work. Gets awkward "
"<|emo_sad|> To see how much he really cares, what he will do, it usually backfires on me though :("
<|emo_disgust|> Fuck the rangers
"<|emo_joy|> Happy? Not really, but glad we can come to a conclusion to my offhand semi in jest reply."
<|emo_surprise|> I’m wondering the same; something seems weird about that interpretation of the law
<|emo_joy|> Shared misery *always* makes me feel better :D
<|emo_sad|> Please. I can’t even with these comments.
<|emo_anger|> This looks like an obvious joke to me. Most of you are getting baited.
<|emo_fear|> To make her feel threatened
"<|emo_anger|> The last thing I want on my team are former Eagles players. Fuck that team, the organization, and the shitty fanbase "
<|emo_anger|> Nooooooooo I was a student staff member at the WCC and this makes me so sad and angryyyyy
"<|emo_sad|> Both [NAME] and [NAME] were broken up, so it wasnt cheating."

<|emo_anger|> He's an angry elf
<|emo_sad|> Extremely painful to watch
<|emo_fear|> “Got caught talking about meditation” Sounds terrible I am so sorry you had to go through that kind of thought policing.

<|emo_sad|> Sending love. I am so sorry you are going through this
<|emo_surprise|> assault? molest just has a connotation of someone being under the influence or without proper faculties
<|emo_sad|> That hurt too much to watch twice.
<|emo_fear|> Ok that was a rude way to send him off. Can I have hot doctors again
<|emo_anger|> As The Pot Bro's always say. When the Cops ask you questions. Shut the fuck up.
"<|emo_joy|> That's hilarious, and a much better way to play doctor than some of the kids I've heard of! :)"
<|emo_surprise|> This is horrifying
<|emo_sad|> I really hope no one actually thought [NAME] would be our coach for next season.
<|emo_anger|> Grow up.

"<|emo_anger|> Lore wise, this makes sense and I hate/love it with the same energy "
<|emo_anger|> I can't wait to find out why this is inaccurate and I should hate the person who made this post and shower them with downvotes.
<|emo_disgust|> I think you have a terrible opinion. Now that we agree on something though this could be the start of a beautiful friendship!
"<|emo_joy|> It's gonna be the next ""live, laugh, love"" with everyone running around talking about if things ""spark joy"""
"<|emo_sad|> This is seriously disturbing. Even more disturbing, is that we aren’t doing anything about this, and it’s going to expand. Watch. "

<|emo_joy|> That's why I'm glad they got [NAME].

<|emo_anger|> That is not a law. It's a freaking poem that someone decided to write.
<|emo_anger|> The bitch doesnt need drag race (bc shes amazing) but im still sad.
<|emo_surprise|> Maybe ask some neighbours if there have been any strange or noteworthy comings and goings during the day.
"<|emo_fear|> Don’t worry, he’s more afraid of you than you are of him. Just act tough, it’ll work...maybe..."
<|emo_joy|> Lol! I’m glad you feel lucky because you are! Could you imagine dealing with the continuous flipping back and forth between desire and guilt? 😬

<|emo_disgust|> This comment is complete garbage.
<|emo_sad|> I just had a panic attack!

<|emo_surprise|> I like surprises.
"<|emo_anger|> Guys, even worse: He *paid* someone to set it up. Wow. "
"<|emo_surprise|> Considering that the majority of people who play poker still open limp, I'm surprised these posts aren't more common."
"<|emo_anger|> Ahhh, the old ""if you don't vote the way I do, you're a big dumb idiot"" gambit. "
"<|emo_anger|> Keeping his mouth shut? After cheerleading for the dictatorship, that's the least the scumbag can do."

<|emo_fear|> General population are scared of press
<|emo_anger|> £20 per child?! That is ridiculous! You can’t buy much of anything for that! I am furious on your behalf!!
<|emo_sad|> I'm currently playing a child character and noone at the table has a problem with my 91 year old elf.
<|emo_surprise|> Omg so short but such a bop! I’m so excited for her album
<|emo_anger|> Which suggests nothing in itself. The same mods you claim are abusive are probably as hyperbolic about the racism issue as you are.
"<|emo_joy|> Oh goodness, that show shaped my sense of humor. I loved it so much."
<|emo_joy|> I love flying out of Midway because I feel like I have never waited more than 10 minutes for security. I love the lines at Midway.
"<|emo_joy|> Agree 100% I guess I'm just happy to see anyone, even total scumbags, willing to criticize dear leader. "
<|emo_joy|> That's just a tad frosty. I'm ready to ice skate to work on thursday amsterdam style.
<|emo_joy|> Well she’s still kind of awful but she’s hilarious. Definitely a huge improvement. I could barely watch her!!
<|emo_surprise|> OMG - you're my freakin' hero. And your last post had me absolutely weeping with laughter.
"<|emo_sad|> I am sorry that you are experiencing such deep suffering and such pain. You matter in this world, and we would all be diminished without you."
"<|emo_disgust|> I do not see how that is disgusting. She's cleaning her self and had a discharge, so what? "
<|emo_sad|> 😂 Poor kitty.💗 I can hear that howl and see that face! You betrayed her! 😛
<|emo_anger|> If the issue is Abortion yes. My generation was genocided.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow that's a burden, I'm sorry."
<|emo_joy|> I can see the place where I grew up on here :)
<|emo_joy|> Funny how the whole rape thing just vanished once he was appointed.
"<|emo_fear|> That's a yikes, no from me."
"<|emo_sad|> Hi Tired, I'm Dad. And I'm very disappointed in you for following your older brother's example and becoming a trap that poses for /b/"
"<|emo_joy|> Thanks a ton again, and honeslty haha im so ready to get out and have my own life for once"
<|emo_surprise|> What?! I am level 20 and I already had 4. I did 5 hide outs in total not counting the tutorial hide out.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I didn’t realize a simple medical term like obesity judged a person’s laziness and intelligence. 🙄
<|emo_joy|> You're happy that survs DC when you play killer? I'd rather actually play the game. Legion mains are weird sometimes.
"<|emo_fear|> i had all of those. checked myself with a GP and found out i had low iron, migraines and needed to visit the therapist re my anxiety."
"<|emo_joy|> I might be interested, been playing 5e in a couple campaigns now, happy to talk further!"
<|emo_sad|> The last message was particularly painful to read
<|emo_joy|> Many are interested due to [NAME] still high potential ceiling. And improved defensive abilities
<|emo_anger|> Not to mention people who illegally own guns probably aren't going to admit it for a study either.
"<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME], me and kiwi or pineapple. Or that feeling when a tortilla chip gets stuck in the roof of your mouth"
<|emo_disgust|> That fucking Mills charge is FUCKING BULLSHIT
"<|emo_surprise|> Ah, the frigid winds of teen rebellion..."
"<|emo_joy|> Great, petty revenge instead of making your GF happy by removing [NAME] from her life, nice job!"
<|emo_anger|> At least a feed of diazies stops me shitting the bed over the idea of a man wearing a dress. Uppa fuckin erps!!!
<|emo_sad|> I feel digestive regret just looking at them.
<|emo_anger|> The worst is when those moments pop up randomly. Especially when you’re feeling happy and then a mistake you did back in 2005 comes creeping up.
<|emo_disgust|> It's a song reference. The lyrics were awkward so one of my FB friends made a meme
<|emo_disgust|> so obnoxious.
<|emo_disgust|> No it’s a lie because he could not possibly have been in Vietnam. And he did not correct a single outlet who said he was.
"<|emo_joy|> Haha, thats brilliant."
<|emo_surprise|> congratulations :o)
"<|emo_joy|> Goodmorning, I wish you all a wonderful day."
<|emo_surprise|> >Star centre [NAME] in the leadership group Oh my
"<|emo_fear|> That guy was beyond cringe, it was creepy"
<|emo_surprise|> Wait what? I don’t get it?? Help.
"<|emo_surprise|> Man, I can’t believe we traded all that and didn’t even get a top 10 guy"
<|emo_anger|> There is only one metal that should be sliding down their throats. Ka-chunk!
<|emo_sad|> I'm so sorry. This is no way to be live or be treated. It's so immature and emotionally-abusive. I really hope your circumstances improve
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] stop
"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], they've turned into jerks."
"<|emo_sad|> Losing my identity, wondering have I gone insane..."
<|emo_anger|> I hate when I get extremely bored doing something that was once all consuming.
"<|emo_joy|> Happy birthday, [NAME]!"
<|emo_fear|> He’s 30 freaking years old and is scared of managing a bank account. *eyeroll*
<|emo_joy|> My Ping Pong Queen looks so happy! I cried lol
"<|emo_joy|> Congratulations, you did it"
<|emo_surprise|> It’s not outrageous though. Just a 2 night hotel stay alone for 1600 people will be around 200k.
<|emo_joy|> I prefer console and most of my friends play cod. I still enjoy gbs every year
<|emo_sad|> I don't think you're allowed to administer a vaccine to someone who is sick/injured.
<|emo_disgust|> I’ve never cringed so hard
<|emo_sad|> SHE MAKES ME CRINGE :(
<|emo_surprise|> Haha I actually didn't know about its existence! I honestly wonder how much of that map I've actually seen though. So many hours. Lol
"<|emo_disgust|> I am sorry for offending you "" WoW yOu WoNt EvEn LeT mY cHiLd Go ThErE aGaIn"" how tf. Whoops didnt mean to reply lol"
"<|emo_joy|> I don't know who the hell that is, but I will gladly upvote your post because it's not a stupid driving rant."
"<|emo_anger|> They didn't actually run any tests to confirm it was even bone, let alone human."
"<|emo_sad|> I’m telling ya, we really need to impose a basic hockey knowledge test to post here. I’m sick of the mouth breathers."
"<|emo_sad|> Or at least it could have been, but the pic is gone :("
<|emo_sad|> r/UpLiftingNews Edit: I just got banned for posting this there.
<|emo_anger|> That goddamn wink slayed me. Swoon so hard...
<|emo_sad|> This is going to be the last episode with my Latina goddess [NAME] 🌹😭
"<|emo_fear|> Sometimes I think it's like the movie *Shallow Hal*. You see the person for who they really are on the inside, and it's terrifying."
<|emo_disgust|> This is the funniest shit I've seen all day.
"<|emo_anger|> Its the easiest subject in the whole school, they teach us stuff we should’ve learned when we were 11, it’s so bad..."
<|emo_joy|> You’re truly welcome :)
<|emo_joy|> Oh hi [NAME]
"<|emo_disgust|> Yup, I rather take those small shots get messed up than drinking a diarrhea drink. "
<|emo_surprise|> Right? He actually came across as level headed and mature here so that was a shock.
"<|emo_disgust|> Verisimilitude, which here means, utter bs meant to help justify terrible favouritism."
<|emo_sad|> Awh you're hurt
"<|emo_joy|> I really enjoyed Fractured But Whole, but I don't remember the meals being significant (it's been like a year). Can you explain?"
<|emo_disgust|> You're gross
"<|emo_surprise|> #""""Haha so relatable omg so me"""""
<|emo_anger|> I must break you!
<|emo_anger|> Justice for that horrendous no call
<|emo_disgust|> Are you saying he screwed it up?
<|emo_surprise|> I'm honestly shocked that the Bucks have more subs than us. I was surprised the Wolves had more too.
<|emo_sad|> Ugh I am in this same place right now. Dating a husband whose wife calls all the shots. I feel for you.
"<|emo_joy|> Yes, I had to drive about 2 miles to the restaurant but I only waited 5 minutes. "
<|emo_joy|> Thanks so much for taking the initiative to do this! Not all heroes wear capes :)
<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe he got it while getting man-handled by two players!!
<|emo_anger|> And? Did i say they didnt? Read the whole thread you bimbo
"<|emo_anger|> I WILL NOT OBEY THAT ORDER, GENERAL! "
<|emo_joy|> You are welcome! I am so happy it worked :))
"<|emo_disgust|> that's weird, I thought we already had too many outfielders? edit: this was a joke."
"<|emo_joy|> Lol, get em Corsi! "
<|emo_joy|> happy to help
<|emo_surprise|> this is amazing
"<|emo_anger|> Justifying a potential rape because ""it's [NAME] and she should feel thankful,"" Wow. "
<|emo_anger|> Because it's not mildlyinfuriating that you have to ask strangers to not be assholes?
<|emo_sad|> Poor crack baby 😥
"<|emo_joy|> I'm betting my kids in MoCo will be off. Edit - MoCo announced, my house erupted in cheers"
<|emo_disgust|> Bless this woman. That honestly sounds horrific from every end. I hope her ex [NAME] has lived a horrendous life since perpetuating that disgusting act.
<|emo_disgust|> I'm generally a supporter of law enforcement.... But what the actual fuck.
<|emo_surprise|> That’s a real article ? Oh [NAME]...
<|emo_anger|> Dude I have a verrrrry strong feeling the barber did that on purpose. Nowhere in the world is that an acceptable haircut. That’s fucked up
"<|emo_surprise|> As someone who went through school before the internet existed, yes, weird creepy kids existed. Although it was more in your face. "
<|emo_sad|> I'm literally screaming.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow this is big. Thanks for the heads up. Indeed! So many great memories that I still like to reflect back on. Thanks!
"<|emo_fear|> I dont even try to land it, half the time if I am flying low a building or the ground will suck me up and destroy the plane"
"<|emo_sad|> I binged that podcast in about 2 days at work. Amazing. The convention for Limelight, and how emotional they got for those poor women was heartbreaking."
"<|emo_sad|> Losing my identity, wondering have I gone insane..."
<|emo_joy|> I'd be happy with a Goff win too. And you can't hate Brees. Rams vs. Chargers would be perfect. final score 72-70.
<|emo_surprise|> OMG! I need to make these. This looks so good!
<|emo_disgust|> Sucks that [NAME] won't get to play [NAME]
<|emo_sad|> Shit's going down in Zim. 6 people killed yesterday by army and over 200 arrested.
<|emo_fear|> Terrible... children are innocent and precious. This is so barbaric.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is amazing how dare you
<|emo_joy|> I’m fine with that. I’m happy to be banned from subs like that.
<|emo_sad|> Hey I’m going to eli today! Unfortunately for a funeral but hello stranger :)
"<|emo_anger|> Amazing that Aunt [NAME] wouldn't genuinely reflect on her her behavior, or realize that she is raising a spoiled, rude child."
<|emo_surprise|> Was he good back then?
<|emo_joy|> Patience. Give it another day or so. Send a text telling her you enjoyed her company and wanna do it again. Hopefully she responds
<|emo_disgust|> The whole post reeks of troll.
<|emo_joy|> Glad to hear. It seems like a very hopeful sign. 👍
<|emo_surprise|> What a baby...
<|emo_surprise|> That guy who melodramatically dances around playing horribly soppy poppy chord progressions over and over and does a cringy dance that makes me want to kill things?
<|emo_fear|> The thought of shooting anything at asylum seekers is appalling.
<|emo_joy|> 10/10 reading. I don't care if it happened this way or not. I was sufficiently entertained!
<|emo_disgust|> He gave his 20 year old ex herpies dumped her and she killed herself. He’s an awful person
<|emo_disgust|> no i intentionally dont wear ABUs
<|emo_surprise|> Wouldn’t be shocked for a lot of those guys to follow him to TB.
<|emo_disgust|> > or the thief charges you and you get sued and charged for setting up a trap on your own property As you fucking **should.**
<|emo_disgust|> Kinda let down tbh
<|emo_joy|> I wanna try it also. I think I had it when I was a kid but it’s been so long
<|emo_anger|> If I wanted to send a message about how much I hate my life and get literally no response then I could just text my mother.
"<|emo_joy|> But hey, at least it saves us the trouble of contacting them!"
<|emo_sad|> You didnt even ask the parents if they agreed to let him in the back?
<|emo_sad|> And the Reds. I subbed over at r/Reds after [NAME] went over there and their excitement at things actually happening fills me with envy
"<|emo_anger|> Your not winning their hearts, your just torturing them and they end up hating you."
<|emo_fear|> Wall St is scared of the 2020 Democratic primary.. Good!
"<|emo_disgust|> It's creepy but also sad that the guy was bathing in your fountain, hey at least it wasn't your pool. "
<|emo_joy|> You're in for a treat- enjoy :)
"<|emo_joy|> Everyone keeps giving me that advice haha. She's happily married to a really nice dude, and she is basically my sister at this point."
<|emo_surprise|> We might now be almost maybe nearly ready to potentially maybe play finals. I think [NAME] will make the finals this year. They'll be the surprise team.
"<|emo_sad|> So, the cops raided my favorite massage parlor today."
<|emo_surprise|> Shocking that a fat DnD kid is this self-important. Remarkable.
"<|emo_anger|> Short answer, fuck no, don't ever fall for it. Don't make the same mistake Canada has."
"<|emo_disgust|> Let [NAME] think about his performance for this 2 week break, god that was a brutal last 5 mins "
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry, new at "
<|emo_joy|> _Today I felt like drawing [NAME]_
<|emo_disgust|> Even if it’s available 24/7 on your new website 99% of it is ugly so people still won’t buy it.
<|emo_disgust|> “I am going to be going through a nasty divorce in a few years so I will need the money.” - [NAME]
<|emo_anger|> This is my biggest pet hate of all time!
<|emo_surprise|> Wow... never heard of that podcast. Looks awesome. Thanks for the link!
<|emo_anger|> I wanted to slap her when she told him she could have died and it would be his fault.
<|emo_fear|> > i find it very dog-like and adorable :) I find it very monster-like and terrifying :|
"<|emo_fear|> Yeah, that was terrible. [NAME] laughing and joking at the end of that game ended his career here."
"<|emo_sad|> We lap up the bitter tears of misguided young men, some weird stuff in here."
<|emo_sad|> Six shots on goal for [NAME] and still nothing. This breaks my heart.
"<|emo_joy|> I’m naming my dog Sebastian! So I can kinda relate ( lol, def not the same). Love the name though."
<|emo_sad|> This is the saddest thing I've seen today
<|emo_anger|> How dare you not find domestic abuse funny! /s
<|emo_joy|> I look cuter in red P’s.
<|emo_sad|> Did you even read the article? It's 1 anecdote and she wants to return because she misses her family.
"<|emo_joy|> Funny enough, not all [NAME] are celebrities."
<|emo_sad|> The sad part about this is that these memes are more Gen Z if anything...
<|emo_sad|> That hurt too much to watch twice.
<|emo_joy|> I like the Call Her Daddy Girls and I don’t care who knows it
<|emo_anger|> Wow that's not OK
<|emo_joy|> Maybe crazy dude is looking to bring water to [NAME] in the 90s-set Fresh Off the Boat. Something about [NAME] does it for me too. /s
<|emo_sad|> Oops! The lack of free trade caused the death of 20 Million proletariat!
<|emo_joy|> *wrap* happy birthday
<|emo_joy|> Might be an unpopular opinion but I actually enjoyed the faster ruck speed. Spewing they didn't stay strong and stick to their guns
<|emo_anger|> I’m just gonna go ahead and call bullshit on most of the details of this story.
<|emo_disgust|> Because the false accusation makes my anxiety worse
<|emo_anger|> I sure hope so! Smug bastards!
<|emo_anger|> As an anesthesia resident this made me blow air out my nose at an accelerated rate for several seconds. Take your damn upvote you bastard.
<|emo_surprise|> Right? Remember when she requested evidence of pill testing being successful? Then the stats came in from Canberra. #calledyourbluff
<|emo_surprise|> In shock and was more concerned about my kid tbh. Now off course I wish I'd sued the arse off her for emotional distress.
<|emo_sad|> That's so sad.
<|emo_anger|> The emoji at the end just made me want to slap her
<|emo_fear|> Trust me man. Don't see it. It's scarring.
"<|emo_surprise|> Is it weird that my first thought was ""at least it's not a Minion?"" "
<|emo_sad|> Sorry for your loss. My bestfriend is turning 13 soon and I'm trying to cherish every minute we still have.
<|emo_fear|> Now my mental image is narrowed down to a big imposing woman or a spidery woman that scares me just to be around.
<|emo_sad|> Damn.. fell for that one
"<|emo_disgust|> No, but I might choose to not support certain teams because their owners are trash."
"<|emo_disgust|> Only the fools would call Saigon the Pear of the Orient, haha. Stop sleeping on the past too much. And stop betraying your country"
<|emo_joy|> And the healthy snacks are on their way!
"<|emo_disgust|> Not having social media is such a blessing for me, it’s weird he messaged your mum though! I bet she loved hearing from him! "
<|emo_surprise|> HELL YEAH!!! And in only 7 months?? That’s such an achievement!
<|emo_disgust|> This is how far the Broncos have fallen. They no longer command the best and the brightest. Now it's .500 retreads. This should be concerning.
<|emo_disgust|> That’s downright creepy. It’s as if he’s testing if $50 will keep you quiet if he does inappropriate things.
<|emo_surprise|> I'm actually surprised none of his wives have stabbed him in his sleep already. Now he has secret service protection 😋
<|emo_joy|> i read your first sentence laughed and stopped reading easily verified basic historical facts are not conjecture genius
"<|emo_joy|> Brilliant! Like I said to the other dude, anything that's similar to this is a happy coincidence:)"
"<|emo_sad|> Hmmm Then it becomes about the wording of proposing to have dinner together, doesn't it.."
<|emo_anger|> Next you're gonna tell me they didn't invent iron! The fuck?
"<|emo_anger|> You're definitly an asshole, or a troll. Maybe both."
<|emo_surprise|> HURRY HARD!
"<|emo_surprise|> Important part of this, surprising it's not there. "
<|emo_joy|> I hope that the talk goes ok. Though with these justno's it may not. I'm glad that you are prepared if it goes south.
"<|emo_anger|> If someone has tithed 10% their entire life, fuck off with requests like this."
<|emo_joy|> FYI this gif is a hit on [NAME] so yeah both sides think this is hilarious!
"<|emo_sad|> I’ll miss you, [NAME] Today is a sad day for our high sock loving brethren [NAME]"
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry, no. We’re just going to export [NAME] to you guys. "
<|emo_anger|> BALL DONT LIE
<|emo_disgust|> This thread is one of worst things I've ever read
<|emo_surprise|> What the fuck did I just read?
<|emo_joy|> I think [NAME] did such a classy exit! Hopefully people don’t give her too much hate. She comes from a good place.
<|emo_disgust|> That's the worst possible outcome
"<|emo_sad|> Oh [NAME], just when I'd forgotten about that..."
<|emo_disgust|> Disgusting. Truly disgusting.
<|emo_joy|> You sound fun at parties
"<|emo_surprise|> So she knows of 3 languages, Wonder what they are?"
<|emo_joy|> oh! I have more ships this time! Niice!
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, wow. Hope nothing happens to his arms on the way!"
<|emo_joy|> dang... that's just crazy.
"<|emo_disgust|> Ugh I did this at a work conference and ran straight into the guest speaker. The flashbacks are rough, probably for her too I imagine. "
<|emo_fear|> Just imagine Disney characters without gloves. Yes it's that horrifying
<|emo_anger|> *my fat normie slut*
<|emo_joy|> Holy shit they fornicate like rabbits!!
<|emo_surprise|> With those pieces I’d be surprised 😒
<|emo_anger|> I would like to see the after justice of idiots like this
<|emo_anger|> Put the dip in your butthole. Better buzz and no risk of losing your jaw
<|emo_sad|> Here's a purple heart for you recapping that! OMG matching romantic scoots I'm cryin'
"<|emo_fear|> Don’t worry, [NAME] already added it to his collection."
<|emo_anger|> > How scummy can you get? ricescummy
<|emo_surprise|> Only children are scared to take trains by themselves ...oh wait.
<|emo_surprise|> Surprised Colorado ain’t got one the way things have been going here past couple years
"<|emo_anger|> No, stop! He'll stop cranking the job machine if you insult him again!"
<|emo_anger|> You sick fuck it has heads and arms we can’t eat that.
<|emo_surprise|> This was potentially the most dangerous stunt I have ever seen someone do. One minor mistake and you die.
<|emo_joy|> I am having fun haha :D *creeper mode on* jk lol
<|emo_disgust|> That feel when your friends are all relieved by your insane driving skills.
<|emo_anger|> What a heel.
"<|emo_joy|> Lol, pinches narizones.. Their physical game is on another level. Would rather play with a guy like that instead of against him though that's for sure."
"<|emo_surprise|> They get pissy about ""automatic defenses"" for property. I mean, *REALLY* pissy."
<|emo_disgust|> Oh wow. That sucks to hear about [NAME]. I guess not uncommon with a bad family life.
<|emo_sad|> I'm...not going to let him see me cry.
<|emo_disgust|> Pretty sure he's by far and away the biggest asshat on this sub lmao
<|emo_surprise|> >Ultimate 12 Inch *notices bulge* *OwO what's this?*
"<|emo_disgust|> they sounds like autistic meltdowns triggered by an immense fear of vomiting, nothing much to do"
"<|emo_anger|> Truth. If he had time for another relationship, he has time to pay for it. "
"<|emo_anger|> There is another trash article from slate on there now, And it looks like they are posting more edited few-second long clips. They are obsessed with destroying them."
<|emo_sad|> Uh . . . Uh . . . I'm not feeling so well.
<|emo_anger|> Why in the world did you marry her? She's ragging on your own sister???
"<|emo_fear|> No, it means you have a problem with homophobia and paranoia. A big one. No pun intended."
<|emo_joy|> That and customizable CSS makes me so happy. /r/Firefoxcss if you’re interested : )
<|emo_disgust|> Damn MLM at its worst
<|emo_disgust|> Well one of them is a dirty kimono wearing weirdo
"<|emo_anger|> It’s crazy how invisible, worthless internet points control us"
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, someone had a lot of golds to give!!"
"<|emo_disgust|> My ETL been trying to tell us every box should take us 30 seconds max, and everyone ive asked about that has laughed and called it bullshit"
<|emo_disgust|> They have directly targeted civilians. It's disgusting.
"<|emo_fear|> >He was deeply and utterly insecure, and it was pathetic. He still is. And it still is."
<|emo_anger|> Way too fancy
<|emo_surprise|> Sounds magical!
<|emo_disgust|> Am an FX artist. This is fake. Scar wax gives it away so badly.
<|emo_disgust|> Yes. Half the posts on this sub are about posing. I think the pose she is pulling is ridiculous too...
<|emo_joy|> I feel like you two know each
<|emo_joy|> A different joke. Scenic!
"<|emo_sad|> My childhood horse died due to twisted intestines. Very traumatizing, since he crawled over and put his head in my lap at the end."
<|emo_fear|> Death by snu snu
"<|emo_disgust|> It was weird, but there were usually just 5/6 players at each scene at most, and the rest would be usually doing other stuff."
<|emo_disgust|> seriously wtf. I want to see how the whole hand went in detail. that was the sickest soulread ever
<|emo_anger|> Oy! NOW THAT'S REALLY PISSED IT OFF!!
<|emo_disgust|> Oh lord that's nasty. Guess I'm getting some fried chicken tonight.
<|emo_surprise|> Hahaha the build up is hilarious and the ending is the best. They really think he is badass
<|emo_anger|> Games like this are just demoralizing for our players.
<|emo_fear|> I had a similar fear last month after exceeding the two hours in a Homebase car park.
"<|emo_fear|> Tl, dr - Take the abuse. Squirming only gets them off more."
<|emo_disgust|> My bad I’ll try to do better
<|emo_fear|> Their entire life is based around who/what they object to because they are too scared to be *for* anything.
<|emo_sad|> I've never been this sad in my life!
<|emo_joy|> Sweet! I'm a Packers fan in Winnipeg. Really hoping to catch a game there next season.
<|emo_surprise|> Stranger things have happened.
<|emo_disgust|> It's been with me all day. Those reams of entries is one of the most quietly horrific things I've ever seen.
<|emo_sad|> Our [NAME] is going off bro. [NAME] is gonna out-Jack you off.
<|emo_anger|> I wouldn’t expect anything less than those deplorable traitorous trumptards.
<|emo_anger|> My ecology professor hated outdoor cats for that reason. They're extremely destructive animals.
<|emo_anger|> I want to die
<|emo_sad|> Don't you're making me paranoid man
"<|emo_anger|> Calm down, dickwad"
"<|emo_joy|> Alright then, I'm glad to hear that. I hope it's handled in any case."
<|emo_joy|> Im so glad I grew up killing infants at hospitals instead of being on my nokia
<|emo_surprise|> Wonder if it’s possible for [NAME] to engage with a polite fan in a magnanimous way.
<|emo_anger|> Congrats on the mild success of your stolen story
<|emo_sad|> My condolences.
<|emo_anger|> I don’t like [NAME] in the slightest but I hate [NAME] even more. Get her Belcalis
"<|emo_anger|> I'll chase you till the ends of the eaaaaarth, Shooooooooooooooooooooooooooocker!!!!!!!"
<|emo_surprise|> Oh that's good!
"<|emo_disgust|> Shoot, darn. You win again!"
<|emo_anger|> See as sad as I am I can’t hate anyone here.
<|emo_disgust|> Idealogues are annoying.
<|emo_surprise|> All that and still tweeting about real and perceived insults.
"<|emo_anger|> And he doesn’t even stop. It’s your work truck, man! They’re going to find out regardless. "
<|emo_fear|> The comment came up as a text notification and old people are always convinced hackers are getting into their phones.
"<|emo_disgust|> It’s a disgusting mix of mayonnaise, ketchup, and pickle relish."
"<|emo_joy|> Seriously, I’ve been catching and loving this one since it first came out."
<|emo_anger|> Out of control by darude. Just get carried away by the sounds man
"<|emo_sad|> If many people truly see that as a consequence, I'd suggest SD's public [NAME] needs some work. Sad."
<|emo_joy|> Haha I can drink to that! Cheers man!
<|emo_sad|> I don’t think anyone will miss me either aha
<|emo_surprise|> We saw them last year from Baker Beach. So many whales!
<|emo_anger|> It's murder and the kid can die I don't care but call it what it is and let parents know their kids whenever they want
<|emo_disgust|> Dude I have a verrrrry strong feeling the barber did that on purpose. Nowhere in the world is that an acceptable haircut. That’s fucked up
"<|emo_disgust|> Bore off, you pearl-clutching, centerist coward. "
<|emo_fear|> I'm REALLY glad the guy saved him but seeing him so pitiful and scared really lingers with me. :(
"<|emo_sad|> Holy bait-and-switch, [NAME]. I’m so sorry, that has to be incredibly stressful to have to be around and deal with."
<|emo_disgust|> They are angry virgin children because he plays the game like it was supposed to be played. SOT has the most pathetic community ever.
<|emo_disgust|> It should be people not petting being jerks
<|emo_anger|> Calm down. What the hell. I just tryed to tell you that there MEIGHT be a different side to that story.
<|emo_fear|> That hop/shuffle is scary
<|emo_fear|> Can't you tell that [NAME] is a serious threat to apprehend. All that alleged lying makes him a serious threat to others.
<|emo_disgust|> Ok but what if you hire him into a management position. He makes women feel uncomfortable and a discrimination suit waiting to happen.
<|emo_sad|> I wish I could forget. Stop reminding me :(
<|emo_disgust|> This is why I stopped watching. :( The brutality was disgusting.
<|emo_sad|> I am clueless lately. None of my students parents speak English. It breaks my heart because I want to have more open communication.
<|emo_anger|> Fuck why didn’t I think of that
"<|emo_anger|> Meanwhile, 1500 a day continue to die from cigarettes"
<|emo_anger|> Iirc congressional opposition was the main obstacle for closing gitmo. I could be misremembering but that's what I remember
<|emo_disgust|> Yup this game just gets worse and worse
<|emo_disgust|> Learning to read was the worst mistake of my life
<|emo_fear|> The biggest Nightmare
<|emo_sad|> I’d go [NAME]. [NAME] gets raked on any mistake I throw personally
<|emo_surprise|> That video was so shaky I thought I had Cerebellar Hypoplasia for a minute.
<|emo_sad|> I've had sleep paralysis once and it is really bad.
<|emo_anger|> How is it racist? I fail to see how.
<|emo_joy|> I've been seeing these since I was a kid! Wish we all had an answer...
"<|emo_sad|> Yes, and then look hurt when you glare at them for causing a scene and/or not being just as tickled as they are."
<|emo_anger|> Yeah weird feelings too
"<|emo_disgust|> The rich are horrible, horrible people..... and yet we keep voting GOP to give them more tax breaks, the hell is wrong with us?"
<|emo_sad|> I wanna hug my mom dead named me waking me up for school
<|emo_disgust|> Leave they don't deserve you and you don't need those sacks of shit
<|emo_joy|> This is awesome. I have so much junk in my head that I need to address the way you describe. Thanks for sharing.
<|emo_anger|> Lol stfu really
<|emo_joy|> I had season seats in 230 row 2 for a solid 5 years when the Pru just opened. Great view of the ice. Glad you had fun!
<|emo_joy|> Welcome to the subreddit!
"<|emo_sad|> :( disappointed, i expected to give out personal therapy cats."
"<|emo_sad|> I don't wish abortions on any woman. It's a terrible thing to endure. Necessary, sure, but it's still grim."
<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting. And not one parent thought that was a *bit* inappropriate? smh
"<|emo_surprise|> From ""woohoo!!"" to blood curdling screams in a matter of seconds."
<|emo_disgust|> this study is bull but only cos my waist is just 2 inches larger than my head and im still dumb as hell
<|emo_anger|> So what you are saying is that you are not a serious guitarist is you use finger guards?
<|emo_anger|> Play stupid games and win stupid prizes dude.
<|emo_disgust|> You don’t know what love is till you’ve fished a turd out of the bathtub for someone.
"<|emo_anger|> I would shoot a cop who shot my animal. Save the consequences for later, you just assaulted and possibly mortally wounded my best friend. ACAB"
<|emo_fear|> Omg creepy!
<|emo_joy|> One of my favorite episodes.
<|emo_fear|> Nothing seems to intrigue or satisfy me only drugs and thats sad.
"<|emo_surprise|> yep, I witnessed a broken blood vessel in the eye from stifling a sneeze"
<|emo_anger|> Because it's so ridiculously stupid people just can't help themselves.
<|emo_sad|> Hello. I’m sorry you’re going through that. Why do you think it’s impossible to leave?
<|emo_anger|> Shut up cowpoke
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, 5 downvotes in 3 minutes. Go you!"
<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised no one's talking about the guy in the picture. What a thrussy!
<|emo_disgust|> The “targets” so far has been guilty.
<|emo_surprise|> Beverly Hills. They did a whole season about UNDERWEAR. I can't imagine why anyone would pick Jersey in this current phase of [NAME] domination.
<|emo_disgust|> This is horrible
<|emo_surprise|> That's the first time I have seen OG pass up that kind of opportunity.
<|emo_anger|> Yeah cause no man has ever been falsely imprisoned due to allegations proven later to be false
<|emo_sad|> The little “you hurt me so badly but I’m gonna be brave” yea... at the end oh my [NAME]. Your friend sucks.
<|emo_disgust|> that was a horrible call
<|emo_joy|> No I’m happy to spend big on myself. I’m not happy to spend my money on layabout benefits claimants.
<|emo_anger|> Don't call me bitch you fucking sexist. I bet you are one of those white devils. How many women and minorities have you suppressed today?
<|emo_sad|> Kid has a disease/condition where his skin falls off at the slightest touch
"<|emo_disgust|> Thanks for showing me the most degenerate thing I've seen so far in 2019, and that includes a scat subreddit."
<|emo_disgust|> That's not even the sub I put. Bad bot.
<|emo_anger|> Ohhhh now I get it Omg I'm so stupid
"<|emo_sad|> It’s all good man, I missed [NAME] too. I REALLY hope we get another dream sequence with him in EP4. "
<|emo_sad|> The lack of fantasy nowadays is incredible.
"<|emo_anger|> Exit scam. Check out their cold wallets, holy shit."
<|emo_joy|> This looks like [NAME] at the gym
"<|emo_sad|> Unfortunately, I don't. Sorry. 😔"
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, amazing job, Mr. [NAME]! Another liberal absolutely DESTROYED with facts and logic! So eloquent and wise..."
<|emo_surprise|> Two homes? In this economy?!
"<|emo_anger|> I feel bad for them now, but if they ever get good I’ll hate them like the rest. "
<|emo_joy|> Couldn't have said it better. Just did the same over my winter break and really got to know myself a lot better. Cheers to the new year!
<|emo_fear|> Still waiting on [NAME] to tell me how GIFs are terrible and I can’t afford to watch anymore of them.
"<|emo_anger|> Well, my answer tried to be funny and witty. But apparently it struck some insecurities in some guys."
"<|emo_joy|> i’n on a diet for my disease AND to lose weight therefore it cancels out boys, i’m scot free"
<|emo_joy|> Give me $100 and I'll text you something fun. Sounds like paid sexting to me.
<|emo_disgust|> Man I hate that [NAME] guy.
<|emo_anger|> Of fucking course it is...
<|emo_anger|> And that he’s not white
<|emo_sad|> I’d go at [NAME] every possession. He is so tired out there
"<|emo_anger|> Eh, some people grow up, get tired of banging their heads and decide to start using them instead 😜"
<|emo_joy|> What a funny story.
<|emo_sad|> I don’t even like [NAME] that much but she completely failed to engage with his work critically. Her interpretations of his arguments were shockingly poor.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wouldnt believe that much, surely rather stay and win the league first, cant blame him tbh"
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow that is one part disgusting and another part a huge waste of time for expecting an entertaining payoff. Warning, this video also includes spoilers for the latest Avengers."
<|emo_anger|> The fuck?! You're in the wrong subreddit with this regressive bullshit victim blaming.
<|emo_fear|> I know 😢 it’s one of my life’s goals to see a moose in real life despite how terrified I will be lol!!
<|emo_fear|> This is so creepy. Good riddance to awful rubbish.
<|emo_disgust|> Vancouver is even more ridiculous.
<|emo_anger|> Now I feel like an idiot calling it a beamer for the 15 years I played baseball.
"<|emo_fear|> Matinee games should not be allowed for us anymore, we’re terrible at matinee games"
<|emo_joy|> Finally got this in the mail today. I'm pretty excited. My favorite ballplayer.
<|emo_joy|> Yes! Love me rotties!
"<|emo_joy|> Haha, thats brilliant."
"<|emo_anger|> He can have his opinion, but he doesn't have to state when *no one* asked."
<|emo_anger|> Honestly tho. Please stop posting this. We've been seeing this shit since at least 2003 and I was born in 02 ffs
<|emo_joy|> Cheers!!
<|emo_anger|> This is infuriating but what’s also infuriating is missing all of our chances and players being constantly in offsides positions
<|emo_disgust|> Terrible shade of lipstick she's wearing...
"<|emo_joy|> Excellent game tonight, let's get a new win streak going on this road trip!"
<|emo_disgust|> Breathing out like a dragon keeps me from gagging when i brush the back of my tongue
"<|emo_disgust|> Everything is political, bub. "
<|emo_sad|> I did this first try but then the next time I played I was ducking hollering
<|emo_sad|> This post is another reason why I'll never go back to Heroes. The loot box RNG was so cruel to me
<|emo_anger|> Just throw them into a pool of needles. That'll teach them not to steal ever again.
<|emo_anger|> You can't argue that these are the same when clearly one of them has a monopoly over the market.
<|emo_surprise|> How have you not seen this movie yet?
<|emo_fear|> FO need to pull the trigger ASAP. If he’s on this roster after the deadline... [NAME] help us
<|emo_sad|> And the sad part is this goes on for decades and decades grrrrrrr
<|emo_sad|> Hurr durr everyone needs to worry about other people’s problems
<|emo_sad|> I shouldn't be tanking this much rating after even a year bro. You don't understand how bad it feels to be in this garbage elo.
"<|emo_surprise|> Yes, ~~jack~~ jake will be great too! Love the audio mixer with the old Spiderman soundtracks...looks very well produced..."
"<|emo_fear|> You're fine! Go ahead and vent, that's sorta what this subreddit's for. I'm the same way, don't worry."
"<|emo_disgust|> fuck these dysfunctional, insecure mattresses"
"<|emo_surprise|> I’m still using a laptop from 2008, and until last month I was using a phone from 2013. Actually felt bad upgrading the phone."
<|emo_anger|> Id be pretty pissed if my prime didn't auto renew
"<|emo_sad|> I can feel that already, I'm already getting pain at time with it, but I can only imagine the pain after for healing."
"<|emo_fear|> This is the most scary [NAME] can ever be to me, cause it’s also the most real he could ever be 😂"
<|emo_anger|> Maybe a relationship where you don't live together would suit him better. Some people feel suffocated when they are with their partner for long stretches of time.
"<|emo_sad|> Did a lousy job, my dishes are still dirty."
<|emo_joy|> Woooooo theres the boeser we know and love
"<|emo_sad|> Also, on my phone this didn't show up as a ""cross post"". Sorry!"
<|emo_anger|> You'd think people who have this high an opinion of themselves would be more open to taking advice on how to beat certain matchups. Enjoy being a scrub.
<|emo_disgust|> There is an actual subreddit for cheating. It's disgusting.
"<|emo_fear|> Yeah that’s one of the things I’m most worried about, still hopeful!"
"<|emo_fear|> Nah, black bears are big scaredy cats Now brown ones on the other hand..."
<|emo_joy|> Hello! Happy new years my friend!
"<|emo_fear|> Good, I need an hour to align my chakras for the impending stress "
<|emo_joy|> Haha! Do it.
<|emo_fear|> Why is it that young girls seem to idolise serial killers? I had a friend like this and never understood the attraction. It's scary
"<|emo_disgust|> uh, i don't see the correlation between tons of rape and murders in Georgia and the rich needing to be taxed more, but i do agree."
<|emo_sad|> It is true. But the real reason for the problem is the selfishness of the people.
"<|emo_anger|> Deadass? Shoook?? Come on [NAME], do you really talk like that? You sound dumb. "
<|emo_anger|> I’m just gonna go ahead and call bullshit on most of the details of this story.
<|emo_sad|> Wha? I’m so confused. I’m so sorry this happened because it wasn’t remotely warranted.
<|emo_anger|> B plug? What the hell. Use an A plug or you're never going to become doctor some day.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my god Del Monico. Horrific. Even the ambient smell in the hallways makes me gag.
<|emo_surprise|> That’s one big-ass bath candle.
"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah. 99percent of ""cute"" videos of mixed species on reddit make me anxious because all I can see is bad animal husbandry. "
"<|emo_surprise|> Wait so you can get an acre of rainforest for $35? I mean, it would be way cheaper at that volume but still that's real cheap"
<|emo_surprise|> weird. i went 3/3 earlier.
<|emo_joy|> I don't mind posts bashing NOED or DS. But I wish this one would make sense or would be funny.
<|emo_anger|> I just see a car incessantly hogging the middle lane despite being undertaken on the inside!
"<|emo_joy|> Haha, same bro. I am lvl 21 and still playing at least 4hrs a day. Loving it!"
"<|emo_sad|> Yea feel sad for that kid, that native guy is an anti [NAME] activist who destroyed his life "
"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] does seem a little high strung. Did you see him on [NAME] podcast? WOW. Still, cool dude."
<|emo_joy|> Wtf if this is true it’s the funniest thing I’ve read all day.
<|emo_disgust|> The sin was refusing to impregnate his brother's widow when [NAME] directly told him to. It's not just about wasting semen.
<|emo_anger|> Fucking refs suck my balls.
"<|emo_surprise|> Thank [NAME] , surprising he doesn't want the mets deal"
<|emo_disgust|> Plus [NAME] has won before. [NAME] is a perennial loser. All he has ever done is played on teams that were the worst in the NHL.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wait, WHAT?!?!"
<|emo_sad|> then its lost man. So sad!...its terrible
<|emo_surprise|> WHAT A TWIST!!
<|emo_fear|> oh my [NAME]. it was hurting my brain. i only saw the disappearing boot and thought i was missing something.
"<|emo_sad|> Grey socks and leather sandals, that hurts me through the screen."
<|emo_sad|> Being born in north america is a curse my friend. Oregon (my home) is kind of like Ireland weather wise though I hear.
<|emo_disgust|> You conveniently forgot nearly killing a toddler by throwing furniture out of a 14 story window.
<|emo_joy|> Wow so glad [NAME] is getting it done quicker. Better for later in tourney
<|emo_surprise|> That's really interesting. How come?
<|emo_disgust|> Terfs smell like bigots in general. Sort of a salty smell
<|emo_sad|> You're back but you're still broken.
<|emo_surprise|> That’s a new level of blonde I never knew existed!
<|emo_sad|> I saw 25yr old with 3 kids and a house. How do u think I feel. I'm over 30 and still single.
"<|emo_joy|> Actually probably trust issues, but thought people here would enjoy it. "
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME], what? Why are you even here. Fuck off."
<|emo_surprise|> So..... it looks like dude is willing to break his own neck to help a vegan who is choking.
<|emo_disgust|> What does that even mean? What a uselessly vague statement.
<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting. Apt.
<|emo_surprise|> Omg if WOW sue’s her then my depression would be cured and I’ll have my jush
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME].
<|emo_disgust|> So long as it's for the worse I'm all for the wait!
<|emo_anger|> Once upon a time I got banned for a whole day because of bad behavior... Oh wait that was all of us...
<|emo_disgust|> Now this is poke choking!
"<|emo_fear|> My darling, have you bowed down to worship the ancient one yet? We are very worried. "
"<|emo_anger|> IT SEEMS THAT YOU ARE GOING TO APPROVE ME, I HOPE DO NOT PASS THE SAME AS WITH THE OTHER GIRL ... 😳"
<|emo_surprise|> I Can't Believe It's Not Butter.
<|emo_sad|> Still depressed but I didn't run away so it cool
<|emo_fear|> Now my mental image is narrowed down to a big imposing woman or a spidery woman that scares me just to be around.
<|emo_anger|> Wtf is this lmao god I hate reddit
<|emo_disgust|> Try painting a penis around the pothole. Seems to have worked in Manchester
<|emo_anger|> What's even worse: the deciding voter refused to support the subway because he was strangely obsessed with a horse & buggy transit plan from 1858.
"<|emo_joy|> Great, so we know the spanish pronounciation is therefore racist and now I'm offended by it."
<|emo_sad|> Being misunderstood really is the worst thing ever! I’m sorry some people are so unkind.
"<|emo_anger|> They were not really messing around, just more frustrated. They genuinely were trying to move specialists around to get the best out of people."
"<|emo_fear|> For as long as she’s been gone, I’m terrified to think why she was kept alive that long."
<|emo_surprise|> Like....what even is the purpose of that lie? Ahaha
<|emo_surprise|> Have you ever brought up your concern before? I understand if that is the only issue but if it doesn't change it could fester.
<|emo_joy|> Go on a group vacation!! Or a concert weekend that’d be fun!
<|emo_surprise|> Niemi locked in holy fuck.
<|emo_disgust|> Don't be an asshole
<|emo_sad|> Females living on Recruit difficulty. Smh
<|emo_surprise|> Wow the [NAME] replies appeared in less than ten minutes this time!
<|emo_anger|> I think they're all equally bad in their own way.

<|emo_joy|> Hell yeah. Enjoy your new bachelor life son!
<|emo_sad|> I'm not crying... you're crying!

<|emo_surprise|> Only 7? Wow he's slacking. He must not have very faithful parishioners.
"<|emo_joy|> Brilliant! Like I said to the other dude, anything that's similar to this is a happy coincidence:)"

<|emo_sad|> There is no way around it :(
<|emo_joy|> Good stuff man. Love the passion.
<|emo_anger|> Get out of my head.
"<|emo_joy|> What? lol no. I feel bad they have to, but there are legit people who enjoy wearing it to show devotion."
<|emo_disgust|> I hate how much I love these and the Banquet brownies. Only redeeming part.
<|emo_sad|> Bet Highland Council are sorry they sold their bunker last year.
<|emo_disgust|> You dirty scavenger
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] these are hideous
"<|emo_disgust|> the trajectory of that is really weird! But [NAME], that guys arm, hand, possibly head is not liking the next .01 second!"
"<|emo_sad|> First [NAME], now [NAME]. Stop the conks. Please. "
"<|emo_fear|> I've have a serious fear of getting winded, this video made my balls fall off "
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad I'm not the only one that allocates points for road kills.

<|emo_anger|> Well you're lying about my pun being better bitch
<|emo_surprise|> How? They don't have SoundCloud or anything and it's usually played before you're killed.
"<|emo_anger|> The problem is that data shows graphics sell, gameplay doesn't. It really sucks though, I wish they gave us a toggle at least "
"<|emo_sad|> Oh damn, that would have been the only correct response! ""Sorry, but I have a boyfriend."" End of conversation."
<|emo_anger|> I’m not sure even know sits a fucking painter’s tool. I hate everything about everyone in this video.
<|emo_joy|> Wow. Of COURSE this happened

<|emo_joy|> You must live in a cozy little bubble then.
<|emo_sad|> People would still always parry them (600ms) :(
<|emo_fear|> If you really think a horror movie needs jump scares then I feel bad for you son.
"<|emo_sad|> I only use freedom units, sorry."
<|emo_disgust|> That was the worst power play I’ve ever seen
<|emo_surprise|> OMG kids are dying from polio??
<|emo_fear|> It's wonderful because it's awful. At not with.

"<|emo_joy|> Paraphrasing [NAME], this brought warm feelings to my heart."
<|emo_anger|> Debs a bitch
"<|emo_anger|> I don't date women who smoke. As for pills or syringes etc, I don't find recreational drug users attractive. Similarly for being drunk."
<|emo_anger|> I'm the one who died inside here
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] isn’t a rocket scientist. I was surprised about the Thailand thing tbh I did expect it to be true haha.

<|emo_sad|> im sorry for your loss. your aunts behavior is disgusting. dont give her anything.
<|emo_joy|> This happens to me a lot. I'll also sing the same phrase over and over.
"<|emo_sad|> Kind of wish they recorded a video of the shard of glass moving through the heart, we would all pee a little in our pants."
<|emo_disgust|> So the article is pretty much nonsense.
<|emo_joy|> Good bot!
<|emo_surprise|> This kind of sacrafice should cost at least 100.000.wanting it for free is what shocks me here most.
"<|emo_surprise|> I’m surprised it was uploaded today, especially since he uploaded a video just a few hours ago"
<|emo_joy|> I was entertained into the 4th. My sons played well. We lost. I'll take it.
"<|emo_anger|> LG are getting worldstarred on their host, tragic stuff "

<|emo_surprise|> The fuck? That ball was still on the ground tho.
"<|emo_joy|> i love these wholesome stories when they appear in this sub. nice one, OP!"
<|emo_joy|> Hahaha love it
"<|emo_anger|> Except they fucking awarded it a prize first. It went through vetting, beat the other applicants, won, then was removed as not being correct?"
"<|emo_disgust|> Read it again. Your response shows you didn't understand what I said. ""YES"" = yes you need a degree."
<|emo_surprise|> How did limewire make money?
<|emo_sad|> I just wanted my knees to stop hurting
<|emo_joy|> You can see his tooth bouncing off the pavement on the right after he falls. Brings a tear of joy to my eye 😅

"<|emo_disgust|> Thanks. Screw the cancellation rate, it’s worth denying <4.7. Good to know!"
<|emo_anger|> Your using emotionl blackmail. Does the vet save cancer or destroy cancer? [NAME] = Vet. Your using babies and all sorts of things to manipulate. Vets only do the right thing.
"<|emo_disgust|> ""We've won the AFC less often than you have"" is a weird flex"
<|emo_anger|> > husband probably came out blasting like the dude in the bathroom in pulp fiction Except this dude actually hit what he was shooting at.
<|emo_joy|> Cool story bro!
"<|emo_anger|> That just shows how similar people can be in this kind of situation, demanding, rude, and can sometimes damage stuff without care"
<|emo_surprise|> Completely off-topic but Ok I'm Officially Intrigued by Watchmen.
<|emo_fear|> I fear it is already too late if he already uses words that should hurt but really don't because of their misuse.

<|emo_sad|> Is this funny but sad? This just seems like a normal meme to me
<|emo_disgust|> Those are some pissed off lookin Nucks
"<|emo_anger|> If this was some weird publicity stunt to announce the [NAME] is coming back I will die. In reality, it makes me think he's coming back"

"<|emo_fear|> No, mom doesn’t like fights and my sisters afraid of getting hit (even though he doesn’t hit her)"
<|emo_anger|> Did [NAME] mention the astroturf pitch after today's comfortable 3-0 win? He certainly made a big fuss about it after the loss at Rugby Park.
<|emo_joy|> Love the way his body just folds after the final smack on his head *oof*
"<|emo_sad|> Don't worry, [NAME] is there."
"<|emo_anger|> Takes a lot less effort to just say “fuck off, buy your own.”"
"<|emo_fear|> Nope, in reality this does never happen indeed. Cant we see what the problem is here?"
<|emo_anger|> He must've done something real bad. I played with a guy who by all counts was an asshole but never received more than mutes.
"<|emo_joy|> I got a weird vibe when he was placed on Colliton's staff, so I'm really glad it's turned out the way it did. "
<|emo_joy|> This reminds me of the Percy Jackson series :P they do the same thing at one point when they visit a dam :P
<|emo_surprise|> really thought he'd hit a bird for the longest time.
"<|emo_sad|> ah, if only i could hug a beautiful and understanding woman and cry all my depression around her neck."

<|emo_disgust|> He really would be. It's not even an abortion anymore!;It's just post-birth killing!
"<|emo_anger|> >Yeah, people ruin everything with their useless comments... the irony "
<|emo_sad|> This is the saddest thing I've seen today
<|emo_anger|> Good that corporate knows about it. They'll launch a LP investigation and fuck the idiots doing this.
<|emo_surprise|> What did I just read
<|emo_disgust|> So smart it looks like he shut his fingers in the door. That’s a nasty bruise under his fingernail.
<|emo_sad|> Oof. Some bad D right there. [NAME] not much help
<|emo_sad|> “Got caught talking about meditation” Sounds terrible I am so sorry you had to go through that kind of thought policing.
"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, the level of evidence that you accept is more or less abysmal."
<|emo_sad|> The left side attack of [NAME] [NAME] was woeful
<|emo_anger|> Allow me to describe the shock and awe I experienced seeing this: **Fuck no why u do this?**
<|emo_joy|> So so good

"<|emo_surprise|> Wait, which ones can do it now? Seriously, I don't really know this one."
<|emo_surprise|> Iirc she's alive but an alcoholic.
"<|emo_joy|> I don't know why, but the thought of that hat on smoke makes me smile..."
<|emo_joy|> This is why im happy [NAME] is our owner. I don’t see him being a cheapskate
<|emo_joy|> The only clown that make me laugh.
<|emo_anger|> Seeing [NAME] on Sunday and I'm so fucking stoked

<|emo_anger|> Yeah well first god says it’s an abomination. Also if people find out everyone will hate me and my parents will be extremely angry
"<|emo_anger|> But atacking it over and over again is considered griefing, you wanted to shoot fishes in a barrel over and over and got caught."
<|emo_surprise|> Wtf Powerhouse Macomb is the gym I go to. I've never seen this dude there.
<|emo_disgust|> I’d say this is spot on. He’s not sorry he hurt me. He just wants me to shut up.
"<|emo_sad|> It absolutely is. Sadly, most players seem to only want [NAME] with different aesthetics."
<|emo_surprise|> Geez those heroes..
<|emo_anger|> I gotcha. Why do you think you’re driving them away though? I feel like you’re blaming yourself way more than you should be
<|emo_anger|> You're an awful human being.

"<|emo_anger|> Fuck it, maybe the faceless men worship the great other AND assassinated the fire warlocks in valyria, hwo knows?"
<|emo_anger|> Find a new doctor. If he isn't willing to treat people because of political affiliation then he's a horrible doctor and an even worse person.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is just another millionaire taking advantage of dumb people.
<|emo_anger|> All star is a popularity contest voted by the fans. Stupid as fuck. [NAME] should be an all star this year
"<|emo_joy|> If you're worried about cost, getting a double edged safety razor is a much better choice, also way better for the environment."
<|emo_joy|> Unless you have actual ADHD lol. But I think this was mostly meant to be funny
<|emo_anger|> Benzos do not help anxiety long term. they make it worse
"<|emo_sad|> You arent going to be making 10 million dollars in your business, this wont affect you."

<|emo_disgust|> Franz Ferdinand are awful too
"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, try to buy a relationship, good idea..."
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if Belpedio will get a chance up here at some point.

"<|emo_fear|> I dread the day something happens in Ireland, we've been sheltered from the most of it."
<|emo_anger|> This isn't so bad. The fact that the buttons only go up halfway doesn't bug me at all. At. All...
"<|emo_anger|> Oh damn, it’s gonna hunt me down. "
"<|emo_anger|> Yeah like ""oh yeah? No shit?"""
"<|emo_joy|> I am happy to receive constructive advice. If someone is short, or not constructive, I will react to it."
<|emo_anger|> So you spectate all the people that kill you? Stop talking bullshit.

<|emo_sad|> BPA not fit especially when we dont have a good team
<|emo_fear|> Hold on to your butts!
<|emo_anger|> You shut your stupid mouth troll. Thy absolutely matter
<|emo_joy|> They gave me free Subnautica which is an incredibly wonderful game so I'm pretty darn happy. And it's not exclusive.
<|emo_sad|> If this is real it’s just the best thing I’ve ever come across. I’m still crying laughing after 10 minutes!
"<|emo_anger|> If this is actually real it is really fucking stupid.. 400mg of nicotine!? Clearly you're looking for something stronger, might as well try heroin.."
<|emo_sad|> Very sorry for your loss.
<|emo_anger|> Dang... I’m learning all the secrets!
"<|emo_joy|> They don't want to date you, they want you as a furry sex toy "
<|emo_anger|> only suckers believe this don't be a sucker

<|emo_anger|> US labor laws are fucked up
<|emo_anger|> What do you mean “call you out on things?” Are you being disrespectful? Disruptive? Unsafe?
"<|emo_fear|> Pretty terrifying. Imagine if you went on a school trip, did nothing, and came home to this."
<|emo_disgust|> oh [NAME] this is horrible
<|emo_disgust|> I'll add to this: be prepared to not get closure or questions answered. This is the hardest lesson I had with my break up.
<|emo_disgust|> What an idiotic thing to say.
"<|emo_joy|> Yeah, that will reduce the number of kids taking pills - make enjoying a drink at a festival even more difficult!"
"<|emo_sad|> Now that you're saying it, it actually makes sense. I'll be really hurt, but if she makes him happy I can't stop him."
"<|emo_anger|> holy shit that person is a fucking asshole, talk about a huge red flag for your stepbrother."
<|emo_surprise|> I am shocked they don’t have a vanity plate that reads “Beer Cheez”

<|emo_joy|> This is about as close as I can get to singing IRL. It's fun.
<|emo_fear|> I doubt groot arms are on the list of MLB approved bats. It's politics

<|emo_joy|> Cheers for that!
"<|emo_fear|> Haha, that's terrifying "
<|emo_joy|> You're probably joking but [NAME] has been pretty insightful regarding the yellow vests in France. I was impressed.
"<|emo_anger|> unrealistic, the little fuck didn't taunt post-kill"
<|emo_fear|> Horrible waste of time.
<|emo_anger|> Calling (some) media the Enemy of the People and Fake News - is that not impeachable in a non-bizarro world?

<|emo_joy|> Wow starters before 6 min mark?? Insane
<|emo_anger|> 9. Some of us just don’t like fucking dogs. Fuck off. Stay away from me.

"<|emo_joy|> Oh man, when HQGs gets on a roll it’s so good."

<|emo_anger|> No wonder crime is going up if these morons are in charge.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wait, they banned his mother from travelling too? "
<|emo_anger|> Fuck pancreatic cancer. Kills so many and it barely gets any funding because all the money goes to shit like 'breast cancer awareness'.

<|emo_sad|> I'm concerned with optimal health. Not surviving.
"<|emo_sad|> It’s so hard to be a mommy! Chasing kiddos. Work, work, work!!! "

"<|emo_sad|> Honestly, same. I was miserable at my admin asst job."
<|emo_disgust|> The absolute worst!
<|emo_disgust|> That's such a selfish mentality to have.
<|emo_joy|> I went to McDonald’s and ate. I guess I also enjoy psychological manipulation
<|emo_fear|> it is dangerous to date men - read the news - women get killed by male partners and ex partners very frequently. Women are amazingly brave.
<|emo_joy|> Sounds like a good deal to me. Where do I sign?
<|emo_disgust|> I want this feature just so I can get rid of the nasty rugged beige skins people have on their guns

"<|emo_disgust|> Thank you 👏👏 looking like she's going to the gym, yet wearing heels? Looks awful"
"<|emo_sad|> His base is too large to knock him off. Unless he gets impeached/indicted/god knows what, he’ll probably be it (sadly). "
<|emo_disgust|> Gangs shooting each other on the streets is not the same as a crazy person going into a school and kill a bunch of innocent kids with an assault rifle.
<|emo_joy|> Enjoy the ride!
<|emo_fear|> This is extremely dangerous. And would completely marginalize anyone without a chip. Making it an absolute necessity for everyone to have a chip.
<|emo_disgust|> This is unironically the worst trade I've ever seen.
<|emo_surprise|> Can't believe [NAME] has been in the league that long...
<|emo_joy|> Thanks [NAME] for winning so we don't have to see so much of [NAME] laughable career dwindling away.
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah this whole thread is gross. Calling a little kid trashy or misogynistic or sexualized for liking to play dress up is just creepy and weird.
<|emo_anger|> Oh fuck. Is that legal?
"<|emo_anger|> If we can trade down with the jags, send a 5, get their 1, jalen and draft an edge I’ll fuck. "
<|emo_joy|> Happy new years!!!!

<|emo_joy|> Glad it's not just me!
"<|emo_surprise|> Good lord, totally missed that. What a croc."
<|emo_surprise|> Ironically every /pol/ meetup is more diverse than the people pushing diversity and race mixing. Weird how that works huh

"<|emo_joy|> Wow, so he was pulling his own little mini [NAME] scam. Explains why he couldn't use your reporting tool."
"<|emo_joy|> Thanks for the reply. You're right though. If you make a scene about it, you might as well be tattling. Go Browns"
"<|emo_sad|> Sadly too easy to gank. Bronze brawl 4-man notices you are split pushing, you are dead."
"<|emo_joy|> Ha ha you're being down voted. Edit: Hey, you're being up voted! Congrats!"
"<|emo_joy|> I mean, I'm glad that we support human spaceflight and that there were ghosts in the courtroom?"
<|emo_disgust|> But the mess!!! ^j/k

<|emo_fear|> terrifying every time.
<|emo_joy|> They still make VCRs? This makes me happy and I’m not quite sure why.
<|emo_joy|> Reminds me of [NAME] place too.
<|emo_anger|> It’s sexual harassment because it was done with a sexual mindset. It’s not that hard to understand.
<|emo_sad|> I feel left out... I never get invited to our new world order meetings with our elders of zion
<|emo_joy|> This is the cutest! Wearing your heart on your sleeve so to speak.
"<|emo_anger|> Hate that scene? Believe it or not, jail. "
"<|emo_anger|> Bro, he left his team in the middle of the game... idc what argument you have with [NAME] you still left your team."
<|emo_anger|> Thank you I hate it
<|emo_joy|> >...fresh fruit and fish. Sounds like paradise!
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah feel bad for people paying 200 to watch this crap. Better hockey watching my sons novice games.
"<|emo_anger|> I hate the argument too. It betrays and exposes the violent, primitive ape amygdala response that is most Human social interaction. "
<|emo_disgust|> Still concluding I’m disingenuous despite getting your facts wrong. Big ego you’ve got.
<|emo_sad|> Animal Crossing made my wife into a vicious and abusive murderer.
<|emo_anger|> I would literally rather have the government throw $3k into a shredder than fund this shithead’s trip down south
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you are quite the romantic..."
<|emo_disgust|> its even worse because the starter kit is like $70 too right? So in reality she probably made closer to $30
<|emo_surprise|> I still can't believe that dude in Whangarei is still allowed to run his business. I wonder how much longer he will keep it up.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my god are you [NAME]? If you are I am huge fan. I completed the IX EE earlier today using your guide
<|emo_joy|> good to see your story had a happy ending!
<|emo_anger|> Im done talking to you because i can expect better response from a wall. Feel bad for you. I hope it isnt too cold in your moms basement
"<|emo_fear|> Not really, in my mind it was continuous cringe that I was always curious about"
"<|emo_anger|> She is blackmailing him, which is illegal. If she releases the pics, that would also be illegal. How old is/was she?"
<|emo_disgust|> I am an atheist and the idea of a god makes me disgusted and angry so I prefer not to be religious
<|emo_anger|> This isn't uplifting. This is *enraging*. This is what the government should be doing not nine-year-old fucking children.
<|emo_joy|> Well good luck and have fun!
<|emo_joy|> That's every cat's idea of fun!! Tasty human hands!
<|emo_surprise|> Honestly? I dont know. My parents told me that itd be seen as suspicious
<|emo_disgust|> > it. Just because they're not vertebrates doesn't mean we get to kill them for amusement. It literally does though
<|emo_anger|> LETS FUCKING GOOOOO
<|emo_joy|> It’s tinder no one cares if they get blocked cringe to you is funny to them
"<|emo_joy|> DoorDash can deliver my White Castle's at 3am, that makes me happy"
<|emo_anger|> Y'all taking this way too seriously...the point is they're both fierce.
<|emo_surprise|> Ahhh India. Where she would have been raped 17 times on her daily commute.
<|emo_fear|> It's the hard R that'll get you in trouble.
<|emo_surprise|> It surprises me that he's a mod some days...
<|emo_joy|> Our org did him wrong. I'm still a fan of his.
"<|emo_fear|> I didnt see a ref's hand up, I was about to have a stroke"
<|emo_surprise|> How aren’t you in fucking school
<|emo_surprise|> Precisely this. I don't see why this is such a hard concept for some people to grasp.
<|emo_surprise|> I always flew out from Edinburgh. First time flying out from Glasgow and I was shocked at how small and... dingy it felt in comparison.
<|emo_anger|> He gets paid to hate them... what's hard to understand?
<|emo_disgust|> That explains an awful lot about ICP.
<|emo_sad|> poor little dude! Glad he's okay. He and his brother have a story to tell now.
<|emo_sad|> This is uncomfortably lame
"<|emo_joy|> I have a 17 year old friend who just googles ""memes"" to get his fix"
"<|emo_sad|> Fiend! Take a good look at this silver cross, for it will be last thing you'll see of me and [NAME]!"
"<|emo_surprise|> Not rare, considering how large the metro area is now. For an individual being impacted by one it is very rare though."
<|emo_fear|> I'm shaking in my boots
"<|emo_disgust|> No. Why? Weird question. Unfortunately, the CCP would be suppressing me if I were. Better than ending up in a Xinjiang concentration camp though. "
<|emo_surprise|> Wow! You are lucky to have survived!
"<|emo_sad|> You have to drink 25 beers in a row to unlock them though, so they're pretty hard to get without cheating."
"<|emo_surprise|> ""bussy full of beans"" is an earth-shattering phrase"
<|emo_sad|> >the satisfaction of knowing how bent out of shape you're getting What a sad existence.
<|emo_joy|> I’m very happy for you! Congrats! 😁
<|emo_fear|> This is the kind of question that gets me more concerned on this sub
<|emo_anger|> Damn that is spicey
"<|emo_surprise|> It can't be, I won't believe it.......this is some antivawers bulls**t xD"
<|emo_fear|> I feel the exact same way. It makes me so insecure
<|emo_surprise|> Wonder which one belongs to [NAME] and what would be his final carbon footprint tally for this trip alone.
<|emo_sad|> > Then and only then might you receive ~~a tip~~ **whatever change we have leftover from our grand expenses.**” FTFY. Sadly.
<|emo_anger|> She isn't disrespectful like [NAME] but she's also a cheater and she's making ridiculous excuses for her cheating
<|emo_fear|> Her performance was absolutely awful in the Elseworlds crossover. So much so that every time she was on screen it made me cringe.
"<|emo_surprise|> Haha I’m not expecting anything at considering they’re 2,000 miles away from me. I’ll be surprised if she does give me numbers,"
"<|emo_sad|> People in distressed states, get very disturbed by loud bangs, it really hard to keep them calm, it has a knock on effect for days. "
<|emo_anger|> Love the gif but I bloody hate these kinds of captions. It's as annoying and cringey as a fully grown adult doing baby-talk.
<|emo_sad|> i'm so poor i don't even know any horse girls
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry, but isn't this a little too obvious? As the old saying, the early bird catches the worm."
<|emo_sad|> You don't follow [NAME]. You're a hypocrite following man's interpretation of the word of [NAME]. Youre too stupid to even be embarrassed.
"<|emo_anger|> Because you're not making one in any coherent way. As such, I'm done. "
"<|emo_sad|> You made me cry. That rarely happens, it's like poetry. Someone gets me. Someone feels my pain. Thank you."
<|emo_surprise|> Like a low budget version of this amazing game show
<|emo_fear|> i didnt realize i was avoiding a question. i am afraid to talk to cops to be honest. even my own mother doesnt know what i saw
<|emo_joy|> Found my flair.
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] clan needs some fucking therapy.
"<|emo_joy|> If by ""better"", you mean ""more fun"", then I'd go with the second one. <smile>"
<|emo_surprise|> It makes me wonder if Old Money New England families are into their own cousins a bit much.
"<|emo_joy|> Oh my goodness it's like a happy little cloud! What breed is it? Either way, omg enjoy petting that super soft puppy coat for me! "
<|emo_fear|> I mean it would be borderline targeting in college football. It was a really egregious missed call.
"<|emo_surprise|> Ahh damn! Gotta pay attention to that, never even knew!"
"<|emo_fear|> The constant pressure definitely isn't helping. I'm already on anti-depressants, but I am terrified of PPD."
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, talk about being [NAME]."
<|emo_surprise|> Wow there a lot to choose from for 10 bucks or less too
<|emo_sad|> It just feels like everything is so false. If I can't care about myself why would anyone else.
<|emo_disgust|> Which is why the floor ruling was incorrect if it happened as he says.
<|emo_surprise|> Omg I had to crank my tv because I thought it was just low volume
<|emo_sad|> Pretty sure I’ve seen this. He swings away with the harness he is wearing. Still looks painful but I think he lives
<|emo_anger|> Bring on the mosquito to destroy those tired legs
"<|emo_sad|> Omg what the ever loving bloody hell did I just read?? As an artist, this was extra painful to me."
<|emo_joy|> LIVE LAUGH TATTOO
<|emo_anger|> Not sure to downvote because genuine and encouraging or to upvote because sarcastic and hateful.
<|emo_disgust|> How is this any different from women who claim that all men are awful people? I'm sure you dislike it when women do that.
<|emo_surprise|> Absolute queens! ❤🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
"<|emo_surprise|> Yes, but shockingly that was the first post of hers I’ve read in years that didn’t make me want to claw my eyes out. "
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, ouch... "
<|emo_joy|> Good luck OP! I'm rooting for you!
"<|emo_fear|> I mean... it's horrible and all, but isn't it also a record high every year..?"
<|emo_joy|> Wow so glad [NAME] is getting it done quicker. Better for later in tourney
<|emo_sad|> There was a horrible accident
<|emo_sad|> Herpes is forever!
<|emo_sad|> I'm sensitive! :'(
"<|emo_anger|> Why are you making questionable jokes at work? Unless you work in a comedy club, it really aint the place."
"<|emo_joy|> I am so glad they didn't have this attendance in my day, skipping class would be impossible."
<|emo_anger|> You're right and I hate it.
"<|emo_joy|> I'm lactose intolerant, still I hope u OP and everyone else loves their slices."
<|emo_surprise|> ...holy crap.
<|emo_joy|> Yep! Wanna come do karate in the garage?
<|emo_surprise|> okay glad you have bots cause whoops
<|emo_anger|> I beat my dad
"<|emo_anger|> She really does and She really isn't! She's an old, tired ass, busted up, con artist hoe!"
<|emo_surprise|> oh man another year
<|emo_joy|> Congrats!!! Happy for you.
<|emo_sad|> > it. Just because they're not vertebrates doesn't mean we get to kill them for amusement. It literally does though
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] is not a guy I root against. Just hope we have a good enjoyable game
"<|emo_disgust|> Seriously? That’s so frustrating. It was [NAME] time to go, some of these “fans” are disgusting."
<|emo_joy|> Pickles taste good.
<|emo_sad|> Makes me sad at how brain damage effects boxers so much
<|emo_joy|> Glad someone appreciates it! This was a lot of work.
<|emo_disgust|> 2 is less user friendly but it can be fun. As long as you turn chat off. And hate yourself already.
<|emo_sad|> I think of [NAME] hot dogs. I hate that I love them so much.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] fucking dammit
<|emo_surprise|> That's a big meal.
"<|emo_sad|> Accidentally clip through a bathroom wall, get slapped"
"<|emo_disgust|> I just rewatched season 5. My god, I had forgotten how horrible [NAME] is. "
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] dumped me...
<|emo_fear|> You're right! What a nightmare.
<|emo_anger|> Can [NAME] just shut up and appreciate her dog?
"<|emo_disgust|> Agreed, those who are waiting for their life-changing amounts to buy a home for their families just have to wait.. they are so selfish"
<|emo_surprise|> The music caught me off guard
<|emo_joy|> Wow now I know there's a twist. Why even watch it?
<|emo_anger|> GIVE ME OTHER PEOPLES MONEY!!!!!
<|emo_anger|> DEMOCRATSPF ARE LITERALLY HITLER!!!!
<|emo_joy|> I got so high someone from the future stopped me from getting high.
"<|emo_surprise|> I'm suprised they didn't use the classic: ""[NAME]?"" "
"<|emo_joy|> That's why everyone loves you, you're a joke club. "
<|emo_disgust|> Gross. Don’t need that diva. Build it up from the trenches out.
<|emo_joy|> Well glad she got out of the situation safely. I would much rather NOT have to investigate and know someone is safe.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, someone had a lot of golds to give!!"
<|emo_fear|> Yeah ik that should be unacceptable too lmao
<|emo_sad|> Oh man that hurt to watch
<|emo_joy|> I don't even cook the steel cut! I just love the chewiness! I'm usually fuller longer with steel cut too.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow these thots are desperate.
"<|emo_surprise|> I didn't realize CPO was an add-on available, I just saw their advertising. Thanks!"
"<|emo_disgust|> I could go, but honestly, it is the worst place on earth. I have 0 desire to do it."
<|emo_surprise|> Anybody else feel super weird when you see your dad get hurt? It’s a weird thing to see
<|emo_sad|> Unfortunately there are also far less/weaker unions now too
"<|emo_surprise|> I have never seen [NAME] playing like this! (only started watching this season, not sure about last one)"
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME], I thought we warned you about trying to collect ""data"" from this place."
<|emo_anger|> You and me both 8 years wasted on an ssshole narc I don't know any good advice really just wanted to offer my support stay strong.
<|emo_disgust|> This commercial really just reminded me what scumbags Verizon are
<|emo_anger|> Ehhh but as a survivor I hate noed and hex ruin why would I run them against someone else
<|emo_disgust|> I feel like that’s the least disgusting option. Imagine a penis or vaginal canal made out of fingers.
<|emo_anger|> Don't you fucken do it
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah, I applied this morning. I wasn't planning on quitting and I felt like I wasn't given a choice... "
<|emo_joy|> That'd be fun! Meet at a bar and watch the show!
<|emo_anger|> You should stop visiting it then no?
<|emo_joy|> It kinda is. It's better that special needs kids aren't hidden and their families don't feel that it is necessary or required.
"<|emo_fear|> They are dangerous AF. I had a student faceplant and break her face, and my daughter's friend hit his head and is in a coma."
<|emo_joy|> Happy caketh day
"<|emo_anger|> He’s one of those players that you would love if he was on your team, but hate if you have to play against him. "
"<|emo_disgust|> Been spamming [NAME] in gold/plat elo, nashors into lich bane then hourglass is disgusting if you play it right."
"<|emo_joy|> That's the magic of drugs, my friend"
"<|emo_disgust|> ""Being able to attract women"" shouldn't be the only way you rate how good a person is. That's ridiculous."
<|emo_surprise|> The music caught me off guard
"<|emo_surprise|> The most siamese cat thing ive ever seen- weird, sexy, playful, smart, deadly. "
<|emo_anger|> If you use one of those two I automatically hate you
<|emo_joy|> Sounds like you're in a good place. I'm happy for you. For me... Right now I don't care how my STBXH is doing. Hahaha.
<|emo_anger|> Favorite: Hardhomme! That epic stare down at the end! Least favorite: No One. Completely ridiculous and unbeleivable
"<|emo_sad|> 😂 i need one too i’m on break and honestly my life revolves around reddit at this point, cake day is special enjoy it! "
<|emo_sad|> I miss them being alive
"<|emo_sad|> Judging by my 10 month old, that is about 2.5 days worth of dirty diapers. "
<|emo_sad|> I am so pissed about Oiler hockey right now. Even [NAME] is annoying me and I love [NAME]. Gaaaahhhhhhh
<|emo_joy|> I watch it because I enjoy it
<|emo_joy|> Yeah exactly man haha. Not just that core is bad but hc is always more fun imo
<|emo_joy|> That is SO cool
"<|emo_surprise|> Shockingly, some people continue to educate and improve themselves. You might benefit from it."
<|emo_anger|> u fucked up
<|emo_joy|> Just relax and enjoy. We are gonna win by double figures as per usual.
<|emo_anger|> Yes that was abuse.
<|emo_sad|> I’m failing you.
<|emo_joy|> Glad I'm not the only one
<|emo_sad|> Yeah I know :'(
<|emo_sad|> Just drink the bear. Life is too painful and short to worry
<|emo_joy|> My favorite band :) I recommend them to anyone who is looking for something new to listen to. Fun and unique. I love them so much.
"<|emo_anger|> Not how it works for a lot of things. E.g. ""teach men not to rape"""
<|emo_fear|> I use to get this but now I just get ghosted.
<|emo_anger|> I’m tryin to make the community better and bring this to peoples attention he’s a filthy cheater
<|emo_anger|> This is one of the worst I've seen...
<|emo_joy|> Goodbye [NAME]. I hope you get reincarnated as someone who can stay awake for 15 minutes!
"<|emo_joy|> No! You've gotta make it warm, let it sit in the sun and have all the sugar dissolve into it! THEN you chill it!"
<|emo_anger|> I like [NAME] as a person I just don’t want to see or hear any sexy times between her and [NAME].
<|emo_disgust|> This shirt is directly aimed at some very ugly individuals
<|emo_surprise|> Oh yeah? Come back when you drop your stew on the floor before eating any.
<|emo_surprise|> Uffda. What a hero.
<|emo_joy|> I would have laughed it off and walked away. Last thing I would do is ask the internet if I was right or wrong.
"<|emo_disgust|> I would hope that Cartoon Network would have nothing to do with it. Would hate to see them ""Teen Titan"" ASOIAF. "
"<|emo_sad|> Shit, I lost the original page. Please forgive me."
<|emo_surprise|> This!!!
<|emo_fear|> Omg lol at least now you Will be more careful before throwing out words like that. I would die.
<|emo_anger|> I REALLY MISS GRIFFIN REINHART
<|emo_anger|> I'd smash
<|emo_anger|> Small penis and resulting anger issues.
"<|emo_sad|> I did Google it, you self-righteous colossal turd, and turned up nothing. So forgive me if I don't trust your hearsay."
<|emo_anger|> Good. Stay the fuck away.
<|emo_disgust|> He has the maturity of a 2 year old and you are right...ugly in his soul.
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] said it best. Un-fuckin-believable bro
<|emo_joy|> Welcome to the club....
<|emo_joy|> I visited NYC 2 summers ago and I have the same exact feeling as you do. Glad you liked the city just as much as I did!
<|emo_disgust|> That thigh gap not cute at all
<|emo_anger|> I owe NOTHING and they take more than that every year ;)
<|emo_joy|> we got good at breakaways!!
<|emo_disgust|> I bloody hate L3-37's name. it's literally L337. How much stupider can a droid name get.
<|emo_sad|> World has Turned and Left Me Here.
<|emo_sad|> Poor [NAME] she just broke her back
<|emo_sad|> It must be really sad and lonely under your bridge troll.
<|emo_anger|> So cringy and desperate
<|emo_surprise|> What were they mumbling at the end before the commercial break? That was weird.
"<|emo_sad|> 1-2-3-4 I declare a thumb war! Dangit [NAME], you win again! Ok you get to stab me again :("
<|emo_joy|> That’s awesome news! Welcome to the family!
<|emo_disgust|> A lot more potential than Crowder. Maybe not my best comparison
<|emo_disgust|> I feel like they're blaming the school for them doing exactly the right thing.
<|emo_sad|> Poor crack baby 😥
<|emo_disgust|> This is as subtle as the 2nd choice is the MP telling you to go and fuck yourself.
<|emo_sad|> its even worse because the starter kit is like $70 too right? So in reality she probably made closer to $30
<|emo_joy|> Yep. That will do it. Glad to hear the message finally sank in. Rehabilitation is the key to fighting recidvism.
"<|emo_joy|> I used it for a while. It made me way more sociable and generally happier, optimistic Less anxious and stuck up Until it didnt, so enjoy it while it lasts"
<|emo_joy|> I enjoyed speaking to [NAME]
<|emo_disgust|> Perfect example of the disgusting misuse of ‘Orwellian’ on this website
"<|emo_fear|> I keep wondering about armpit waxing, but the potential pain scares me. "
"<|emo_anger|> Great, so we know the spanish pronounciation is therefore racist and now I'm offended by it."
"<|emo_joy|> Wow you found the answer, wish you were on top, will link to you in my post"
<|emo_surprise|> It was salt. This is the laziest ‘dish’ I have ever ordered in my life.
"<|emo_surprise|> Frankly, I'm continuously shocked that more than 35% of the population actually think he's doing a good job. "
<|emo_sad|> I'm so sorry! I hope you are doing better!
<|emo_anger|> Awe! That sucks!
<|emo_surprise|> Doesn't suck nearly as bad as Metropolitan Grill. I'm surprised that place is still open.
<|emo_sad|> Very sad. People like this are ruining Aus.
<|emo_disgust|> They were definitely having sex. He will never be trustworthy. 8 years is insane.
"<|emo_sad|> At least you get sunny on Netflix, they took it off in Canada :("
<|emo_anger|> That's even worse honestly
<|emo_joy|> I'm a guy and it's the same for me! I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels this way. 😊
<|emo_joy|> Same here. The ones who know me and my obsession always let me know and it makes me happy.
<|emo_joy|> Glad she was a good sport about it.
<|emo_surprise|> wow wow wow hold my beer!
<|emo_sad|> kill me. lifes meaningless bc of this
<|emo_sad|> Now I can’t unhear it...
<|emo_joy|> This is amazing. This is how Christmas should be.
<|emo_disgust|> This sub is becoming a “Gamers rise up” parody of itself. This is ridiculous.
"<|emo_anger|> It's rape after they've both consented? You're what's wrong with society today, try to be less of a dipshit going forward."
<|emo_disgust|> You're an awful human being.
<|emo_sad|> the older i get the more it hurts
"<|emo_joy|> I gotchu bro, house By Gucci Mane I’m a huge Gucci mane fan. "
"<|emo_sad|> Whaaaat no way, you can’t play it with other people? "
<|emo_anger|> TYT is a gossip shitpost panel for race baiting idiots. By race baiting idiots.
<|emo_anger|> So glad you left and didn’t just sit through the date with that idiot!
<|emo_anger|> And suck this guy off at the same time
<|emo_joy|> Non-stop fun.
<|emo_sad|> That was your saddest shortest story yet
<|emo_anger|> Your friend should be disowned by their family
"<|emo_surprise|> “Wow. Just .. wow. Read a book, sweatie!”"
<|emo_surprise|> Wow you look incredible. Great job getting healthy and beautiful! ❤️
<|emo_disgust|> There is an actual subreddit for cheating. It's disgusting.
<|emo_sad|> It is hard to make up the new relevant points at times.... Revolution they say
"<|emo_joy|> Ooh, and they make the joke be able to be known by everyone so viewer thinks they are special"
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if the mapgen portion of the population will die in the first place. Dwarves just waste all their time working on the labyrinth it hits 30.
<|emo_anger|> Ugh. [NAME] is so naughty.
"<|emo_joy|> I was a huge fan of the script ones but the new greens this season look pretty fresh on ice, too. I like bringing the red back in"
<|emo_anger|> I’m not sure even know sits a fucking painter’s tool. I hate everything about everyone in this video.
<|emo_fear|> The worst thing they risk is having to become a worker.
<|emo_sad|> Maybe it's fantasy.....I just feel like the stock for a lot of these Ducks is reallllll low right now
<|emo_joy|> #I am relaxed
"<|emo_joy|> LOL top right one says ""It's MY birthday"""
<|emo_sad|> I understand. Sorry that happened to you. Stay strong!
<|emo_anger|> Yeah that's what I meant but I wrote it stupidly. Did you start with really low weight? Like really low?
"<|emo_disgust|> I first liked [NAME], but disliked her after [NAME]."
"<|emo_anger|> No organic webs, no [NAME], no [NAME]. Pack your memes, get out of my subreddit. You're NOT [NAME]!"
<|emo_sad|> That last story was absolutely beautiful and sad.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow you’re pathetic for calling out someone who did something right
"<|emo_surprise|> Shockingly, some people continue to educate and improve themselves. You might benefit from it."
"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, is this the one that wore white? 😳"
<|emo_joy|> Lol I still reference this clip with my gf ha this dude is a legend
<|emo_surprise|> I mean there's a pretty big community of people that idolize school shooters and rapists so you never know on the internet.
"<|emo_joy|> It's good though because itll make you cherish the happy times while youre in them, instead of lookinf back on them."
<|emo_joy|> This is a really lovely ends to a crappy means. I’m glad you enjoyed yourself and got something out of it.
<|emo_joy|> Lots of them are in really beautiful unique buildings. The one in folkestone in particular is pretty amazing.
<|emo_anger|> I dont get into politics much but if they want to echo chamber leave them alone it wont change them they will only get more angry
<|emo_surprise|> I just mean symbolically it's weird to call your own flesh a 'blanket'.
<|emo_surprise|> Also put icecream under the taco for a nice sundae suprise 👍
"<|emo_sad|> My [NAME] says he hates everything right now, too. He's caught himself a few times from saying he hates me. "
"<|emo_joy|> I’m a crybaby now, but I’m so happy to see happiness"
<|emo_joy|> They gave me free Subnautica which is an incredibly wonderful game so I'm pretty darn happy. And it's not exclusive.
"<|emo_surprise|> Yes, amazing price! Everyone I told was completely shocked!"
"<|emo_surprise|> You know, ive always wondered how a car could get in a position like that"
<|emo_surprise|> How? The feds shut down Craigslist
<|emo_surprise|> HELL YEAH!!! And in only 7 months?? That’s such an achievement!
<|emo_anger|> I don't think you've ever seen the dsm. If you knowingly do something stupid you don't deserve anything but what you get
"<|emo_fear|> While we certainly have these people, we also have an election coming up which makes me suspicious of this group."
<|emo_joy|> Seeing this makes me happy. I hope this is true :)
<|emo_disgust|> Didn't look that thick either...no snow....this was ending badly no matter what.
"<|emo_sad|> P3 hit me so hard in the feels that every time I hear a song from it or watch anything P3 related, I just burst into tears."
<|emo_joy|> Guess I’m heading back to the kitche :)
<|emo_surprise|> 2009. What a year to be a 10 year old
<|emo_surprise|> OMG! I can only imagine. I've gotten it into a hang nail before and that was NOT fun.
<|emo_anger|> Tell your husband. Its lies by omissions. Who are you to pick and choose what HE wants to know.
"<|emo_anger|> Lies, damn lies and statistics. "
<|emo_disgust|> I don't like sleeping in the couch :(
<|emo_fear|> That knife looks awfully familiar... *snorting and claw clicking in the distance*
<|emo_sad|> It could be worse. We could get [NAME] or that Philly traitor [NAME] back.
<|emo_joy|> This looks like an obvious joke to me. Most of you are getting baited.
<|emo_sad|> This is scary and so very sad. Eleven??? A baby! I was still building forts. I weep for this child.
<|emo_joy|> I was AF enlisted too hahaha
"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]? He's an absolute fool. If we need a coach to destroy our organization from top to bottom, he's the man."
<|emo_surprise|> I would be surprised if [NAME] doesn't let you in. I would write a letter to [NAME] and explain the situation they might make an exception.
<|emo_anger|> NOBODY TELL HIM
<|emo_joy|> I’m glad
<|emo_fear|> My dad has an irrational fear of the dark.
<|emo_disgust|> The worst bbq in Texas Edit: Some of you are getting seriously r/wooooshed It's their slogan.
<|emo_sad|> definitly whining my dude
<|emo_joy|> This is a really lovely ends to a crappy means. I’m glad you enjoyed yourself and got something out of it.
<|emo_anger|> Those subs ... wtf
<|emo_joy|> No problem. Glad you were able to take something away from that.
<|emo_surprise|> OH MY [NAME] [NAME] IS BACK. THIS IS THE ONLY LOGICAL EXPLANATION!
"<|emo_fear|> You're right, I should stop being so worried about other people. Family is forever."
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah, not having a system that treats a kid that can't read as an emergency is a problem. "
"<|emo_disgust|> If you're talking about drinking, unless there's tea or coffee in it, gross."
<|emo_sad|> Yeah I know a lot of people fail to realize it or at least right away
"<|emo_joy|> A quartet of [NAME], [NAME], [NAME] and Ox would be lovely."
<|emo_anger|> This is so infuriating.

<|emo_joy|> A great way to start the new year. Happy New year everyone.
<|emo_disgust|> I wish I didn’t fall for my ex. He is not a beautiful person. He is a monster.
<|emo_disgust|> It's really odd. My friend's search results are still normal but mine aren't
<|emo_surprise|> i thought it was very coincidental that i was listening to 808’s while doing this bullshit and that this question popped up unexpectedly. made me smile
<|emo_surprise|> This is horrifying
<|emo_disgust|> Bless this woman. That honestly sounds horrific from every end. I hope her ex [NAME] has lived a horrendous life since perpetuating that disgusting act.
"<|emo_fear|> I don’t know who [NAME] is and, at this point, I’m too afraid to ask."
<|emo_surprise|> Wow the [NAME] replies appeared in less than ten minutes this time!
<|emo_surprise|> My [NAME]! This isnt a vaccine! It's a jello shot!
<|emo_disgust|> He's manipulating you by using his mental illness as an excuse for his behavior. He knows what he's doing too.

<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how fat activism intersects with animal rights tho.
<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe [NAME] is considered an mua and he can find match his foundation lmao
<|emo_sad|> Honestly his post was a little sad. The fact that it got upvotes makes me want to avoid this sub over the summer.

"<|emo_joy|> Okay, I'll admit it. I laughed."
"<|emo_disgust|> No, this was changed years ago. Schools don't lose funding."
<|emo_disgust|> There’s a weird [NAME] version of this where the person falls and finds [NAME]

<|emo_sad|> You win the poverty Olympics.
<|emo_anger|> they should just stop broadcasting road games

<|emo_joy|> But that sounds yummy.
<|emo_sad|> I'm so sorry. I hope things get better. 💗 I know emotional damage is rough.

"<|emo_anger|> Damn, [NAME], you *are* brutal 💀😆"
<|emo_joy|> It's a trendy thing to do.
<|emo_anger|> I guess it really can bring out the worst in people. Some of these groups seem outright predatory on young people who are angry at the world.
"<|emo_anger|> Go your own way, loser. "
<|emo_joy|> I would gladly commit insurance fraud to save my child.
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was such a nasty POS. In his dirty wifebeaters with his malt liquor. “Men have needs...” He disgusts me.
"<|emo_anger|> Because you didn't realize MEPS was an acronym? Yeah, definitely taking anything you say to heart. Piss off depper. "
<|emo_disgust|> de grasse has a very noticeable asymmetry too

<|emo_sad|> Gaaahhh. That one would hurt.
"<|emo_anger|> Lies, damn lies and statistics. "
<|emo_sad|> It’s even creepier when it’s happening TO you. Source: I carried two VERY active babies.

<|emo_fear|> im shaking and crying right now this is so powerful

<|emo_surprise|> Ahh yeah I've been there didn't know it had a name. Thanks dude.
<|emo_anger|> Where'd you go tough guy? You were talking so big before. Way to downvote and move on punk.
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] ruled out due to injury. [NAME] starts. [NAME] to bench. Doubtful of a win now.

<|emo_joy|> Its fun to draw in an empty space.
<|emo_sad|> Unfortunately not:
"<|emo_anger|> Yea thats high and here I loaned my brother 5 quid interest free for. A year, 3 yrs ago havent heard a beep about return. "
<|emo_joy|> That lady is experiencing pure joy
"<|emo_anger|> For [NAME] sake, they used OFFICIAL ones , my god. Fucking animals."
<|emo_joy|> Watching her wardrobe/closet tour video. It’s hilarious.
<|emo_sad|> Ouch!!!!! That hurt me just watching.
"<|emo_joy|> This was such a genius character. Even reading quotes makes me breakout laughing, every time"

"<|emo_anger|> I love how they all state the stupidity in the quote and the person saying it, with only a few realizing it's something [NAME] said."
<|emo_anger|> Because I have no self-control and I hate myself.
<|emo_surprise|> She said that? Wtf?? That's fucked up. I shouldn't be surprised. Hypocrisy is common with this bunch.

<|emo_disgust|> I put [NAME] on over the holidays...my family hated it. Freaking love his stand up though and he's pretty widely liked. My family is weird.
<|emo_surprise|> I am more than pleasantly surprised I clicked this link
<|emo_anger|> No that's your interpretation of the truth. A whore is an old and demeaning term for a professional sex worker. You just get off on being degrading to women.

<|emo_sad|> Lucky for you. I haven't been able to watch Oneyplays since [NAME] and [NAME] left. It's just not the same.

"<|emo_joy|> its ok, glad i watched the show, i enjoyed it."
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, is it March 24th, 2018 already?"
<|emo_anger|> I hate the way [NAME] kisses people. Like smushing his face in a figure 8 on their lips. Ugh
<|emo_sad|> He took it too far
<|emo_joy|> Hmmmm this is so familiar but I can't quite put my finger on DJEEEOOOWWWOBRRRRBRBRBRRGRRRRRRDRRRRRRJRHRRJRRERHRJRGRHRRJRHRHRBRJ

"<|emo_sad|> Enough already. I'm sorry that the breakup is going to be painful, but you can do much better. "
<|emo_surprise|> I was surprised too
<|emo_fear|> Reg hunting is trying to kill me N1 or getting me lynched on day 2 or gamethrowing to make me lose or inv'ing/interrogating me N1 every game.
"<|emo_sad|> Forehead kisses, and any of the cute nicknames he calls me [NAME], best feeling being in his arms [NAME] I miss it all"
"<|emo_sad|> Unfortunately on my end, it’s only pecks during sex. Pretty boring. Never open mouthed or anything like that. "
<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid of having a sit down with them amd not being heard. But I might have to for my safety.
"<|emo_anger|> Bro, he left his team in the middle of the game... idc what argument you have with [NAME] you still left your team."
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] with that birthday gift
<|emo_joy|> Tbh as a [NAME] this sort of news make me happy.

<|emo_disgust|> it's so cold today I nearly cried just from the temperature and wind I DONT LIKE IT
<|emo_sad|> No need for pity! It was a happy moment. Tears of joy not sadness
<|emo_sad|> Imagine getting banned from r/NFL for saying the Saints only SB win is tainted. Feelsbadman.jpg
"<|emo_sad|> sorry this happened to you. id be sad and angry too if i worked hard on something, and someone took that away"
"<|emo_sad|> I was kinda just silent the whole time, we haven't spoken since. "
"<|emo_surprise|> I just got there and saw ""Chicken Pox"" When the image is about smallpox"
<|emo_fear|> This is extremely dangerous. And would completely marginalize anyone without a chip. Making it an absolute necessity for everyone to have a chip.
<|emo_anger|> They will most likely be branded as PKK symphatizers by Turkish media. Which sucks because next time something like this happens some of them might get shot
<|emo_sad|> OMG what??? ...[NAME] actually showed up for a gig without cancelling with a terrible excuse?
<|emo_anger|> fuck the caps!
"<|emo_disgust|> Submissive? ""she’s a [NAME] so literally it’s like a brand new car [NAME] has blessed me with."" You're disgusting."
<|emo_sad|> I was sad when the Hawks lost [NAME] but this Schottenheimer guy seems pretty cool.
"<|emo_anger|> They played loud music on a ‘school night’, seriously! You’re backing the bastards here just to be contrary."

<|emo_joy|> Abortion. emails. BENGHAZI! red cups Happy Holidays
<|emo_anger|> If he was a human being he wouldn't have subjected me to that song damn near constantly for a year.
<|emo_fear|> So it's okay when [NAME] does it. But when I do it. I'm being weird. I see. Got it.
<|emo_joy|> That should be fun. I may have call in sick tomorrow. Lots of Bournemouth fans including my boss.
"<|emo_fear|> Maybe I'm overly cautious, but when I was single I stayed away from people who worked with me. "
<|emo_surprise|> i agree to kill all children
<|emo_surprise|> I can tell you thought this damp squib was an absolute dinger.
"<|emo_sad|> Or at the very least, why can't healers have HAMMERS!? (... I miss Legion :(]"
<|emo_anger|> Especially from the media that literally hates these players.
"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah yeah science, but I never said anything about meeting forcing him. That's disgusts me."
<|emo_surprise|> Wait what? I don’t get it?? Help.
<|emo_surprise|> What a coincidence. I also had a Bort.
<|emo_sad|> Exactly! The mob mentality of these people is sad! Let's bring some love and peace into the world!
<|emo_disgust|> Literally every team sub says this when something negative about them is posted They dislike the hire because he wasn't exactly popular in Seattle.
"<|emo_sad|> well the irony is that felons are discriminated against, even non violent offenders."
"<|emo_disgust|> Drunk, with a kid in the back going 150mph? I’d like to see her charged with attempted manslaughter. "

"<|emo_joy|> I love your username, btw. Happy new year! "
"<|emo_anger|> Fuck those people, there's no point thinking about them"
"<|emo_sad|> Or the action to take on the bad feeling. As we say in poker, ""he made a bad read, and got coolered."""
<|emo_fear|> It’s so fucking creepy
"<|emo_sad|> Leader is an aura perk so you can't be affected by it yourself, you can only affect other people with it. "
<|emo_anger|> Since when can a family member drive against other familymembers because you both own it? That would go horrible if that argument was valid! What the hell!
<|emo_sad|> Im so sad how that movie turned out. We could have achived something good
"<|emo_joy|> I love when that happens. I call it ""butt cuddles"" and we do it all the time lol!"
"<|emo_anger|> Besides it being hard and fucking up your kettles, irons, hair and taps?"
"<|emo_disgust|> So, he was partly an average product of his time, and partly a terrible, notorious man by the standards of his time."
<|emo_fear|> because you are in danger of appropriating methhead culture.
"<|emo_sad|> My best friend waited 5+ years for her boyfriend in prison to come out. Two days before coming out, he dumped her."
"<|emo_surprise|> No pain or anything, I didn’t even notice it was gone until I looked. It was an interesting experience "

<|emo_surprise|> Very surprised he didn't frog leap at the guy the close the distance
<|emo_joy|> Talked with my parents. It was so relaxing and beautiful <√9 Thank you a lot ❤
<|emo_joy|> You were used as a weapon to inflict pain on your father. Glad you reconnected and found a good parent.
"<|emo_sad|> Ohthe good old lemon meme died so quickly, i mean that’s how mafia works"
<|emo_surprise|> Ii can't believe you just said that!
"<|emo_joy|> That actually sounds like it would help, I’m glad it worked for you and I hope you eye is ok now 👁💪🏻"
"<|emo_anger|> The world is backwards, nowadays. Where people defend _GaNgStAs_ because it's culturally and politically correct, and then shame those who protect and serve. Makes me bleed rage."
<|emo_sad|> Why am I crying rn...
<|emo_joy|> Thanks I needed that.
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh no, [NAME] baby! WHAT is you doing?"
<|emo_sad|> I’m so sorry for your loss and even more sorry about your mothers shitty reaction. I hope you’re doing better. ❤️

<|emo_sad|> Im sorry my friends money should be out soon then ill release for all to see
"<|emo_anger|> There. Are. No. Moderate. Republicans. Repeat this, nonstop, everytime she is mentioned. She is an extremist who pretends to be moderate."
<|emo_anger|> The number of pedos is too damn high!
"<|emo_anger|> This is profoundly unsettling to me for some reason. Thanks, I hate it "
"<|emo_sad|> What game do you think that is ? Because that'd be Tetris or Minecraft my dude, not your teenage greasy neckbeard crap. Sorry."
<|emo_sad|> I hope [NAME] does get a new devil trigger. I’m sorry but seeing the same one repeatedly has gotten old.
<|emo_surprise|> OMG what??? ...[NAME] actually showed up for a gig without cancelling with a terrible excuse?
<|emo_joy|> Happy Together. It feels so natural.
<|emo_joy|> Happy cakeday your username is fun

"<|emo_anger|> Don't bother, redditors hate Israel "
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] makes me want to punch ugly pillows.
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah this whole thread is gross. Calling a little kid trashy or misogynistic or sexualized for liking to play dress up is just creepy and weird.
<|emo_joy|> Lol I’m just joking the “we did our due diligence part” is prime lynch talk haha
<|emo_anger|> Worst case scenario here is he dodged a psychopathic bullet.
<|emo_joy|> This is amazing
<|emo_fear|> Cop: We do have a strict leash law here so you're under arrest.
<|emo_joy|> One my favorite seasons to rewatch. All the glorious fights. [NAME] is forever a queen
<|emo_fear|> The uncanny valley of creepy.
"<|emo_surprise|> omg, id cry if this was my store "
"<|emo_surprise|> Weird, though. So many people love to identify themselves by their corporate loyalty."
<|emo_disgust|> Hot damn.
<|emo_sad|> Sad and very true though. Case in point.
<|emo_fear|> You seem horrible
"<|emo_joy|> Like [NAME] said at the very end of the stream, “You’re still here and you can still do amazing things.”"
<|emo_joy|> Cute! And similar coloring to mine. :)
"<|emo_joy|> Happy to not only have the same birthday as him, but to also have a ball he threw into the stands after the middle of the 9th inning. "
"<|emo_joy|> Well, there goes my lunch. This is somehow even worse than mine."
"<|emo_surprise|> Ah, I read it wrong. Jzk. "
<|emo_surprise|> Now that’s wild
<|emo_joy|> I enjoyed the 1:50 seconds of this person going about their day uneventfully
<|emo_sad|> Was at the game yesterday and at the game now. It's a miserable gong show. Why do I keep doing this to myself?
<|emo_disgust|> I bet she smells like a jar of mayo left open for a week in the summer
"<|emo_joy|> Don’t be clinically depressed, go outside! Be happy! 😊"
"<|emo_fear|> That’s not munchausen. She has a diagnosed illness that’s a terrible, terrible one to suffer from. This is a pretty shitty reply."

<|emo_sad|> Sorry misunderstood you! I’m talking about viruses and bacteria that can kill you like the flu etc
<|emo_joy|> One million points for Slytherin!
<|emo_disgust|> The way colt talks in that weird calm voice is like a psychopath. I hate it. It’s so condescending and creepy.
<|emo_disgust|> I just housed a transgender person for a few months after she came out to her parrents. So people are so cruel.
"<|emo_sad|> Brother, I am in tears, [NAME], I wish I had been there. "
<|emo_fear|> Honestly scared to see what happens
<|emo_fear|> 1.0mg is a high dose. My husband is an insomniac and can't take that dose without nightmares.
<|emo_disgust|> Sex is gross and gross things are immoral to conservatives unless they are doing them.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] do you value 'freedom' over safety?!
<|emo_fear|> We used to do a lot of terrible shit in the past that’s not a good argument
<|emo_surprise|> Thats a move i havent seen before
<|emo_sad|> I blinked at the perfect moment and thought no one was going to save that man.
<|emo_anger|> I. AM. AWARE. That doesn't make it cool and good for him to race bait.
<|emo_sad|> I miss you big strong daddy
<|emo_joy|> Oh [NAME] I needed that laugh
<|emo_disgust|> > [NAME]. You disgust me. But seriously when do we get a real show and skip the constant ad teases.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I don't know how [NAME] handled that"
"<|emo_sad|> Me too, I've heard before that I'm too blunt and I feel bad about it at times"
"<|emo_joy|> >cold, dead butt Ah, so it's laughter. Laughter is what kills me. "
"<|emo_joy|> yiss they buffed [NAME], my favorite talent <3"
<|emo_sad|> Sold out. Sorry my dude!
<|emo_sad|> I'm kinda the opposite. I always look dour and sad even when I'm not...
<|emo_surprise|> We might now be almost maybe nearly ready to potentially maybe play finals. I think [NAME] will make the finals this year. They'll be the surprise team.
"<|emo_sad|> Missed Opportunity for a cat burglar joke, still 7/10"
"<|emo_joy|> Let's wait for January patch, and hope that your problems will be resolved soon. I have too much fun in this game right now :) "
<|emo_surprise|> i wonder how people who are in college/undergrad who are in stable relationships do it.
<|emo_joy|> Nice! Boahs for everyone!
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, thanks whoever did the silver❣ put a ray of sunshine into an otherwise cloudy day! "
<|emo_surprise|> Omg where did you get this?
"<|emo_surprise|> I knew nothing about the cult, and it is one of my 2 or 3 favorite Netflix originals. "
<|emo_joy|> Sorry you can’t enjoy things cause other people enjoy them lol. Your loss
<|emo_joy|> good to hear my man!
<|emo_anger|> You crush them up
<|emo_disgust|> A fly is a very tiny thing. But put it in someone’s soup a lot of attention.
<|emo_joy|> As a college student that played football I'm with you lol. My team smashed mcdonalds all the time and it was great
<|emo_surprise|> It’s amazing what they can justify to themselves. I’m not sure if I can believe anything out of her mouth anymore.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow! Never thought of it this way but that's a REALLY good point.
<|emo_joy|> Ok cheers. I’m banned from there
<|emo_disgust|> Disgusting. Need to get the tooth hole fixed😂
<|emo_anger|> Then go fucking cry you weak minded piece of shit.
<|emo_disgust|> Oh there's still bugs? Weird
<|emo_surprise|> I genuinely cannot believe [NAME] didn't get fired years ago. It shocks me more than [NAME].
<|emo_fear|> I think the driver had the heart attack. She did not even give him a wave and a thank you for not smashing her precious child.
<|emo_joy|> Whew. I'm safe then.
<|emo_joy|> Omg [NAME]! One of my favorite bb players
<|emo_sad|> Gatling guns hurt so much it can be like instant death with no way to react
<|emo_fear|> And you truly need to be there and see this wide spread nonchalant attitude to truly understand it how bad and rampant it is.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] GIVES BARRIERS NOT SHIELDS. LUCIO BARRIERS GIVE ULTS. HAMMOND BARRIERS DONT GIVE
"<|emo_sad|> All the things you've been thinking about, fangirls, make me sad."
<|emo_joy|> Ur a silly goose
"<|emo_anger|> No you don't, you love lies and liars. "
<|emo_disgust|> I like how not remove other things for stupid stuff and this doesn’t get removed
<|emo_disgust|> BANG motherfucker!
"<|emo_disgust|> All the smut at Target makes me cringe. That, and the very clearly politically-charged children's books."
<|emo_anger|> This team needs to tighten up in the third. Absolutely brutal.
"<|emo_anger|> I’d lick the juice off Master’s face any day, n-no matter how sour... "
"<|emo_fear|> Which is odd, he was terrible on Sunday"
<|emo_joy|> It’s a party and we’re all invited
<|emo_fear|> It is 100% a scam. They've been copying many [NAME] with the same message.
"<|emo_joy|> Think its time you let your butterfly self out, dear...."
<|emo_disgust|> Did I say he was a scammer? I said he's disgusting and there's nothing endearing about him at all. Not surprised this subreddit is defending him
"<|emo_anger|> Sir the fuck down. This is an intervention, we need to talk."
<|emo_joy|> That's crazy; I went to a super [RELIGION] high school and I think I can remember 2 girls the entire 4 years that became teen moms.
<|emo_anger|> Instagram is the only one to blame for all this evil
<|emo_anger|> Yes. You fucking troll me every time. Fuck you.
<|emo_sad|> The “sad [NAME]” tops it off
<|emo_surprise|> Someone may have mineswept it after we left for all I know...*shudders thinking about it*.
<|emo_fear|> HOW ELSE ARE WE GOING TO AVOID THE NO-DEAL APOCALYPSE!???
"<|emo_fear|> That sounds terrible, man. Have you been to a doctor yet?"
"<|emo_sad|> Also the reason for last year, playing him as a cb was necessary but proven to be a terrible position to be in."
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad you called it because it really is a beautiful and beautifully honest statement.
<|emo_surprise|> Pretty normal! I have a friend who is exactly the same :)
<|emo_surprise|> 👍 excellent! I was wondering if anyone else knew this little known nugget from history.
"<|emo_surprise|> Omg enough of all the damn hashtags, it’s not 2016 anymore"
"<|emo_anger|> No offense, but your parents are assholes."
"<|emo_anger|> What's old is dumb ass ""durr both sides"" arguments that require absolutely zero thought to make."
<|emo_fear|> Yeah until the last one has creepily wed and reproduced.
<|emo_fear|> That is a deadly accident just waiting to happen.
<|emo_anger|> Wow and shes fine to screwed people up ?@ wow are you sure from this story though?! How did people add thos storey up ?!
<|emo_anger|> It kind of blew my mind to see that after reading some of the most generic advices in that post. Who the f* upvote these posts?
<|emo_fear|> This picture really drives home that the CIS can be super terrifying when they want to.
<|emo_surprise|> I don’t think you even know what you are talking about yourself
<|emo_disgust|> When your awkwardness only makes you even hotter.... I am not this kind of girl but look equally as awkward.

<|emo_joy|> Congrats I’m very happy for your happy ending. Wish you guys many many years of happiness together
<|emo_joy|> At least it made for hilarious responses by people being aghast by the price.
<|emo_anger|> im sure it's a real slap in the face
<|emo_anger|> I’m not frustrated... i think I was trying to be nice.. but now I’m confused and awkward. My apologies
<|emo_sad|> I understand why... But it's so sad we have to lie... It breaks my heart...
<|emo_joy|> I'm so glad Mercy's have to actually try now.
<|emo_disgust|> Absolutely terrible. But wholesome aswell.
"<|emo_joy|> Read the poem ""To this Day"". I just read it. I liked it."
"<|emo_anger|> America is not a country, it's a fucking business. if you have zero money, no one cares about you."
<|emo_surprise|> Conservatives now hate dancing... anybody surprised?
<|emo_joy|> I moved to the construction industry because it's less mental stress and I can myself better
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME], don't fucking front the pass if your help defender is [NAME] he will not help you"
"<|emo_disgust|> Weird, just got back from the one on Grand 45 min ago and I got in and out no problem. "
<|emo_disgust|> Real class A asshole there
<|emo_fear|> #OMG TERRIFYING!!!!
<|emo_disgust|> Hilariously wrong and uncontroversial.
<|emo_disgust|> I like to imagine that it's just the same 2 incompetent drivers who live in the area and keep plowing into innocent cars at that one fateful intersection.
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]? I'd be surprised if he plays.
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] voice actor by the end of the game was phenomenal. So much rage and sadness
<|emo_joy|> It's special if you're into it. Some women genuinely enjoy it.
<|emo_surprise|> The monster!
<|emo_disgust|> I was thinking that as well after I posted. Some nasty stuff settles on ceiling tiles.
<|emo_joy|> I enjoy therapy...everyone's different I guess...I don't think there really is any other alternative....sexual abuse need professional help.
"<|emo_sad|> That's unreal. Be homeless, drag a giant bag of leaking cans on board, piss yourself and nobody bats an eye. "
<|emo_anger|> Right? I hear too many horror stories of people ordering online and not getting the copy on the release date. I would be so pissed.
<|emo_joy|> Thousands of people born every single day! But mine? Mine's a god damned miracle!
"<|emo_joy|> Wow....thank you...you just ""woke"" me up :) "
<|emo_anger|> It's pretty obvious why they're filming dipshit
<|emo_joy|> omfg my two favorite shows
"<|emo_sad|> So, the cops raided my favorite massage parlor today."
"<|emo_disgust|> I didn’t think it was possible for one Twitter account to be so obnoxious, but here it is."
"<|emo_joy|> Fuck yeah, I eighteenth this. "
<|emo_fear|> This year would’ve been the year to start it... we’ll likely be losing the heart of our team after this season
<|emo_surprise|> I’m genuinely surprised that [NAME] didn’t believe [NAME] lipstick speech - like that shit genuinely moved me
<|emo_joy|> I'm a Bioware fanboy so obviously biased. I even enjoyed Andromeda. Haha.
<|emo_sad|> Sorry for your loss; this story is heartwarming.
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh that leg. Like, she NEEDS to get that looked at!! ASAP!"
<|emo_sad|> Another senseless tragedy.
<|emo_disgust|> Thank you! I will take that warning under consideration. History is brutal but there's detail and unnecessary detail.
<|emo_surprise|> The white thing high up in the yellow square is my uncle [NAME] glass eye. Wonder how it got there.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, your ex partner sounds exactly like mine."
"<|emo_anger|> What, again? This stupid country!"
"<|emo_fear|> Her expression kills me. *WAKE ME UP, WAKE ME UP INSIDE* "
<|emo_sad|> You can see they actually blocked them since the last message is green. That is so messed up.
<|emo_anger|> THIS BULLSHIT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER. SIGNATURE WIN. [NAME] SMELLS LIKE SHIT AND DOESN'T RECYCLE.
<|emo_anger|> This makes me unfathomably angry.
<|emo_joy|> Done! Good luck!
"<|emo_surprise|> And do they all follow her main account? See, she has fans, they just all happen to be her. Lol"
"<|emo_disgust|> I know the planes are bad, but come on man."
"<|emo_surprise|> I’m surprised nyxl hasn’t done that with their overloaded dps roster, but a possible upcoming import limit might be the issue"
<|emo_anger|> MORE OF THAT PLEASE NORMAN!!!
<|emo_sad|> >[NAME] later admits to his brother he killed me ~~cause he hates bards~~ because he doesn't have the chops to run a robust encounter. FIFY
<|emo_disgust|> This is ugly af sry
"<|emo_joy|> As a person with autism and ADHD, at least I'm alive."
<|emo_sad|> I did this once with a chimichanga. I was 11 and I cried
"<|emo_joy|> Giving gold is like a thank you irl, just go out and start thanking people OP."
<|emo_sad|> That would be really rough. However she is so incompetent I wouldn’t be surprised if she self immolates
"<|emo_anger|> When will this copypasta die, it must be going strong for 10 years"
<|emo_joy|> one of my all time favorite episodes i even love the closing animation of them crossing the bridge out of the
<|emo_joy|> Is...Is this a Hitman themed FE Shitpost?...I dunno whether to be happy or impressed by this.
<|emo_joy|> Enjoy
<|emo_sad|> Yeah it sort of sucks now.
<|emo_joy|> Glad to see Hearts fans giving [NAME] such a warm welcome back..

"<|emo_surprise|> Oh boy, leprosy!"
"<|emo_joy|> As soon as he was about to jump I audibly let out a “dude, just don’t..”"
<|emo_joy|> I think someone else should open a drive through so I can enjoy the flavours without the dishes aha

<|emo_anger|> This is some of the worst passing I've ever seen.
<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting.
<|emo_anger|> if you hate pedos then check out

<|emo_fear|> It’s gonna be a large group interview in a shady office. Ghost em.
<|emo_fear|> People tremble in fear of the name Rupple Poopels 😂
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME] looks too creepy,but it's a very nice drawing."
"<|emo_joy|> I stoped telling story because ''[NAME]""*. Drawing makes me look intensely people to measure their ratio and understand their shapes. That's my new fun"
<|emo_fear|> This is so scary but true
"<|emo_sad|> I love your work, it makes my hair cry"
<|emo_joy|> Agreed. I'm happy he was able to find a resolution of sorts; to effectively overcome the event.
<|emo_anger|> **KICK HIS ASS SEABASS**
<|emo_anger|> Insurance covers stupid.
"<|emo_sad|> More like 11 feet up, but still painful. "
<|emo_joy|> Just smile and wave boys. Smile and wave.
<|emo_disgust|> And there's good reason for that. The SD is absolute shit
<|emo_joy|> Oh well... I'll like both of you.
<|emo_disgust|> I agree. I watched this one because it was literally the first one I found on TV. It was awful.
"<|emo_joy|> Congrats, darling! That is a monumentally meaningful accomplishment. I'm both happy for and proud of you <3"
"<|emo_anger|> My girlfriend barely tolerates me showering in the morning, she'd be furious if I'd let an alarm ring while I'm away. And rightfully so. "

<|emo_sad|> What country? That sounds like a sad septic system. I'm sorry.
<|emo_fear|> That kinda happened to me at a chillibees once. I semi full on panicked. I grew to hate that place. And booths.
"<|emo_fear|> And for those of us older 49ers fans, they used to be division rivals too!"
<|emo_anger|> > and no one but angry community fanboys have pushed back against his statements.
<|emo_sad|> Wanted something more on Imperius Angiris Wrath ulti at lvl 20... :'( Nice buff to Valorus Pursuit though!
<|emo_joy|> Lol nice grammar
<|emo_anger|> There's no better way to make yourself miserable than by comparing yourself to others.
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] shitting the bed like a 4 year old with diarrhea
<|emo_fear|> Katy/cypress area is just as bad if not worse in some areas. Luckily we only saw one driver obviously drunk but there were several wrecks. Be safe everyone
"<|emo_joy|> Despite all the [NAME] hate in/on /Melbourne, here is a beautiful Indian song for you all "
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow! If they were to follow that logic, they would have to ask why on earth we were given doctors! Insanity."
<|emo_anger|> So fucking heart warming. Brother love man it’s wholesome as shit.
<|emo_sad|> sorry. I don't want to put words in your mouth.

<|emo_joy|> Thank you for reminding me about how much I love the JJBA abridged series.

<|emo_anger|> *snerk* People like this kill me. Idiots.
<|emo_anger|> My favorite part of women being in the game is fucking destroying them. Take that femenists

<|emo_anger|> Damn this was deep. Hope the best for you and you could really turn this into a short story or something of the such.
<|emo_sad|> It bothers me that he doesn’t respond to your texts. That’s weird
<|emo_fear|> It is January after all. The yard in my house is looking horrific right now - I haven't been out in 4 months!
<|emo_sad|> I'm crying.
<|emo_anger|> And you know they never grow out of that...I hate people. Myself included.
<|emo_sad|> The mods deleted it I'm sorry
<|emo_surprise|> Oooo too soon man
<|emo_surprise|> A girl known as daddy... well that’s a new twist on an old trick
<|emo_surprise|> Fuck off.
<|emo_anger|> this is so niche but i still felt that shit in my bones
<|emo_surprise|> I remember hearing a story about this type of highway camaraderie once from a trucker who helped a woman escape a man... wonder if it was your mom
<|emo_fear|> I discovered this show on the cnn docuseries about the nineties. What a terrible idea for a show 😂😂
<|emo_joy|> You get a lot more freedom and free time. College is a blast

<|emo_surprise|> I remember hearing a story about this type of highway camaraderie once from a trucker who helped a woman escape a man... wonder if it was your mom
<|emo_anger|> I do remember this and wanted nothing more than to kill that guy
<|emo_joy|> It’s a joke.
<|emo_sad|> It's hard to say. They are an above average team that often looks lifeless and underachieves.
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry for bringing up so many problems without any solutions, and sorry for just being whiny overall. Thanks for the time you've spent talking with me"
"<|emo_joy|> Holy heck I'm so happy for you! That shit is an expense no one needs to worry about, and nor you don't! :D"
<|emo_anger|> No way a tattooed ex-con with a drug/drinking problem might turn abusive!
<|emo_sad|> can I use I can't believe it's not butter because my boyfie doesn't make over 20k :(
"<|emo_joy|> Wrong on so many levels. Just sit back and watch it implode. It will hurt at first, but guarantee, you will have the last laugh. "
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] and the Chicago Wolves (I'm so sorry)
<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Yellow erasure much??? 😡
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow look at this deep pockets eating a lentil a day, I have to slice mine to last me a month!!!"
"<|emo_fear|> oh man clicking 2 buttons before you read an article, the absolute horror"
<|emo_joy|> i am. This means i will move from MTN to VODACOM. and i only roam!! Wow
"<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry, but this has also caught my attention and I kinda want to see this screenplay."
"<|emo_disgust|> Ah it's too complicated, I'll start dating dudes instead."
<|emo_joy|> Just smile and wave boys. Smile and wave.
"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, I don’t get paid 30 million a year to get my a** kicked."
"<|emo_sad|> Just spend the next few months emotionally detatching, it makes the break up less debilitating."
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow dad, you took a baptismal for me"
<|emo_anger|> You can find something sexist or racist or disparaging of some group in just about every movie or tv show.
"<|emo_joy|> I think it's because he was so damn happy for his friend, which again, is sweet as hell."
<|emo_joy|> Ngl the entire first order feels like a joke...
<|emo_sad|> Sadly there's a good chance that you still need a car anyway because that affordable neighborhood will involve a one hour commute.
<|emo_sad|> I'd rather be bitter and angry than miserable.
"<|emo_sad|> Wow that's a burden, I'm sorry."
<|emo_sad|> I feel terrible for their daughter. I wouldnt want to grow up in between the middle of that.
<|emo_joy|> Same - I feel like I stim a lot more - but I'm much more comfortable and less self-conscious about it.
<|emo_anger|> Now we’re wishing death on 15 year old kids? Keep setting the bar lower please
<|emo_anger|> LIIIIIIIIIII🅱IIIIIIIIIIIIT. fat bastard was on sunday that i’m too lazy to crop the photo.
<|emo_joy|> I’m sorry. Happy Birthday! I care ❤️
<|emo_joy|> I’m glad I was able to find a recipe that allowed me to use my Christmas Gift cast iron skillet.
<|emo_joy|> I love [NAME] so much
"<|emo_anger|> That just shows how similar people can be in this kind of situation, demanding, rude, and can sometimes damage stuff without care"
"<|emo_anger|> Lack of content, which led to shipping wars, which destroyed everybody’s minds, which created this."
"<|emo_anger|> Not only do they make me cringe, I become angry because usually or is my nmother and her flying monkey daughter posting them. Just horrible."
"<|emo_fear|> And then you're stuck on that medication for life, sounds like a scary trade-off."
<|emo_fear|> I’m scared.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow.. must have missed this. This is really fucked up if true!
"<|emo_disgust|> The real worst though is when she says, ""I love you more"" 100% seriously."
<|emo_fear|> Going to jump sides 2nd half lol
<|emo_anger|> i wouldn’t want to fight me neither
<|emo_anger|> I'm saying your question is irrelevant to the post's topic. Stop being passive aggressive.
"<|emo_joy|> The no rape was my favorite part, so glad people agree"
<|emo_surprise|> Damn... that’s another thing I didn’t even think about it. Probably the biggest reason why people shouldn’t steal food
<|emo_anger|> is it big market privilege? Cause the braves got fucked for similar crimes.
<|emo_sad|> Sadly I don't think even half the people who watched the game are gonna hear about that.
<|emo_sad|> You look like 1 of those ISIS fighters got shot in the head
"<|emo_disgust|> No, it's a back massage at best. At worst it can give you a stroke and kill you."
<|emo_joy|> A couple of times I thought she was going to start laughing.
<|emo_anger|> Would the OP care to explain what the thought was behind posting this here? A warning for justification for potential upcoming gun-control responses?
"<|emo_surprise|> So what you’re saying is that the frogs used to use the chemicals on us? Oh, how the tables have turned."
"<|emo_surprise|> PHX at home? Should be a cakewalk, right guys?"
<|emo_surprise|> Interesting. I wonder how does this work. Does it do swaps itself? Does it utilize the currency exchange listings? I'll check it out later.
<|emo_sad|> Are you sincerely saying that [NAME] are bad because they were in the minority?
<|emo_fear|> I'm 34 and disappointing my mother is still my greatest fear.
<|emo_anger|> my new clock based face meant to make you contemplate the inevitable passage of time! no ccw movements bitches!
<|emo_fear|> > Crab Rave Ayyy I've never seen this before I kinda wanna go but seems scary.
<|emo_fear|> That sounds awful. Do you like that schedule?
<|emo_sad|> And that's an issue. Councils are *so* unrepresentative it hurts.
<|emo_anger|> You really need to stop hanging out with those people.
<|emo_joy|> Picked up my new glasses. Does anyone else feel nauseous after getting a new prescription
<|emo_anger|> You're going to seriously regret this in a few years.
<|emo_sad|> 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I’m sorry for your misfortune but it’s still funny too.
<|emo_sad|> Me thinks this crosses the line of dignity. Makes me sad. It’s one thing to expose things but another to mock it.
<|emo_anger|> The missing salsa is driving me nuts!
<|emo_joy|> Glad you found it!
<|emo_disgust|> China cheating the rest of the world is horrible for the economy and society.
<|emo_disgust|> So get a job and leave. It's just going to get worse. First the tv then you. Get out while you can
"<|emo_surprise|> I read that as ""tarantula Mounting"" and was pleasantly surprised"
<|emo_anger|> Rest can be so damn broken.
"<|emo_joy|> Loving it too, has made me forget about BO4 & Destiny 2...so addicting! "
<|emo_disgust|> oh thats nasty!
"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME], this really is stunning"
<|emo_disgust|> Weird as I do know I've seen CoC waste/recycling services trucks picking up bins as early as 6:30AM.
<|emo_anger|> Someone with erectile dysfunction already can't (conventionally) orgasm. What the fuck are you talking about?
<|emo_surprise|> Looks like the next level of a horror character
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] hates us man. He’s a stone cold killer.
<|emo_surprise|> I like The Office but this seems a bit weird.
"<|emo_sad|> Tried it. Failed it. Got mental consequences, my memory wont recover after half a year. You will regret it."
<|emo_anger|> We gotta throw the whole world away
"<|emo_surprise|> I still want to know what happened with his ex. One minute they were talking babies and the next, [NAME] was engaged to [NAME]...? "
<|emo_anger|> 9/10 our managers side with us because if they don't we get angry at them. The guestomer will never be coming back but the employee will
"<|emo_joy|> Dam tears in my eyes now, but seriously great job "
<|emo_joy|> wow I think you've really got her now
"<|emo_fear|> Not sure what's cringe about this, even if you disagree with the political message"
<|emo_disgust|> Freedom? Not in New 2013 and it’s gotten a lot worse since
<|emo_sad|> That was so sad. And she kept calling for mommy the whole time. Then they ditched her with grandma.
<|emo_disgust|> Biting the hand that feeds them
<|emo_fear|> Time to cut him off. Or find a way to get him good help. Cause he sounds a little dangerous.
<|emo_disgust|> So it's okay when [NAME] does it. But when I do it. I'm being weird. I see. Got it.
<|emo_sad|> I would suffer a heat stroke or die of diarrhea
<|emo_joy|> Keep gg too bro!
<|emo_disgust|> I really can’t understand why adopting a baby would not be perfect for them. But that might be because I dont have the child-need myself.
"<|emo_joy|> Yeah I was hoping for age 30+ stories, still interesting to hear other people’s experiences though!"
<|emo_surprise|> Im fine with complaining. A little surprised he's complaining without playing or even reading the patch notes since they were released.
<|emo_disgust|> Fuck these calls
"<|emo_sad|> I agreed with your first point and then stated a statistic. My bad, awkward wording on my part.😢"
<|emo_anger|> What. The. Fuck.
<|emo_disgust|> Cool as hell
<|emo_sad|> I actually feel assaulted by this video.
<|emo_fear|> Its almost as if everyone is too afraid to be politically incorrect to admit that height and race are a factor.
<|emo_surprise|> I don't think either of them took that bump outside any worse than the other. That was jarring.
<|emo_joy|> I love foreign money. I enjoy making origami from it.
<|emo_anger|> It is amazing how social media is allowing maniacs to congregate. Social media is very bad for us.
"<|emo_anger|> ""Sign our petition to make Qwandor the dragon a male! There are already enough girl characters. We don't need a third!"""
"<|emo_sad|> Im hoping for a relapse too. I like her better, her hair gets darker, her leather jacket comes out. I miss private practice [NAME]"
<|emo_disgust|> She would be devastated! Whatever you're going through won't last forever... this will pass!! Ask for help - find someone to talk to!
<|emo_anger|> She said that? Wtf?? That's fucked up. I shouldn't be surprised. Hypocrisy is common with this bunch.
<|emo_fear|> These refs are remarkably terrible tonight. So are the sabres but wow some terrible calls.
<|emo_joy|> Happy New year!
<|emo_sad|> This hurts me more than the fan meme.
"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, sounds like I missed a few things, I might need to rewatch the first season!"
"<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry you had a bad experience, that's horrible. But that number saved one of my friends lives. Different for everyone"
"<|emo_anger|> >""Fuck it Im on my way out anyway"" ""Fuck it Im on my way out to Seattle"""
<|emo_joy|> We were playing bots for 30 mins... Not fun but i am happy i finally did it
<|emo_surprise|> Wow! Prayers for everyone there.
<|emo_joy|> Thank fuck. So if you play exclusively through Steam is any action needed?
"<|emo_anger|> Yes, exactly. Fix a date and if he still procrastinates ditch him. Or remain his penpal for the rest of your life."
"<|emo_fear|> In that case, I’m appalled. "
<|emo_surprise|> Omg the hockey god’s actually helped us !?
<|emo_anger|> Crap. I need more Excedrin. STAT.
"<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe people are saying [NAME] should have been saved, she knew like 10% of the words"
"<|emo_sad|> It saddens me that [NAME] legacy has become ""Posterboy for edgy manchilds"""
<|emo_surprise|> Let's say he quits or is fired (we already know neither will happen). Who the [NAME] would we pick to replace him?
"<|emo_fear|> There were those god awful GoPro shots in the fight scenes where they had a shaky camera fixed to the actors facing directly at their face, though. "
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry, I was misinformed. My apologies, brother in [NAME]."
<|emo_surprise|> Omg ur like soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo quirky!
<|emo_anger|> BUT WHY IS THE FELLOW HUMAN SHOUTING?
<|emo_joy|> Happy Together. It feels so natural.
"<|emo_surprise|> 730,000 readers and only 6 posts in a week? Wow..."
<|emo_fear|> I would stay away from [NAME]. Apparently his injury got infected and will require more surgery/surgeries
"<|emo_anger|> Dont want to come over as a sadist, but the story makes all those scene 100x better."
<|emo_joy|> I love this drink.GIF
<|emo_disgust|> Sounds like a great idea that your nephew is moving away from her. She’d be an absolutely toxic mother.
<|emo_sad|> At least your stepdad didn't just take the pillow look at you and leave...
<|emo_fear|> It's practically non existent. Im mostly afraid to initiate a hug because I'm afraid I don't know/forgot how to hug.
<|emo_fear|> This is terrifying. Good luck to you and your family. Hopefully they figure out who the creepers are very soon.
"<|emo_disgust|> Oh btw this was me yesterday, commenting on that ""ugly"" ban! "
<|emo_surprise|> Ah ha!
"<|emo_surprise|> And it should be drenched in blood. It’s supposed to be scary, that’s how you know [NAME] loves you!"
"<|emo_sad|> Something something ""low information voters"" or whatever other euphemisms the bro-iest bros use for anyone not like them."
<|emo_anger|> That damn FDR who America loved so much they had to write an amendment to the Constitution to keep anyone else from being elected that many times
<|emo_joy|> Glad I could help!
"<|emo_joy|> :-) Lunch with the wife on a weekday is such a special treat, even when one is under the weather."
<|emo_sad|> Your life must be miserable. That's sad somehow
"<|emo_fear|> I'd be worried about the tone, not the content."
"<|emo_anger|> Not to assume things here but why would you gas yourself over [NAME], kid is a fucking monster"
"<|emo_fear|> Spoiler alert, it's terrifying and depressiong"
<|emo_joy|> He can do a balloon party with his brony friends
<|emo_disgust|> Don't be a [NAME] and misuse this term. We've reserved it for a movement of women who are done with sexual harassment.
<|emo_surprise|> I felt my heart drop. [NAME].
<|emo_anger|> I don't care about him at all. 😤😤😤
<|emo_sad|> This is so sweet and it makes me so happy. But also so sad because I hate seeing families torn apart.
<|emo_disgust|> Well that’s dumb. The question is about this sub.
<|emo_anger|> You want forgiveness? Stop spamming.
<|emo_joy|> Hi [NAME] nice to see you
"<|emo_sad|> Measuring my life in semesters filled with classes that are entirely worthless but I need a $60,000 piece of paper to get a job "
<|emo_anger|> Stop it. You're giving me that warm fuzzies now.
<|emo_joy|> I can't not pick Savor the Flavor when playing Stitches though. It's just too damn fun.
<|emo_anger|> BUT IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN THEM LIKE TWO SECONDS TO HELP HIM GET OUT REALLY!!! This show makes me angry sometimes.
<|emo_joy|> That’s crazy! I’ve watched every season 6 times now and I’m just realizing that they are in an office!
"<|emo_sad|> You must be heartbroken, I’m so sorry. Can you start seeing a therapist?"
<|emo_disgust|> Everyone knows a Sith would be called [NAME]. What a terrible fan of the franchise that poser is.
<|emo_sad|> I've gotten injured before in RTTS from being hit (Bruised hand). 3 day DL.
<|emo_fear|> I realize. I was too hasty in my conclusions.
"<|emo_fear|> Horrible day for the show. Everyone is dying, someone put [NAME] in a bubble!"
<|emo_joy|> So happy for you two !! ❤️
<|emo_disgust|> Really weird how such a young child could come up with that.
<|emo_sad|> This is exactly what it's been like. I feel personally victimised by it all
<|emo_anger|> Yes. I hate everything that has to do with my depression.
<|emo_anger|> This makes me unfathomably angry.
<|emo_disgust|> FYI: Time in Europe works the same as in the State. We do not have 'weird time'
<|emo_sad|> Don't forget about the flooding in Houston. :/
"<|emo_surprise|> Like it was over wayyyyy too fast for a real one. Shit, the Taliban lasted for years, and ISIS is still a huge problem."
<|emo_anger|> I sure hope so! Smug bastards!
<|emo_surprise|> The comment came up as a text notification and old people are always convinced hackers are getting into their phones.
"<|emo_anger|> Yeah suck it, California"
<|emo_disgust|> Three. Three layers of bad.
<|emo_fear|> Oh my god Del Monico. Horrific. Even the ambient smell in the hallways makes me gag.
<|emo_fear|> Champaign’s a weird town in that aspect..
<|emo_sad|> Heart of darkness
"<|emo_joy|> Reminds me of that chick and the lizard, [NAME], and 7-11 tried to get the store number lol"
<|emo_surprise|> oh my [NAME]
"<|emo_anger|> I know you're annoyed, but can this sub not be a place to post screenshots of poor opinions from the other sub? It's getting overwhelming."
<|emo_disgust|> I hope The pelicans trade him and [NAME] if they trade [NAME]. Hate to see them waste away in NO
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh sorry. To clarify, I was wondering if I should mention that I am more than willing to help her if need be."
"<|emo_anger|> Worse, he murdered King [NAME] in the most cowardly way possible. Both in the books and the show. "
"<|emo_joy|> I like Sao very much, bit not because of the game setting, for other reasons. The game itself sucks, tbh."
<|emo_sad|> I am sorry human being :(
<|emo_sad|> One of my favorite films. I got to see a screening with a live soundtrack conducted by [NAME]. There were tears in my eyes!
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, the menacing head shake...(shivers) "
<|emo_joy|> And it was out of their control as well for both. That's funny
<|emo_sad|> I think I’m about to die from cringe overdose
"<|emo_surprise|> I'm so stupid, I can do this. On accident. so not very well."
<|emo_joy|> here's a nice little introduction video for
<|emo_sad|> What a poor woman who only wanted to tell someone what to do.
<|emo_joy|> No need for pity! It was a happy moment. Tears of joy not sadness
<|emo_surprise|> With the way [NAME] carried himself in Hard Knocks I wouldn’t be surprised if he flew off the handle during his firing.
"<|emo_joy|> I really hope you won't have the chance to enjoy them because man, I didn't like them anything :)"
<|emo_joy|> What a turnaround.
<|emo_anger|> Those women are the worst.
<|emo_joy|> ooh a piece of candy
"<|emo_sad|> I'm a firm climate change believer but jeez that was painful to read. Sorry, this is far from bestof"
<|emo_fear|> Yow thats gnarly.
<|emo_joy|> I love the burn
<|emo_disgust|> Ugh. Gross
<|emo_anger|> And get off the phone! Why are you browsing Reddit on a date!?!?!
"<|emo_fear|> [NAME]. Yeah, right. Lol"
<|emo_surprise|> Huh. So it really comes down to looking at her senate career vs her AG career.
"<|emo_disgust|> Honestly, I bet they would argue that the food was out of the car, so you’re not covered. "
<|emo_surprise|> oh is that it
"<|emo_joy|> hey, that's me. Glad i'm done with the class, so much work"
<|emo_anger|> 5 days?!? But I'm mad now!
<|emo_joy|> I lived across the street from it as a child. Used to swim in it as a kid...Ignorance is bliss.
<|emo_disgust|> Are you really that brain dead.....idiot!!!
<|emo_anger|> He said i am being rude to her
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how many didn't get the joke
<|emo_joy|> Love both flags man! I was on my college campus today in my old Thrashers hat while wearing my Jets sweatshirt. Go Jets! Have fun!
<|emo_fear|> Truth Yeah keep living in your reality lol Delusional idiot
<|emo_sad|> it sounds like a huge pain in the ass to use compared to current systems in place though.
<|emo_surprise|> *Hey just noticed..* it's your **6th Cakeday** [NAME]! ^(hug)
<|emo_joy|> The World Between Worlds veered worryingly close to this territory. Luckily it was handled well.
<|emo_fear|> Don't worry about stupid people and you do whatever you want. Screw them kind of people.
"<|emo_sad|> I stated previously, the one knock on [NAME] is his lack of counters. That’s what separates him and [NAME]."
<|emo_anger|> John Oliver is a fucking liberal pig.
"<|emo_anger|> Vanity is a sin, [NAME] wants us to hate our bodies"
"<|emo_disgust|> Behavior I'd consider deeply immoral without showing true remorse (I'm talking rape, torture of animals, that sort of thing)."
<|emo_joy|> So happy the new rules weren't in place back then. All those hard hits on [NAME] would have made the refs flag-happy
"<|emo_joy|> i enjoyed this a lot. i especially enjoyed ""Everybody bleeds a little when they brush their teeth """
<|emo_sad|> I want to make friends too :( but I feel like I have nothing good to offer
<|emo_surprise|> Wow [NAME] has a lot more insecurities than I thought
<|emo_anger|> Fuck these calls
<|emo_disgust|> The double standard. Taking pictures of women without their permission is taboo and creepy.
<|emo_joy|> Good job shining up your spine and telling him it's over! Your life is going to get so much better with him not dragging you down.
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah he's a cunt but that doesn't mean he should be prosecuted for a joke. No matter how bad taste it was.
"<|emo_anger|> You'd think, but people are given a lot of leeway. Hell, in the South, public schools are allowed to spank children."
<|emo_anger|> I feel your pain 😪 i got scammed $1400 in November. I felt like a dumbass for falling for it too.
<|emo_joy|> I know a couple of people who are. It's amazing to watch.
"<|emo_surprise|> “Oh hey, I think a second ago [NAME] just put a move on [NAME]! Oh boy I wonder how that was.”"
"<|emo_disgust|> It may have been funny in 2010, but now it's completely unorginal and boring. "
<|emo_anger|> Id buy those shoes and walk in the dirtiest places just to piss [NAME] off.
<|emo_sad|> Ashamed of being British
<|emo_anger|> Damn how do you post something directly to the front page?
<|emo_joy|> Oh the joys of Marine Corps boot camp!!
"<|emo_surprise|> On a related note, why does it shatter? I expected it to break into a few large pieces, rather than completely fall apart."
<|emo_anger|> Somebody's obnoxious.
"<|emo_joy|> Love it! It’s somewhat realistic. Maybe not that THAT degree, but I enjoyed it."
"<|emo_joy|> I don't know you, but I am so proud of you. Hugs."
"<|emo_joy|> Happy birthday, [NAME]! Hope you have a wonderful day!"
<|emo_anger|> The power dynamics argument is one of the most ridiculous arguments ever - unless it’s someone who has a *direct* influence on your life or outcomes.
<|emo_sad|> you're [NAME]
"<|emo_fear|> [NAME], that is so horrible. I’m so sorry for you and OP."
<|emo_joy|> Ignorance is bliss
<|emo_surprise|> this is a thing? oh no
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, didn't expect this thread to get philosophical."
<|emo_anger|> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) you know you are. I bet its its awful being totally destroyed and embarrassed on the internet hahaha ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
<|emo_fear|> Why do all the animals look terrifying oh god oh fuck
<|emo_anger|> What a terrible list
<|emo_anger|> Cognitive dissonance. I don't support diagnosis via internet but she needs medical help NOT a medical license.
"<|emo_anger|> Fuck people that don't like pbr, only cheap bear I'll drink next to natty boh"
<|emo_joy|> YUP. I’ve been healthier since the new year FINALLY smh
<|emo_fear|> or a horrible night of 15/4/4
"<|emo_sad|> Turns out, that daddys little girl is a thot, who also takes drugs. No wonder she fled her country."
"<|emo_joy|> Yeah, when I saw she was in LA, I really hope that. Oh please, be true."
<|emo_joy|> They still make VCRs? This makes me happy and I’m not quite sure why.
"<|emo_disgust|> Newsflash: Ugly people cheat, too. Cheaters cheat. Cheating is a behavior, not a look. "
<|emo_sad|> How can you look at that. it hurts.
<|emo_joy|> Wow! That's awesome! Congratulations! Its wonderful to have hope of being off medications one day.
"<|emo_fear|> That is so creepy and scary. Imagine if he really was a Dr, and the only one available in your hmo."
<|emo_anger|> Gotta offload this crap somehow.
"<|emo_disgust|> The last thing I want on my team are former Eagles players. Fuck that team, the organization, and the shitty fanbase "
"<|emo_anger|> The last book feels like a dream. It's ridiculously bad, imo "
<|emo_disgust|> Well I mean this game is so stupid in a lot of ways tbh
<|emo_sad|> i gasped. This sucks. He was very very sick and I hope he's at peace.
<|emo_surprise|> Omg this. The amount of time I've spent educating men about things they literally could have Googled🙄
"<|emo_anger|> Fucking monophanie looking ass floating with the dead, nice."
<|emo_anger|> As high as ~72% in black families. Truly heartbreaking what the expansion of the welfare state has done to the black family.
<|emo_fear|> I watched a really bad horror movie she starred in but I think it predated VPR.
"<|emo_joy|> Ah yes. Recursion. The backbone of Marxist theory. Glad you brought it up, chap"
<|emo_surprise|> Surprising you choose to believe things that aren’t true 🤔
<|emo_sad|> Sorry you’re not allowed to be a Vikings fan anymore then
<|emo_surprise|> He was dead through the whole movie. Oh wait
<|emo_anger|> Nooooooooo I was a student staff member at the WCC and this makes me so sad and angryyyyy
<|emo_anger|> You are oddly defensive about a random chef. Did you come to /r/wewantplates just to insult people and build up this chef? [NAME]
<|emo_joy|> I love how happy the dog looks in this pic. 😊
"<|emo_surprise|> For real. After I saw that, I just stopped reading. My eyes spun right out of my head. "
<|emo_surprise|> I thought that was a dude the whole time
<|emo_sad|> You can remove them without killing or etc etc. Just stop reproduction
<|emo_disgust|> This looks unnaturally fake
"<|emo_sad|> Spoiler alert, it's terrifying and depressiong"
<|emo_surprise|> I’m surprised alcohol isn’t entirely sold by the state like it is in many states in the East.
<|emo_sad|> The bitch doesnt need drag race (bc shes amazing) but im still sad.
<|emo_fear|> That is utterly horrifying. I'm so sorry that your kindergarten teacher was such a heartless old bat.
<|emo_surprise|> I wondered where the quote about “supporting your azz” and was very pleased to finally find the train wreck that said it.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow grats man. Hopefully I can use this inspiration for myself tomorrow. If there was something new you learned in this experience would share it?
<|emo_anger|> This is hilarious. Great work🤣
<|emo_anger|> Except [NAME] is worse
"<|emo_joy|> I was actually looking in to this game, glad they did this now so I can avoid it, yeesh"
<|emo_disgust|> Same. Body hair (on my own body..I don't care what anybody else does with THEIR body hair) grosses me the fuck out.
<|emo_sad|> That would expand his torso and ribs which probably hurts
<|emo_joy|> Ok. This is freaking awesome! Good job.
"<|emo_sad|> I feel bad for her, talk to her :("
"<|emo_surprise|> Surprise, [RELIGION] article says [RELIGION] is wrong. Also, we don't worship the same [NAME]. They added [NAME], who is not [NAME]."
<|emo_disgust|> Weird crowd.
<|emo_sad|> Sorry buddy I think that one is permanently dead. :(
"<|emo_sad|> Oh, I'm dying to know if you noticed any reaction from him!"
<|emo_anger|> I’d be damned if she isn’t the one cleaning up that mess
<|emo_joy|> Ignorance is bliss
"<|emo_joy|> It’s all good man, I missed [NAME] too. I REALLY hope we get another dream sequence with him in EP4. "
"<|emo_disgust|> Does he have to be so anal about his rep? At least he's (in)famous. *Awesome job, OP!*"
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] looks so fed up with this game. He's going to scream at the whole team after the game.
<|emo_surprise|> I had a feeling...crazy what that guy can do to his body.
<|emo_sad|> that was so sad :(
<|emo_sad|> You sound quite childish and unable to engage with any information that doesn’t conform to your narrative. Sad.
<|emo_anger|> Fuck reddit.
<|emo_sad|> This hurts me.
<|emo_joy|> Oh wow I love this!
<|emo_disgust|> Or we could just get menus with pictures of food like every other rational establishment. It's so bizarre
<|emo_anger|> Just stop.
<|emo_joy|> That can be a perfect gift for a [NAME]. Amazing work !!
<|emo_fear|> Nice width but every day is trap day from now until the show.
"<|emo_joy|> But both lost, whereas moderate Sinema won. Its important because without Arizona there is no real path to Senate majority in 2020."
"<|emo_joy|> This is what makes this sub so valuable, crazy and fun."
<|emo_joy|> Of course. I'm glad you were able to revisit in a healthy manner.
<|emo_anger|> Can you even hide the racism anymore or are we throwing all dog whistles in the trash?
<|emo_disgust|> Weird way to type YYYY-MM-DD
<|emo_surprise|> How DARE you!
<|emo_joy|> Spent time with them. Argue with them. Laugh with them. Cry with them. We all get lonely when we are old.
"<|emo_anger|> Hey! Go fuck yourself, you capitalist apologist bootlicking piece of shit"
"<|emo_joy|> One of my best friends got caught up in Primerica, it was both sad and hilarious "
<|emo_fear|> What changed for [NAME]? Last season he had a spurt of being meta and dominant and [NAME] was a bit of a terror
"<|emo_fear|> errrrrrrrrr that's pointless, and your Doctor I'm afraid is pointless as well."
<|emo_joy|> I’m so glad someone linked it. You’re doing the important work. 🤣
<|emo_sad|> Sad if step kids are nice children I am sorry they are in this dynamic
"<|emo_disgust|> Maybe Shadow Creek Ranch, but I heard it's next to a dump and smells bad."
<|emo_anger|> Understood - PM was all gears and no downtime. Last thing I would want is another bloody job like that. Cheers
"<|emo_surprise|> >If you can’t recognize bad acting like [NAME] emotional scenes, Oh please. Why are you even on this sub? Lol"
<|emo_disgust|> He likes an old song and is young DISGUSTING
"<|emo_anger|> By ranting aimlessly on the internet about it, obviously ;)"
<|emo_surprise|> Oh! Im also Chinese (Singaporean) and due to the laws here my boyfriend and i are looking to go elsewhere...
"<|emo_sad|> Unhappy, I am."
<|emo_surprise|> What a cringeworthy load of kak this is. Wow I have no words.
<|emo_sad|> Stop with this revisionist history we literally just let him go because HE SUCKED
<|emo_joy|> Getting some sick high school nostalgia from this shot. Thanks for that man!
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow okay, where can I get a wind proof lining beaning or scarf? And do I have to cover my eyes or anything?"
<|emo_surprise|> Whew. I thought no one else would recognize Mac Tonight.
<|emo_sad|> I focus on the pain
<|emo_anger|> So now disabled people don’t have rights . You get worse .
<|emo_surprise|> It surprises me that he's a mod some days...
<|emo_sad|> I miss being little 😭😭😭
<|emo_fear|> im shaking and crying right now this is so powerful
"<|emo_sad|> I wouldn't even call this a CB, she wasn't offered anything and turned it down. Still sad, though. "
<|emo_anger|> No one gives a fuck about your internet points guy
<|emo_joy|> beautiful story arc. glad you decided to end it in my semi hometown of excelsior - really neat lil town.
"<|emo_disgust|> I make it a point to toss it real loud in the QMOS bin so they see where the shit goes, [NAME]."
"<|emo_joy|> As a vegan, I can't tell you how happy I am to find any restaurant with vegan options! That man should be showering you with gratitude."
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] expunged my paraphernalia without consent and I called the **LAW TIGERS** to sue him for damages.
"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME], that was 2013? Time flies"
<|emo_anger|> It's hard to respect them as an organization when we hear shit like this. They will struggle as a franchise to win another WS anytime soon.
"<|emo_fear|> Im always worrying about the same thing, thats why Im always posting and within hours freaking out and deleting my posts "
<|emo_joy|> I guess I am totally alone but I am really enjoying the audiobook and haven’t had a single complaint. I’m half way through now
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh my goodness it's like a happy little cloud! What breed is it? Either way, omg enjoy petting that super soft puppy coat for me! "
"<|emo_joy|> I played for a decade+ on release, I'd be happy to help you or anyone else!"
<|emo_fear|> I'm always paranoid of people following me when I am driving home. I would have pooed my pants yikes.
<|emo_anger|> Why do you think many feminists are angry?

"<|emo_surprise|> You mean Ichigo/Nero/Black Ranger/I'm a Frog. Did not know that [NAME] voiced [NAME], but it does exsplain why he sounded so familiar."
"<|emo_anger|> No it’s not, I can give you multiple examples of cops getting physically assaulted and not even using their guns. Stop lying."
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my god.... They used [NAME] voice!
<|emo_sad|> This is disturbing.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] BREAK THE GAME. WHY HAVE YOU GIVEN ALL THE KILLERS A FUCKTON OF THEM. ITS SO DAMN STUPID.
"<|emo_anger|> They'll investigate themselves and nothing will happen. Detroit police bully everyone. An they wonder why no one likes them, Respects them, Or why people run from them. "
<|emo_disgust|> Take the child from them! Wtf? Theyre so dumb. You always secure the kids seat!

"<|emo_fear|> Yes, I've had this fear. It's even worse when you *don't* say goodbye and then it's the last time you see them."

<|emo_fear|> No if we tell and kick and scream and have a tantrum that always works.
<|emo_fear|> Damn. It's hard to comprehend how massive the USA really is.
<|emo_fear|> Yikes. This kind of freaks me out.

"<|emo_joy|> Haha, glad someone was able to point you in the right direction then "

<|emo_fear|> That's the perfect intro for a panic ult.
"<|emo_surprise|> Just ""asking for a friend""...huh? 😂"
<|emo_sad|> Kid looks like he's about to cry
<|emo_surprise|> is this real life [NAME] (netflix)?
"<|emo_joy|> Old school runescape, make an Ironman. It changes the game and makes everything so much more meaningful and fun :) hardcore if you enjoy stress"
"<|emo_disgust|> in many cases both. but this has nothing to do with Japan. You can't stay on topic, can you?"
<|emo_joy|> Love this!!!
<|emo_fear|> I honestly predict a riot on the scale of the 2011 ones if we undergo a no-deal brexit - possibly even worse. It's terrifying.
"<|emo_joy|> My nmom always says ""Well, you learned from it!"""
"<|emo_surprise|> 19??? Yikes slow down, enjoy yourselves and figure yourselves out. Not an age to make big decisions like that, I say at 24..."
"<|emo_disgust|> Honestly just tired of this shit, people who'd rather see us tank than push for playoffs. Literally want us to be the fucking Suns."
<|emo_joy|> Glad to see [NAME] back
<|emo_fear|> I'm so afraid to weigh myself. I'm gonna have to do it soon though 😭
<|emo_anger|> Hate those ~~things~~ Tweets.
"<|emo_fear|> Deathly afraid, the undersides of boats too. I can't look if I see them in a picture or movie"
<|emo_anger|> That sounds frustrating!
"<|emo_sad|> I put ""haha"" after everything I say because I'm insecure "
"<|emo_anger|> No, I generally feel like slugging them in the head repeatedly with an iron bar. Spitting is just petty. *Let your hatred flow!*"
<|emo_joy|> I have and i’ve also shot some ak’s they’re not too bad but i still prefer handguns despite the kick.
<|emo_joy|> Glad to hear it. Love Rapid City.
"<|emo_sad|> Goodness, If you carry on saying mean things like that you might just hurt my feeling."
<|emo_anger|> But they didn't because it's fake.
"<|emo_joy|> That's why I think we should clean house. No more leftists, no more whining."
"<|emo_disgust|> Waiting for it to get better as it’s been getting progressively, exponentially worse for 7+ yrs now"
<|emo_disgust|> Maybe we knew someone was going to sigh and this was all in the works. Just a thought idk. FUCK
<|emo_anger|> This sub needs a damn support group for people that were personally victimized by [NAME]
<|emo_anger|> Players like this makes me rage quit tbh.
"<|emo_surprise|> Really? I live down the street from there, thanks!!!"
<|emo_joy|> I take everyone that visits me over to Lands End .. I'm a huge fan of the hike from there back to Sea Cliff!
<|emo_surprise|> You guys will be shocked to know it is another cut of the Ga Spa vid.
<|emo_disgust|> The worst case of cultural appropriation is him mimicking human language and thoughts when he is clearly some kind of barely sentient pond scum.
"<|emo_sad|> Dentist did this to me I hate it. I knew i should have waited until ""it wad worse"" but i didn't. I regret it "
<|emo_surprise|> I can't imagine buds being very hard to find in Hawaii
<|emo_disgust|> if they’re available for questioning then you’re a shitty kidnapper. -3/5 stars
<|emo_fear|> Oof that’s terrible
"<|emo_disgust|> Ya know, I hate lying but I guess I'd make an exception for this. "
<|emo_anger|> >marry up tho Except it's more cruel for men now. The men who the said women are seeing are most certainly homeless/broke chads.
<|emo_surprise|> I genuinely cannot believe [NAME] didn't get fired years ago. It shocks me more than [NAME].
<|emo_anger|> So long as it's for the worse I'm all for the wait!
<|emo_disgust|> Sitting down and wiping is disgusting. Especislly when using a public toilet. Fucking savages up in this thread.
<|emo_anger|> Damn it.
<|emo_sad|> Sadly my boyfriend's family is the direct opposite but we'll still make it work :3
<|emo_anger|> that' be dope! Like a bunch of arrows following him like Red Death had bats
"<|emo_surprise|> Really takes ya by surprise anyway though, huh?"
"<|emo_fear|> It's a Falling In Reverse song, which makes it even more terrifying"
<|emo_anger|> *snerk* People like this kill me. Idiots.
<|emo_disgust|> Because it's so ridiculously stupid people just can't help themselves.
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] I want to get that ~~monkey~~blackhawk off our back so bad.
<|emo_anger|> Wtf. And then we wonder why people think DnD players are a bunch of fucking creeps. Sucks that you had to bear witness to such sadness.
<|emo_sad|> The deer had been hit by a car and it was only fitting not to let the skin go to waste
<|emo_surprise|> and they are indeed made of gold. this seems like reasonable jewelry prices. or at least not out of left field for designer pieces.
<|emo_anger|> I still think he should have been the first goalie in the 2014 World Cup. But alas that injury ruined everything.
<|emo_fear|> That’s horrible. What country? If you don’t mind. My [NAME] was abused by her heavily religious (Pentecostal) father.
<|emo_sad|> Way too tired for work today so taking the day off. Feels pretty great!
<|emo_joy|> Some people enjoy their music and their fans for the sake of others opinions.
<|emo_disgust|> It's such a shame that the game forces you to use the q-tip and prevents you from equipping any other weapon.
"<|emo_fear|> An ex-friend of mine proclaimed than anyone who speaks of being raped is a horrible, unethical human being."
"<|emo_surprise|> Well, 1/2 has been done already!"
<|emo_disgust|> Shameless plug for /r/Harris2020
<|emo_surprise|> Is that [NAME]?
<|emo_joy|> Saw thundamentals live. happy that this song got in top 30
<|emo_surprise|> omg pizza time with junko time
<|emo_disgust|> Damn we needed that layup
<|emo_anger|> Lol kill me now
"<|emo_disgust|> Man, [NAME] is a weirdo."
<|emo_disgust|> Such a nasty woman
<|emo_sad|> Sorry I dropped mine can I have another?
<|emo_anger|> Remember when the media ignored all of the horrible things [NAME] did? Including what he did to Syria?
<|emo_joy|> I’m glad
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh man, I saw a White Forest Cake the other day and DEAR LORD I almost drooled."
<|emo_sad|> I’ve been kicked in the leg my foots been stamped on. I can’t imagine the pain of this
<|emo_anger|> This is one of the dumbest things I’ve read on reddit this year.
<|emo_disgust|> Upon reading I find this to be fake news and I'm disgusted to learn she writes for the age
<|emo_disgust|> This shit got me rolling LMFAO
<|emo_disgust|> That’s terrible; I would be devastated. You had to get out of there though. I’m thinking of you.
<|emo_sad|> It’s been over 20 years since I rode the 15. I’m still traumatized.
<|emo_joy|> Would of been slightly awkward for someone to walk into my building haha
<|emo_joy|> Pity because I enjoyed Max Normal.
"<|emo_sad|> I am sorry that you are experiencing such deep suffering and such pain. You matter in this world, and we would all be diminished without you."
<|emo_joy|> My partner and I have 17 years between us! Best and healthiest relationship I have been in :)
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] steals the game! (and the puck for bouncing off of Detroit players)
"<|emo_surprise|> I sould have assissted in the stabbing, even ceasar would have been surprised by the amount of stab wounds on that little shit"
<|emo_sad|> Same. And then cried a little.
"<|emo_anger|> In reality the kid said: “fuck off noob, Genji grandmaster main here boiii”"
<|emo_surprise|> What? This isn't boys' night. I don't see [NAME] anywhere.
<|emo_sad|> Sadly I see it being a call to party like there is no tomorrow for the vast majority.
"<|emo_anger|> Yeah like ""oh yeah? No shit?"""
"<|emo_fear|> Honestly, that would be my nightmare, I’d rather keep [NAME] another season and draft a new QB in 2020 instead "
<|emo_joy|> Glad she was a good sport about it.
<|emo_anger|> And it’s not like he was a bad coach. We’ve been spoiled from all our great seasons.
<|emo_anger|> FUCKING DIN!!!
"<|emo_fear|> Not sure about OP, but caffeine tends to make many people more anxious (especially those with a co-morbid anxiety disorder(s))."
"<|emo_anger|> i mean i hate these takes that because we turned the ball over 26 times, the rotations werent a problem. They clearly were"
<|emo_joy|> Really funny how our FO liked the 2 of the worst qbs. [NAME] and [NAME] That’s why I’m skeptical about our FO now
<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] if I was 9 and my parents did that I would cringe real hard
<|emo_joy|> That fellow sure is one hell of a sweet talker!
"<|emo_fear|> I've been trying to as well, but the game is so scary :/"
<|emo_joy|> > How TF did you get to FETISH that quickly? Welcome to the internet. Enjoy your stay.
<|emo_joy|> Nope.cool !🅱️RO
<|emo_disgust|> What a garbage post
<|emo_sad|> Exactly! The mob mentality of these people is sad! Let's bring some love and peace into the world!
<|emo_anger|> I hate it too. But I will....
<|emo_sad|> I really don't think healthy people with no other emotional issues regret having their kids.
"<|emo_sad|> All those empty seats smh. Imagine paying $300+ just to see the Rangers get slaughtered at home. And yet, I still want more goals haha."
<|emo_sad|> I'm so sorry you were bullied in a place you should have felt safe.
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, I definitely got muted, too."
<|emo_surprise|> Crazy how [NAME] being a POS had been factual since the 90s but he’s only now feeling the consequences of his actions
<|emo_anger|> What a fucking cunt
"<|emo_joy|> Wow! Thanks! We’re working on it! Glad you liked it (this is [NAME], the [NAME] one)... appreciate your support!"
"<|emo_fear|> Her upper lip always looks terrible - such an easy fix, can’t believe she is so vain and never bothers to wax "
<|emo_joy|> I was just busting chops. Glad to hear your health is better. I think you've inspired a post on r/intj my friend. Stay tuned.
"<|emo_disgust|> I find porn disgusting and boring, could this be a sign I'm asexual?"
"<|emo_anger|> So just for the record, I’m with you on the football end: Love the Broncs, hate the Pats. 🏈"
<|emo_anger|> Unemployment was also significantly higher at the end of Old Labours tenure than at the beginning. Yet nobody remembers that.
<|emo_sad|> You’re letting psychopathic people ruin your ability to take a joke. That is a mark of a weak man.
"<|emo_anger|> Hate that scene? Believe it or not, jail. "
"<|emo_disgust|> I immediately love your owner. Those guests sucked, but seriously your owner is awesome."
"<|emo_sad|> > When did I ever mention native genocide? How do you think the land was ""stolen""? The residents were killed."
<|emo_joy|> Ooh! I quite like the swimming pool of makeup as well.
<|emo_surprise|> I hieaa i just trip out how your lds and not know or here. Nevermo here a d hears when i was a kid
"<|emo_sad|> I don't live there anymore, but I grew up in the midwest, and the ""ope"" triggered me a little bit"
<|emo_sad|> I feel his pain. Bad dxm trips are the most terrifying thing in the moment but they're way more forgiving than bad psych trips
"<|emo_sad|> I agree. His parents were very supportive then. When they did a cast change, they decided to make his parents jerks! "
"<|emo_disgust|> As bad as this sub was in the 1st quarter, our announcers were just as awful."
"<|emo_fear|> Good for you! I wish I had run for my life at 18, but brainwashing is real"
"<|emo_disgust|> IMO, cheaters are only sorry they got caught, not because they betrayed their spouses and had an affair. "
<|emo_sad|> It's sad that nearly everything seems ok as long as [NAME] told you to do it.
<|emo_sad|> How about breaking into tears whenever one of your friends tells you they trust you because you never understood what trust meant
<|emo_sad|> he stopped talking to me 🤷🏼‍♀️
<|emo_surprise|> No jerk behavior from kitten but watching people interact with that machine was mildly fascinating.
<|emo_surprise|> My god i thought he just hit his shins really hard on the pole but than realised what his shoulders did...
<|emo_anger|> Please stop talking [NAME].
<|emo_anger|> Da Colts!!! Go frank go!!!
"<|emo_sad|> Wow, what a violent cunt."
"<|emo_sad|> Dude, the elderly are some that are the most at risk of dying from the flu."
<|emo_disgust|> cause he likes to eat garbage.
<|emo_joy|> So cool! Me and my sissy got the same but on our arms! On twitter!
<|emo_anger|> If push comes to shove the easy alternative is you show up for work and take up space but don't actually perform your job.
"<|emo_fear|> Also, [NAME] growl/yelling/screaming at [NAME] in the sumo suit on beach day. "
<|emo_joy|> I didn't read the entire article. That's great. Thanks for letting me know. Peace and happy 2019
<|emo_surprise|> Omg! An attentive parent actually teaching their children to safely handle guns! The horror!
<|emo_disgust|> You are so ugly even tears wont show up near you
<|emo_sad|> Sad truth is you cant run away from who you are no matter how hard you try :(
<|emo_joy|> Glad you found it!
<|emo_fear|> I'm phobic of needles and babies so that was NOT a picture I wanted to see.
"<|emo_surprise|> I'd be extremely shocked if we don't get [NAME]. As for [NAME], I don't know much about him"
<|emo_sad|> Whoever told you that is lying.
<|emo_surprise|> And the douche social media obsessed guy who left the used condom on the side table!
<|emo_anger|> There’s a special place in hell for u
<|emo_surprise|> OMG THOSE TINY SHOES! *desire to boop snoot intensifies*
<|emo_anger|> Access should be hindered it's getting destroyed.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME]. The hand mixer instead of forks. Shredding poultry is like my least favorite thing on Earth
<|emo_joy|> I am glad I'm not the only person who noticed that bit of WTFuckery. 🤣
<|emo_joy|> That was indeed a good joke. My penis is happy
<|emo_joy|> Nice job.
<|emo_disgust|> I know it's like this hipster phrase it's so stupid like you're not from the south you dumb motherfuker.
<|emo_anger|> Oh my gosh! I subscribed to both! Thank you so much for the recommendation.
<|emo_fear|> This is terrifying. Good luck to you and your family. Hopefully they figure out who the creepers are very soon.
"<|emo_surprise|> That's amazing, wow! People can be so good."
<|emo_anger|> Every one hates him so your just bragging you hate him too to be cool . Its not a confession unless u say something u regret
"<|emo_joy|> Don’t be clinically depressed, go outside! Be happy! 😊"
<|emo_disgust|> She would betray her friends for chicken nuggets
<|emo_sad|> poor little dude! Glad he's okay. He and his brother have a story to tell now.
<|emo_anger|> VUC YOU IDIOT!!!!
<|emo_fear|> This is the noise I make in my girlfriend’s ear while y’all are still scared to moan
<|emo_surprise|> oh my [NAME]
"<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry. On the plus side, your toilet joke made me laugh really hard. Lol. Thanks"
"<|emo_sad|> To be honest, I have complete sympathy for this woman and she needs help, not prison. "
<|emo_joy|> What fun is this?? I love it!
"<|emo_sad|> Sure, sorry for late response."
<|emo_sad|> toy has lost its value
<|emo_anger|> If I say 6:45 they tell me at 8:00 that they’re not coming :(
<|emo_sad|> Kinda sad but... Okay then
"<|emo_sad|> Lost my kid to the system, wanna see wha the wee lassie has tae say"
<|emo_sad|> just some freak accident with the medicine he was prescribed. He had a seizure
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME], that uniform. At least the Nazi [NAME] had decent fashion sense. This is a crime against fashion"
<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I didn’t know their website was owned by Sinclair. I thought that was just channel 2.
<|emo_joy|> So glad you left and didn’t just sit through the date with that idiot!
<|emo_disgust|> Degloved finger...*ouch*. One of the worst types of avulsions.
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] here...that guac looks horrible
<|emo_joy|> I might get to phaneuf traded levels of joy.
"<|emo_fear|> indeed, but im worried that this matchup will end up as the biggest bait since years and rookie will crush him badly"
"<|emo_disgust|> I am afraid to look, but my morbid curiosity draws me to ask."
"<|emo_sad|> INFP. I’m a very selfless person, which helped me find friends, but not a love interest or a partner"
<|emo_fear|> all the more reason to not give a fuck about CFF
<|emo_fear|> I was petrified...
<|emo_anger|> TRENDY PEOPLE DANCING WITH PRODUCTS
"<|emo_sad|> Sadly no, everything was thrown around the room, and everytime I rebuilt something, it would be annihilated again."
<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry OP but this is all on you. Your parents played you like a $4000 fiddle.
"<|emo_joy|> _Ooh, it looks like we just sold the last one earlier today_"
<|emo_joy|> You'd look like that too if you just saw Snagglepuss going to the bathroom.
<|emo_fear|> I am worried about [NAME]. I really hope that his elbow is alright.
<|emo_joy|> I feel fantastic
<|emo_disgust|> you can't really see the shitty comments on youtube. On instagram it's much easier
"<|emo_surprise|> Hes been amazing, so good I've pondered about playing a 442 with [NAME] and him in the middle"
<|emo_joy|> Definitely better than mine lol. Some good players on there.
<|emo_sad|> I feel the same at 5 feet 9. Feels bad
"<|emo_anger|> I’ll be honest I really don’t care. I’m happy to know that others care about this, but eh you do you"
"<|emo_surprise|> Whoa, wasn't expecting a rational take on this here on reddit. Well done."
<|emo_sad|> They are the best but my office is so far away 😞
<|emo_sad|> This wouldn’t feel so bad if sales and footfall weren’t but many external pressures were keeping profits down.
<|emo_anger|> Y'all taking this way too seriously...the point is they're both fierce.
<|emo_disgust|> Most of the people on here don't really understand basketball. They are usually the people saying we should fire [NAME]
<|emo_sad|> What happened? I can’t stop thinking about this post. Her poor family. Those kids. 😢
<|emo_fear|> I'm now scared to post this link]( I guess I should [stop.
<|emo_anger|> Yeah thank you you ungrateful bast.....
<|emo_anger|> How dare you disparage a 3D printed JV riding a goddamn raptor
"<|emo_anger|> our enemy, the state "
<|emo_anger|> Wow he is... ugly.
"<|emo_surprise|> I love you so much. > **""putas""** Qué eres mi que? (don't how can i translate it)"
<|emo_surprise|> And here I thought it was just my phone... damn what a horrible site.
<|emo_anger|> Fuuuuuuuuuck that.
<|emo_joy|> I have a good feeling about the ability to be a left handed gunslinger.. please Rockstar :(
<|emo_anger|> Overhead fans are absolute shit. They literally do nothing but blow dust around.
"<|emo_joy|> For me, it's tedious and frustrating enough to do it the first time, but I'm glad you enjoy it"
<|emo_surprise|> Thats beyond shockingly bad. A new level of terrible. Wow...
<|emo_joy|> I just had an overabundance of fudge. I took several pounds to my regular dispensary and they were thrilled.
"<|emo_surprise|> One post, 155 updogs. I've seen this raw power only once before."
<|emo_joy|> This made me smile so hard. I am happy for you. May we all find our own happy and worthy constellations 💕
"<|emo_sad|> True, and so sad to see. Somewhere along the way, the governing of a country my mutual consensus turned into a national sport with 2 teams."
<|emo_disgust|> Sucks that [NAME] was a straight positive in important minutes and hasn’t seen the floor since..
"<|emo_disgust|> ""Fascist criticizes another fascist."" Not much to see here."
<|emo_disgust|> HAHA WE ACTUALLY ARE TERRIBLE
<|emo_joy|> If we were in the same city we could've hung out. Happy new year to you. You're not alone in being alone.
<|emo_anger|> Shut up you shill /s
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], prime [NAME] + [NAME] was fun. "
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] that bottom picture. the brows mixed with the hair terrify me 😰
<|emo_fear|> You can’t nag or argue people into a relationship with you.
<|emo_sad|> I was going to say this... he endangered your health
<|emo_disgust|> There is nothing more disgusting than those who put children in danger unless it is the people who allow them to do more harm.
<|emo_joy|> My life is complete
<|emo_anger|> Well this is frustrating.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow! What are the odds of that!?
"<|emo_joy|> Through mutual friends, and online forums. I find out most online shooters are more fun when playing in a party and able to chat."
<|emo_anger|> This genuinely made me angry. He and his sociopath of a wife deserve each other.
<|emo_disgust|> Even this tweet reeks just from the description provided (and the way her friends must look/smell). I’m gagging.
<|emo_sad|> I'm having a hard time understanding what exactly happened. I'm sorry you're having these problems. 🙁
<|emo_surprise|> That's a lot of calories!
"<|emo_fear|> There's no need for anger, but cringe and embarrassment are called for."
<|emo_sad|> My mums been with her second husband 30 odd years now. Second marriages can work but you definitely have to fix and heal yourself first.
<|emo_sad|> WHAT. It says due date 12/31/18. Did she have the kid yet? Oh [NAME] I feel so bad for her and that child...... nooooooo
<|emo_fear|> I'm concerned with optimal health. Not surviving.
<|emo_surprise|> I was wondering this too. Whatever it was it's over now.
"<|emo_disgust|> Yep, it was faked. Too bad, too"
"<|emo_surprise|> I agree with you, I just don't believe it will happen."
<|emo_disgust|> Whoever is breeding and seeking out these inbred animals is vile.
"<|emo_sad|> This is so sad. [NAME], play 'bitch lasagna'"
<|emo_sad|> What's worse is using self destruct without the pilot DLC. You just die :(
"<|emo_anger|> *me Doesn't make any sense if your anxiety is afraid of these things, since it would be scared and go away then. "
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] damn what a comeback. I love this teams fight.
<|emo_surprise|> So glad you got justice and closure. You can properly begin to heal now. I’m not sure I ever will get the same sadly
<|emo_joy|> *[NAME] loved that*
<|emo_sad|> I'm not a gamer but I always feel bad if I kill an ant or some other bug like that for no reason :( instant regret
"<|emo_anger|> I guess ""hungasfuck"" or whatever is not doing gif recipe vids anymore lol"
<|emo_joy|> I kinda love it. Not sure what the theme of the party would be but... its cool.
"<|emo_anger|> Man, these fourth quarters, the Nets are on some [NAME] shit. It just seems mental now"
"<|emo_joy|> The ""YOU SHOT MY MERCEDES?!"" clip is heavily underrated imho. Glad it made the cut for this amazing video."
<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Yes
<|emo_joy|> I’m a millennial and my mortgage payment only takes about 1/5 of my after tax earnings in a month. Feels so good.
"<|emo_disgust|> Fuuuck, brutal"
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, not exactly a complimentary typo. "
"<|emo_fear|> I've have a serious fear of getting winded, this video made my balls fall off "
"<|emo_joy|> Thanks, your comments made me laugh."
<|emo_surprise|> I'm thinking I'd be wondering how I got my hands on a time machine.
<|emo_surprise|> Omg. This is just the best ever. 💜💜💜
"<|emo_joy|> It’s a highly catchy and enjoyable song, I really like it. Not everything should be lyrical miracle spiritual individual music"
"<|emo_disgust|> She can take her boring, drunk husband with her. He's not interesting at all."
<|emo_anger|> WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?!?!?!
<|emo_disgust|> We need to do something about [NAME] because he's fucking my fantasy team up
<|emo_joy|> Happy Another Day random strangers!
<|emo_sad|> Oh jeez I missed that :(
<|emo_anger|> Damn I WANT to hear this!!!
<|emo_anger|> This makes me unfathomably angry.
"<|emo_anger|> Flat out getting our ass kicked. Gotta give it to Memphis, they have just shut us down"
<|emo_surprise|> The claim that whole milk is 40% fat is surprisingly not the most absurd part of this picture. /j
<|emo_sad|> I hope this guy got found and fired. That's way too dangerous. He could have easily killed someone.
<|emo_sad|> I have endured worse.
"<|emo_sad|> Yup, lost a whole train station inside of their houses. Great loss "
<|emo_surprise|> I was surprised when they sewed them together instead of hot gluing them.
<|emo_fear|> Maybe focus on today instead of worrying about eternity? You'll get a lot more out of life that way.
"<|emo_surprise|>  looks unreal, like it's a toy or something."
<|emo_joy|> you are truly a hogwartsian saint and exmo beautiful one. GG
"<|emo_joy|> Damn, good thing I got those experts to tell me that, I'd never have guessed!"
"<|emo_disgust|> I never said they were garbage, just that they come out too frequently."
"<|emo_joy|> I use to play with colored pencils as a child, I also use to play with chapsticks and lipsticks too! They are very entertaining!"
<|emo_disgust|> It's not unique and its decidedly worse.
<|emo_joy|> because it's fun
<|emo_fear|> Looks like they did it to scare everyone else on the road as a dominance game.
"<|emo_disgust|> great weed, terrible vaccination rates."
"<|emo_joy|> r/ThirdSentenceHappy My eyes swelled with tears as I opened the door and watched all 8 puppies, overcome with joy, as they were reunited with their Mother."
"<|emo_fear|> creepy, the only way to make it more creepy is to leave it on her bed stand table to find it in the morning. "
"<|emo_fear|> Yeah, for sure. I've definitely come pretty close to panic attacks at the dentist as well."
"<|emo_anger|> No, what’s sad is saying the same message like it’s news. He’s a copy paste machine. No original thought."
<|emo_disgust|> That might’ve been the worst pass he’s ever thrown. Yikes
<|emo_surprise|> Oh nice I was wondering if you could mix flavours. I'll still stick to mint though 🤷‍♂️
"<|emo_joy|> ""Best prank ever"" :) One of my favorite moments."
<|emo_sad|> Can't relate because the sadness and loneliness is constant 😎
"<|emo_anger|> Fuck it, im paying the premium -- 15% risk in not getting your money is quite high! "
<|emo_disgust|> Just feels rude I guess
"<|emo_fear|> On my first date with my now wife, who is an MD, she said she was intimidated by me. I think it was the suit though!"
"<|emo_joy|> The happiest of birthdays to you, [NAME]!"
"<|emo_fear|> My darling, have you bowed down to worship the ancient one yet? We are very worried. "
<|emo_anger|> It's fucking laurel you god damn yanny hearing fascists.
<|emo_sad|> I have no friends.
<|emo_anger|> Can you stop living with this person? Engaging in it will only make it more toxic
"<|emo_joy|> I'm glad you can relate. I'm glad in a really alienated, empty way. But glad, still. Probably."
<|emo_anger|> Bitch real man just panicking purchases a m82 barret..Now excuse me while i hide from my wife for the next month.
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah, sorry for that one. Some opportunities are too good to pass up."
<|emo_joy|> Crosspost! We're cool with crossposts.
<|emo_sad|> Sadly the Request a Book of [RELIGION] requires a phone number now. But if you have theirs it might work;
<|emo_surprise|> Man you'd be shocked to know some women still remain passive even when married.
"<|emo_joy|> Cheers mate, ill do that!"
"<|emo_disgust|> They understand alright, they just don't give a shit. Bunch of fucking scum."
"<|emo_joy|> So, so many hugs and high fives! You are an awesome momma. "
"<|emo_disgust|> ""Fluoride is mine control!"" ""Why?"" ""Uhhh.."""
<|emo_fear|> What the fuck is that horrifying picture
<|emo_disgust|> Eat my fuck- [NAME]

<|emo_surprise|> Jeepers I should have been asleep two hours ago

<|emo_sad|> Even that game winning kick was close. Our kickers are cursed.
<|emo_sad|> came here to find the person who hasn’t seen this movie so i could feel bad for them

<|emo_anger|> That's the main reason to play [NAME]? I hate it too.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow! That's literally a game changer for me! I'm about to hit 3 digit hours and I never thought of that. Thanks!
"<|emo_joy|> Haha yeah, apparently their ringleader just got banned on Twitter. "
<|emo_anger|> News flash scrims don’t mean shit.

<|emo_joy|> Oh you mean a documentary he produced? I watched it and it felt kinda bias imo

<|emo_sad|> That's really sad. I used to live not far from there and spent a lot of time in that park. Fished in those ponds many times.

<|emo_anger|> It's none of your business. Stay out of it.
"<|emo_joy|> I’m really high and laughed too hard at this video, normally I would feel really bad for the old fella."
<|emo_anger|> The worst thing they risk is having to become a worker.
"<|emo_disgust|> Errr, i didn't want to risk get in trouble with the discipline master, especially since we weren't on good terms at that point in time"
<|emo_anger|> Ouch! My hear sank. Don’t do this to me.

<|emo_fear|> The bot did its job. It’s me the awful one
<|emo_surprise|> The altcoin thread!? This is the first time I've seen it in 6 months.

<|emo_anger|> Who fucking cares. People have sex all the time. You're just an asshole for trying to to profit from it or ruin her.
<|emo_sad|> Thank you for saying this. It is disrespectful to me. And it hurts.

<|emo_joy|> I like how nobody else is doing anything to stop him
"<|emo_anger|> If you're in the Arrowverse, stay away from [NAME] and [NAME]. Swipe motherfucking **left**."

<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] this is atrocious... I think I'm in love

<|emo_joy|> The struggle is real
<|emo_joy|> i’m happy you were able to have a child! that’s my biggest concern.

<|emo_anger|> Son of a bitch... here we go. Can't just stand there guys....
<|emo_anger|> HOLY MOTHER DUCKER
<|emo_anger|> Screw them. We do what we have to do to get our kids to eat.
"<|emo_anger|> The 100,000 who died in the Tokyo bombing during WWII weren't killed by [NAME], it was just the passive spreading of fire. Fuck off, genocide apologist. "
<|emo_joy|> F I had one for a few years. Good times.
<|emo_joy|> Not really. Relying on someone you can't trust is bad. Sometimes relying on someone is the only happiness you'll get.
"<|emo_anger|> He sees you when you’re tweeting, He knows that you’re a fake, He knows that you love [NAME] So resign for goodness sake. "
<|emo_joy|> i love this video

<|emo_anger|> This is almost worse than Santa Con. Can we get millenials to destroy this please.
"<|emo_joy|> Oh I'm contributing mate, don't you worry. The sub clown has been made to look like a knob again! Enjoy your Sunday night x"
"<|emo_disgust|> ummmm Wulp I personally love a feminine man. I prefer it, ‘manly men’ are gross and stupid "
"<|emo_joy|> Hey congrats!! That's amazing, you've done such amazing progress! Hope you have a great day :)"

<|emo_anger|> what the fuck
"<|emo_fear|> you're right, it's all very murky"
"<|emo_sad|> Sad really. Are they really that threatened by people speaking a language? We all speak English everyday, not like we do for sectarian reasons."

<|emo_sad|> Look at that thing...could tear you to shreds
<|emo_fear|> Beyond nightmare!!

<|emo_surprise|> ohhhhh my gosh
<|emo_anger|> oppressed by nature!
<|emo_disgust|> I agree. This is the real reason why I hate wearing pretty clothes and makeup. It's like putting lipstick on a pig.
<|emo_anger|> So no. All you have is lies and delusions. Thanks for the confirmation
<|emo_joy|> I'm having a woosh moment here.
<|emo_anger|> Protip- just smell your damn food. Use your senses!
"<|emo_fear|> Same here, i hope my upcoming trip is gonna kill me"
<|emo_fear|> malicious intentions? what are you talking about?
<|emo_sad|> I was sad to see emails from multiple downtown restaurants offering free delivery through grubhub. Deliveries are going to be brutal.
"<|emo_sad|> Sadly, it ran. :( I hope you're enjoying your trip overseas! :D"

<|emo_fear|> or a horrible night of 15/4/4
"<|emo_joy|> I read this place obsessively and didn't see it, so I'm enjoying it and upvoting it anyway"
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad you got the help you needed. Sorry we couldn't help you here.
"<|emo_anger|> Ok, if that's what you think. I'm just a bystander at this point and laughing at how angry people are getting."
<|emo_sad|> What rights do men have that women don't in the west? Damn.
<|emo_fear|> That’s a horrible take.
<|emo_anger|> Because it would look worse than 2D art.
"<|emo_surprise|> Right, but we want to shit talk them directly. Not agree with other people shit talking them."
<|emo_disgust|> LOL! You're fucked.
<|emo_joy|> 9Gag was my jam back in high school! Pleasure to meet an alumni

<|emo_anger|> Classic sloth fuckboi
"<|emo_sad|> Oh god, never thought of the implications of [NAME] not selling BB-8 as mirroring her parents giving her up. That tugs the heartstrings a little bit."
"<|emo_anger|> I hate the message that's being pushed, and it's even worse that it's being pushed by this guy."
"<|emo_joy|> Well they both have a bit of a graspy type voice, but yeah... XD"

"<|emo_disgust|> I feel awful posting it, but I couldn’t not share :|"

<|emo_sad|> Nothing new is happening. Society never gave a fck about broken men. So it's only natural.
"<|emo_anger|> Exactly, she wasn't ""venting"", she was abusing his fiancee. "
<|emo_surprise|> Oh a cat !
<|emo_surprise|> Wow [NAME] retained NO combat skills from the time he was [NAME] to help him fight Cicada at that bar
<|emo_disgust|> So deport the bad guys and let the asylum seekers come in. Sounds like we don’t need a wall anyway.
"<|emo_anger|> Do you have any non anecdotal stuff to say or? Also burden of proof is a thing, you made a claim, prove it or fuck off"
<|emo_joy|> Found my flair.
<|emo_sad|> - (sorry) -
"<|emo_disgust|> The [RELIGION] Church has been raping children for decades, that we know about. More likely hundreds of years. Probably since they've existed. "
<|emo_joy|> This literally made my day!
"<|emo_fear|> This sounds an awful lot like a solicitation. In case it isn't, what you seek may exist but you'd probably have better luck with the lottery."
"<|emo_anger|> The fuck? Come from nothing, now something doesn't matter? "
"<|emo_anger|> It's racism. It doesn't make me angry, it makes me feel sorry for their ignorance and yours."
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] was piss poor today
"<|emo_joy|> Well, to them that probably was the polite term! That's funny though lol"
<|emo_sad|> My husband and I have been circling the drain for years. :(
<|emo_joy|> Nice try hom... oh no it’s real this time D:
<|emo_fear|> it is not so simple. lacking hormones makes things difficult to deal with when they otherwise would be bearable.
<|emo_anger|> No because thats stupid
<|emo_sad|> It’s oddly unsatisfying when someone beats me to saying that.
<|emo_fear|> Scary times we live in.
<|emo_fear|> I want to so bad it hurts. I guess I'm just scared.
<|emo_sad|> I actually want to die rn. I don't want to watch the SB but I know I'm going to.
<|emo_anger|> It's a photograph with one of our greatest ever defender and captain. What's your problem?
<|emo_joy|> Nah. Enjoy your free food
"<|emo_fear|> I'm terrible sorry, /u/bookluvr83, but I'm afraid I must join up with the giving-you-crap-for-not-liking-brownies bandwagon. ^kidding ^^^kinda"
<|emo_joy|> ? sometimes i play ffa with my friends to have fun
<|emo_surprise|> > super model strange Oh man
<|emo_joy|> She looks almost devoid of color. Kinda like a manga. Amazing.
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] are you me? Like I was relating and then you said rot in Atlanta traffic and the pains of 285 burned into my mind.
<|emo_surprise|> It was shocking to me when I realized this! Best of luck on your journey!
<|emo_sad|> Same here. It’s very hard. I really feel for you.
<|emo_disgust|> That was so disgusting. VWP
<|emo_joy|> I've played around pretty extensively with this mod in [NAME] mode with friends. I'd recommend it.
"<|emo_joy|> Cheers, guys! We are never drinking alone when we are here! But in person, I love drinking alone. "
<|emo_disgust|> You’re an awful troll...
<|emo_joy|> THE PACK RUNS DEEP AND HARD. I WOULD SHARE MY KRAFT MAC AND CHEESE WITH YOU ANY DAY. AROOOOOOOOO
<|emo_anger|> Hell yeah. I'm really just thinking about the irony and double standard of the Left. It's amazing that these people are that cognitive dissonant.
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]’ ego has turned him into such a bully. He seems to get off lately on witch-hunting and encouraging his “sisters” to harass people.
<|emo_surprise|> I always wondered where it was on ormond. I managed to find the toolbox last week on yamaoka as killer.
<|emo_surprise|> It’s shocking isn’t it? I paid less for a flight from London to Manchester than it would have cost for the train.
<|emo_anger|> I had smoothies in the past with these packets. Solid as fuck. Dragonfruit one too.
<|emo_surprise|> What have I watched ?! My eyes!!! Mom!!!
<|emo_surprise|> They killed [NAME] for being a [NAME] right after this. [NAME] was a notorious anti-Semite.
<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit it actually did... how
"<|emo_joy|> The guy filming creeped me out with his internet obsession. “6million views, junior, think about that! Wooo-oo-weeee :D!!!” "
"<|emo_anger|> never, because I actually married someone I wanted to be with l, and didn’t fucking betray their trust, unlike you arseholes "
"<|emo_joy|> I'm just glad they'll chill out in the main sub, they were swarmin."
"<|emo_surprise|> People are still playing bf1?Wow thats nice,I should play some games until more content drops for bf5."
<|emo_surprise|> Oh hell no
"<|emo_joy|> I really hope we see another fighter like him he was so fun to watch, a fighting machine with that killer instinct"
<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry for your loss
<|emo_sad|> Yeah definitely not like my welder boyfriends hands for sure
<|emo_surprise|> She's getting younger and younger. Which wouldn't be that big of a deal if this post didn't exist
<|emo_anger|> Next time something like this happens tell them it's illegal to pet a working service dog and they could be sent to jail for it
<|emo_sad|> Very under rated.
"<|emo_anger|> Wow. Forget the separation, lawyer up and go straight to divorce. "
"<|emo_anger|> Holy fuck, report this now. The fuck you doing on reddit? "
<|emo_joy|> I would love it! [NAME] has a history of injuries just like [NAME] used to!!! Do it!!
<|emo_sad|> I feel your pain...
<|emo_anger|> It’s merch everyone calm down - she’s using the season 11 hype to get attention
"<|emo_disgust|> I don’t really have much to say. There’s a bad idea, and there’s straight up disgusting."
<|emo_disgust|> I work for the Hilton company I’m disgusted they would let this happen outside one of their hotels if they had any ounce of control.
<|emo_joy|> Wow grats man. Hopefully I can use this inspiration for myself tomorrow. If there was something new you learned in this experience would share it?
<|emo_joy|> Also op I have my associates on top of my bachelors? Whatchu mean
<|emo_anger|> dude people here can be assholes. there’s nothing wrong with taking a break.
<|emo_joy|> This would be perfect for a new sub sound
<|emo_anger|> Hey fuck-o I've broken plenty of rules I just have the decency to be ashamed of it.
<|emo_disgust|> I'm using mine on the Consumer Cellular customers that come in mad at me because they have to set up an Apple Account to use their IPhone.
<|emo_sad|> Too bad =(
"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was struggling against the taller Sixer's guards, got swatted on a lot of drives too even with [NAME] out with injury. "
<|emo_disgust|> Fuckin Finnish spitz out there bud
"<|emo_sad|> > Is it weird to have more sympathy for animals than humans? It's frighteningly common, so not *weird*, but it's definitely sad"
"<|emo_joy|> Everything he does makes me love him, including his video application for his job at Polygon which is art."
<|emo_sad|> I’m ashamed to look at how much time I spend on Reddit
"<|emo_joy|> Cheers, mate! I know you can do it! :)"
"<|emo_surprise|> Shit, with a full season of [NAME] on the docket? Yes please."
"<|emo_joy|> Could be worse, could be funky town"
"<|emo_disgust|> Yah, totally. It's just kind of scary when all you hear are loud extremes on both sides. "
<|emo_surprise|> Humans are weird creatures
<|emo_surprise|> Sounds like there is market demand for this service. Some innovative rideshare company should take advantage.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh hell no. Shes blind!!! No way in HELL is she ever being left alone with it.
<|emo_disgust|> That was an incredibly dumb thing to do. [NAME] is an idiot for trusting her.
"<|emo_anger|> Yeah man, gotta suck it up and be a man. /s"
<|emo_disgust|> It's clearly a terrible policy.
<|emo_joy|> You seem fun
<|emo_disgust|> You laugh at them. Openly. For being childish and naive. If they don’t react to facts maybe they’ll react to wounded pride.
<|emo_fear|> Confirmation sounds really scary and sketchy. I can not not think about cults and rituals everytime...
<|emo_surprise|> i am. This means i will move from MTN to VODACOM. and i only roam!! Wow
"<|emo_disgust|> Skip the middle man, squish them up my anus and vomit out the skins and seed"
"<|emo_disgust|> ""This droid has a bad motivator."""
<|emo_anger|> No you pick a different hero. Aint fkn rocket science.
<|emo_anger|> How? The feds shut down Craigslist
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]? Rape? I am shocked I tell you! SHOCKED!
"<|emo_anger|> As someone who works in the oil industry with a lot of big ships, this is badass."
<|emo_joy|> This communities inability to understand sarcasm is absolutely awe inspiring.
<|emo_sad|> Damn sorry to hear bro. You guys still friends though?
"<|emo_disgust|> I just hate the ""I don't know"" people"
<|emo_surprise|> What an idiot.
"<|emo_joy|> i'm not that into shower sex tho. like it's fun sometimes, but it takes me so long to get off when i'm wet."
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] is scared out there. Didnt want the ball
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] comment has me laughing
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] just think of how overworked her liver and kidneys must be!!
<|emo_disgust|> Your husband isn’t at all worried about your reputation since he’s the one who spread the lie. Something to think about
<|emo_fear|> I’m going to die right now I’m so scared tears and snot everywhere
<|emo_anger|> Only issue I have is that tiramisu is a beautifully layered cake and all of that is hidden by the container
"<|emo_surprise|> Haha I’m not expecting anything at considering they’re 2,000 miles away from me. I’ll be surprised if she does give me numbers,"
<|emo_joy|> Enjoy the ahuahuasca
<|emo_anger|> Fuuuuck. I feel this. In my core.
<|emo_anger|> Hopefully you get a good bashing soon
<|emo_joy|> You’re welcome
<|emo_anger|> omg that's gonna be a hell of a reunion as well
<|emo_surprise|> Wow this basically means that 99%of bolliwood movies are basically documentaries! This changes everything!
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] Damn [NAME]
"<|emo_fear|> I was so hyped after the zach shot, I'm still crying "
<|emo_joy|> Glad you had fun! Your gf sounds like a keeper!
"<|emo_sad|> I'd say it was a rather critical observation, so yeah, scrutiny."
"<|emo_disgust|> And the new sword is kinda shitty, and not even a complete sword at that price. Also, the sword is really bad for the environment."
<|emo_fear|> The weak should fear the strong
<|emo_surprise|> I was wondering what that was!
"<|emo_fear|> I understand that the fear that you will need to have surgery is very upsetting. But, there is no legal case here. "
<|emo_anger|> It makes sense to me. I am a republican in that sense but hate the GOP for the most part.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh hell no. Shes blind!!! No way in HELL is she ever being left alone with it.
<|emo_joy|> Wow I’m glad I live in Cali
<|emo_disgust|> All I can think of is her sweaty mom cooking away in the back 🤮
<|emo_fear|> Unsure if OP is serious or just being sarcastic. I can't decide?
"<|emo_surprise|> Hmm, I didn't notice that change ... will pay attention .."
<|emo_sad|> > it will not make her look like an idiot It would be hard to make her look any more like an idiot than she already does.
"<|emo_fear|> [NAME], that is so horrible. I’m so sorry for you and OP."
<|emo_sad|> I'm so sorry that [NAME] has convinced you that his insane aggression isn't important.
<|emo_disgust|> That's way dangerous to keep then together they may break out and start feedig on the other ear buds to gain heir strength
<|emo_anger|> How can they expect you to write if you can't read? /s
<|emo_sad|> .... That literally made my stomach clench. I can't believe they are charged for the samples... Just eww.
<|emo_surprise|> I thought this allegation was squashed when it came out. I was surprised to see it still making headlines. Poor guy.
<|emo_sad|> Worst feeling ever
<|emo_disgust|> lol eat your own farts Trumpkin
<|emo_sad|> Ketamine is absolutely bizarre in high doses. I lack the words to really describe it. I've never felt so detatched from my own humanity.
<|emo_anger|> Fight me coward! I will never ne frego!
<|emo_anger|> Dont keep your mouth shut.
<|emo_joy|> All jokes aside my birthday is January 2nd as well if yours really is
"<|emo_anger|> Which sucks, because it's a *bitch* to find replacements for those."
<|emo_surprise|> You quack!
<|emo_anger|> Understood - PM was all gears and no downtime. Last thing I would want is another bloody job like that. Cheers
<|emo_disgust|> For both of you together? The fuck company are you using.
<|emo_anger|> Who is your least hated and absolute worst? (Outfit based only)
<|emo_surprise|> I skimmed poorly and thought it said 4 people (independently) discovered their data was accessed
<|emo_anger|> I related to [NAME] so much in this moment. I hate that [NAME] gone when he reaches for him.
<|emo_joy|> They both crazy
<|emo_surprise|> I’m surprised by how quickly they were able to get a graphic for Kent.
"<|emo_joy|> Here, here. Cheers to starting fresh!"
"<|emo_joy|> I would start laughing, screaming seems inappropriate"
<|emo_joy|> I remember running into teachers at the grocery store or whatever when I was a little kid and having that same feeling!
<|emo_sad|> You know I’m sad the [NAME] hype is over because I actually think he’s been really good for us overall. I still trust him.
<|emo_anger|> So bad its funny
<|emo_anger|> I’m just gonna go ahead and call bullshit on most of the details of this story.
"<|emo_joy|> > His face, mate. He thought he was a goner. Properly lol'd at that and reading all [NAME]' bits in his accent"
<|emo_joy|> My wife enjoys marking me. We just make sure they are below the collar line.
<|emo_disgust|> WHAT A DISGUSTING START
<|emo_anger|> Why is this here?
<|emo_anger|> This game is a pain in the ass. There are few things as infuriating as getting dicked by 3s all game. Flashbacks to the 2nd Orlando game.
"<|emo_joy|> We’re playing well, except for a 2 minute stretch. As is tradition"
"<|emo_anger|> You better go to a church tomorrow and repent..also, tell the Pastor what happened. I am serious. "
<|emo_disgust|> I'll take the downvotes and agree with you. Some of the ugliest looking things I've ever seen. Absolutely disgusting aesthetic.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh really?
<|emo_sad|> >[NAME] Well he forgot to save me from the 'word of hella'.
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] my God. That was the best free throw shooting ive ever seen.
"<|emo_anger|> As a BMW owner, I don't understand what this meme is even talking about."
<|emo_fear|> Battlefront 2 could be a horror game
<|emo_fear|> Please elaborate on that story! Ive always been afraid of exactly this happening to me.
"<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry, but that poor kitty looks miserable."
<|emo_disgust|> This is one of the worst I've seen...
<|emo_sad|> That's terrible. I'm sorry for your loss.
<|emo_anger|> It was salt. This is the laziest ‘dish’ I have ever ordered in my life.
<|emo_sad|> This is the saddest thing I've seen today
<|emo_sad|> Typically the speeches come from a functional adult. The Idiot is an unindicted co-conspirator with a visible personality disorder. Feigning normalcy is part of what's wrong.
"<|emo_surprise|> ""cool little surprise"" ow youtubers: NEW HERO NEW SKINS NEW MAPS NEXT WEEK?!"
<|emo_disgust|> You have to spit into a plastic vial. It would take some decent effort to pull that off.

<|emo_disgust|> Praise [NAME] your taste is bad /s
<|emo_anger|> This is just child abuse. At least the whole food withdrawal and beatings.
<|emo_disgust|> It's just bizarre you would criticize [NAME] on his development capabilities when he's not a developer... His specialties are centered around crypto philosophy
<|emo_sad|> another one of those chicks sacrificing her children for a man and 'happiness'
<|emo_fear|> That's what I'm afraid of but I don't have a lot of free time so it would never work.
<|emo_disgust|> Stop being disgusting. I dont know if you know this but all dogs are naked.
"<|emo_sad|> Her face right befoe this needs to join the meme economy. The ""I'll regret this for years to come"" face."
<|emo_joy|> Yep. He also said it’d happen on a Manbij patrol
<|emo_surprise|> Is there a sub reddit for targeted memes like this?
<|emo_surprise|> The shocking conclusion.
<|emo_surprise|> There is a startling lack of empathy in this thread.
<|emo_disgust|> When you can see the redzone interception coming 5 seconds before it was thrown.
"<|emo_sad|> Dude, your mentally handicapped post history. /I'm ignoring ya it's all good"
<|emo_anger|> That's a pretty cool way to die.
<|emo_disgust|> This is a weird thing to be concerned about.
<|emo_anger|> That was such awful bandaid application. Like what the fuck.
"<|emo_sad|> Alright, so I googled aaaaaaand sorry for my misinformed mistake. Dunno where I heard that [NAME] didn't win the popular vote but it was wrong :("
<|emo_fear|> I might be in trouble in this case. I have 7 years going on 8 :(
"<|emo_joy|> INFJ hands down ""Being organised brings joy to me"""
<|emo_joy|> That's why I'm glad they got [NAME].
<|emo_disgust|> What a weird thing to say.
"<|emo_disgust|> It's not his fault, it's your wife's. Shes the one you need to be pissed at"

"<|emo_anger|> If this is actually real it is really fucking stupid.. 400mg of nicotine!? Clearly you're looking for something stronger, might as well try heroin.."
<|emo_sad|> Omg TDG has a new singer? That's so sad. I was rocking out to them in middle school too. Simpler times.
<|emo_anger|> Please stop talking [NAME].
"<|emo_surprise|> ""Didn't know you can predict the future"""
"<|emo_anger|> No more [NAME] from Georgia. Suck it you old, ugly hag."
<|emo_anger|> What in the hell are you talking about? I've never said that
<|emo_anger|> What in the actual fuck....
<|emo_fear|> Facial hair ability: [NAME] Looks like [NAME] got a bloody nose a week ago and hasn’t washed the blood out yet.
"<|emo_surprise|> wow this seems like a huge ᴡᴀsᴛᴇ ᴏ- ᴡᴀɪᴛ ᴀ ᴍɪɴᴜᴛᴇ. ɴᴏ, ᴛʜɪs ɪs ɢᴏᴏᴅ"
"<|emo_joy|> Wow, I’m going to have to remember this one..."

<|emo_joy|> I am going to be so happy when they finally air that scaly foot Dr Pimple Popper episode because I’m tired of seeing it every five minutes.
<|emo_joy|> hahaha [NAME]???
<|emo_disgust|> that was an ugly 5v3
<|emo_anger|> Maybe [NAME].
"<|emo_fear|> ugh, same. it also gave me the shakes, so I quit. so far, I've found Trintellix to be a nice compromise"
<|emo_surprise|> Oh really?
<|emo_sad|> ☠️ I felt his pain!!!☠️ R.I.P. furry giblets!!!!☹️
<|emo_surprise|> Omg this is so cool thank you!
"<|emo_anger|> In all fairness Ive said it to men, woman, and children. Nobody is outside of my blind rage."
<|emo_surprise|> The show paid for [NAME] surprise trip didn't they?

<|emo_fear|> We all are afraid of losing our jobs here or being blackballed all the same.
<|emo_surprise|> Probably. I am surprised Reddit doesn't just purge all right leaning subs.
"<|emo_surprise|> Not one bit surprising, yet also not really a men’s rights issue"
<|emo_disgust|> to google cuz I wasn't alive back then but damn I like em.
<|emo_joy|> Once we win week 1 next season this sub will turn around lol
"<|emo_fear|> Eh, 3. I don't know why. I told him this but he's afraid his life is ruined."
<|emo_sad|> She's already promised her kids they can have it and now all four of them are crying!
<|emo_anger|> Not to be the joke of the entire league
<|emo_anger|> And it is always because of a dropped combo that should have killed

<|emo_joy|> And I like the taste

<|emo_disgust|> 80% of the country is putting their faith in a man who doesn’t even have personal awareness of where he is.
<|emo_fear|> Maybe so. Should I try to ask her about it? I'm worried that will only scare her more
"<|emo_sad|> I binged that podcast in about 2 days at work. Amazing. The convention for Limelight, and how emotional they got for those poor women was heartbreaking."
<|emo_joy|> The rest areas and truck stops are booming!
<|emo_disgust|> Their numbers seem large because they get so much publicity. But I suspect that even most young people find that ludicrous.

"<|emo_anger|> You fucking got this bb, one step at a time. The DD is here for you."
"<|emo_anger|> just apologize. what other advice could you possibly require? you fucked up, now deal with it."
<|emo_sad|> I like [NAME] but he was just non-existent tonight. At least [NAME] played defense.
<|emo_disgust|> If only life was a garbage isekai anime. Too bad the genre is just pandering and blatant self-insert/wish fulfillment. Oh well.
<|emo_sad|> Someone who’s to sad and empty to care about toast... me I guess?
"<|emo_surprise|> Knew someone at that actual party, according to them he was talked into doing it by Odd Future members not sure who tho"
<|emo_sad|> Sorry you are having such trouble.
"<|emo_sad|> It's so sad that people don't vaccinate their children. For every upvote to this post, I'll vaccinate my child in protest. "
<|emo_sad|> It pains me to see [NAME] used in this abhorrent meme

<|emo_fear|> Could you imagine? That would be so terrible for viewers. 😂
<|emo_anger|> What an immature response. With a little passive agressive racism to boot. Classy.
<|emo_joy|> My new favorite phrase.

<|emo_surprise|> 5’8ish my guess. The one thing that blew me away I went to a COD event was how short majority of pro’s are
"<|emo_surprise|> If you’ve never been to DSA you’d be surprised by how many amazing, smart people you’ll meet. "
<|emo_disgust|> It was on a washed out road in the at 2am. Which makes it even worse. They never should have been towing that vic.
"<|emo_surprise|> You're saying some surprisingly stupid things for someone named ""[NAME]."""
<|emo_sad|> This is awful and borderline abuse. I can't imagine thinking that's even slightly okay
<|emo_surprise|> Really surprised I had to come this far down to find this!
<|emo_sad|> so doing something illegal only dehumanises you when caught?
<|emo_disgust|> Disgusting performance. [NAME] appears clueless.
<|emo_anger|> At least you should have helped out since you had rudely interrupted him.
<|emo_disgust|> So smart it looks like he shut his fingers in the door. That’s a nasty bruise under his fingernail.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow another person in Dunedin uses Reddit
<|emo_joy|> I went to your profile to see the other pics & saw your kitty. He's super cute!
<|emo_joy|> Congrats I’m very happy for your happy ending. Wish you guys many many years of happiness together
<|emo_joy|> Happy birthday [NAME] !
<|emo_joy|> I met [NAME] and he actually DID give me 40 dollars...I worked at a movie theater near where he lives and he bought snacks.

<|emo_fear|> I’m as terrified of Mr. [NAME] just as much as any sane person but I don’t think we should *burn* him...
<|emo_anger|> Wouldn't have it any other way. Fuck my DNA. Fuck nucleotides.
<|emo_sad|> Huh. Siege is still a thing. I miss the old days. :(
<|emo_joy|> I'm also happy you're still here!!
<|emo_disgust|> These people are so full of hate it's disgusting and disheartening at the same time. How do you de-radicalize these people?
<|emo_anger|> Damn it!
<|emo_fear|> I went to the avenues once. I was murdered twice in one day and they stole my grandma's jewellery from her grave in Minnesota!
<|emo_anger|> the fuck? I would do it in a heart beat. ya'll nuts if you think [NAME] will draft any better than [NAME]
<|emo_anger|> I will call the police if you dont stop harassing me
"<|emo_joy|> Had one good year that was it, then joins a god squad that struggles to qualify"
<|emo_surprise|> That’s a terrible amount of bp for 11 kills
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] living her best life in Germany.
"<|emo_anger|> Starting super simple helps; compliment strangers! Nothing else - smile, compliment and keep walking your merry way. Hell of a confidence booster too "
<|emo_sad|> And I’ll admit I am insane for allowing it to happen but the passion I have for this guy makes it hard to cut off all contact.
<|emo_anger|> The bourgeoisie elected courts were going to backtrack on all [NAME] economic reforms. Fuck those guys.
<|emo_joy|> The realization is pretty grim. Can't say I'm terribly happy.
<|emo_sad|> You'd think we don't have anymore tears already... It's been 62 years of crying.
"<|emo_sad|> It is funny and sad, when faced with the option to laugh or cry I choose laugh"
<|emo_disgust|> that sounds disgustingly sweet and yet i want to try it
"<|emo_anger|> Dig up, stupid! "
<|emo_anger|> Omg [NAME] he’s there because you don’t listen. You ass!
<|emo_anger|> It’s fine. Baby boomers are always angry
<|emo_joy|> Oceania is my favorite Smashing Pumpkins album
<|emo_fear|> Even more so. It would only make our prison (this world) even more diabolical.
<|emo_sad|> An entire family gone within minutes... how absolutely heartbreaking.
<|emo_sad|> Every time I think about how close we were to getting [NAME] it hurts a little bit more...
"<|emo_anger|> damn you're prolly right. only character i actually hate is [NAME], i'll use a different word"
<|emo_disgust|> It’s so fucking creepy
<|emo_joy|> I like it
"<|emo_disgust|> I don't think so. [NAME] can't even stand, how can he fuck? "
<|emo_joy|> I'll have a look and see if I can find it. Cheers for the info!
<|emo_joy|> Dude just get them drunk.
"<|emo_sad|> Oh wow, I feel bad for the parents, they had no idea"
"<|emo_joy|> The possibilities are fascinating. In other times, I'd be enjoying watching the lawyers argue...!"
<|emo_surprise|> The surprise would be that we just broke a 16 year old record...
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME], oh no, no no no"
"<|emo_anger|> You know I’m not the only one that stole a meme and posted it in other subreddit, right? "
<|emo_fear|> I'm sorry you felt alone. It's a terrible suffocating feeling of dread. I hope you are feeling better and that you are in good health
<|emo_surprise|> My 1 year old ate TWENTY TWO broccoli tots for lunch. And he still wanted a cookie afterwards. Like...what?!
<|emo_joy|> yes and I'm glad that this nonsense stops with me
<|emo_fear|> Imagine your daughter running away from home. I think that's a pretty terrifying idea without some murderer or mystic horror
"<|emo_anger|> Bloody forking shirtballs! This has to be some kind of ""The Good Place"" / Bad Place repost robomod bullshort. "
<|emo_joy|> It pays well and I enjoy it. I travel 6 months a year. For the last 16 years.
<|emo_anger|> This just oozes passive-agressiveness. I love it!

<|emo_surprise|> wait they actually lost lmao. i stopped watching halfway cuz i thought SPY had it in the bag ^^^^andigotmywatchrewards

<|emo_sad|> I actually laughed my ass off so hard i had tears. Well done creator!!
<|emo_fear|> s p o o k y
<|emo_joy|> You'd love to meet my in-laws...
"<|emo_anger|> It's a cruel, uncaring universe we live in. Fingers crossed things won't completely fall apart for them."
"<|emo_anger|> As someone who hates wake up dragon punches, this made me hard"
"<|emo_disgust|> Believe you me. TLJ is much, much worse."
<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe he told that story. I'm sure the minister that released the water is now so totally regretting not asking for a bj!
"<|emo_disgust|> Laughing at ""indoctrinated by traditional values"". Good luck in life."
"<|emo_disgust|> Thats awful, I'm so sorry for your loss"
<|emo_surprise|> Oh. I never heard that before.
<|emo_anger|> I hate everything about this.
<|emo_sad|> That must hurt
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad you got the help you needed. Sorry we couldn't help you here.

<|emo_disgust|> I wishhhh. She’s honestly what started getting me the fuck away from centrism
<|emo_fear|> Ugh. This is horrifying. Thank you for sharing.
<|emo_anger|> BUT ATHEISTS ARE DOING THE SAME THING AND ARE TREATED BETTER. No. You're just being a bigot.
<|emo_fear|> Too bad [NAME] is a bad person if abandoned and tries to kill you as well. Her singing was really nice..
<|emo_anger|> But OP said her life is ruined because 'muricans are bad.
"<|emo_sad|> Also, on my phone this didn't show up as a ""cross post"". Sorry!"
<|emo_joy|> Cheers! *clink*
<|emo_sad|> I’m sorry but [NAME] has better memes
"<|emo_anger|> I want a sense of progression and accomplishment in overwatch, something golden guns and skins dont give me anymore :)"
<|emo_sad|> I just need [NAME] to retire already so I can stop hating on him and appreciate all he's done... Even if it has caused me great suffering.
<|emo_sad|> Too bad they lost.
"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, it’d be weird to have two green arrows running around. "
<|emo_surprise|> It's sad that we have to think of it as a miracle and not a regular occurrence :/
"<|emo_joy|> Yay, coming out is hard, you're lucky that they didnt avoid you for the next month, I'm happy for you"
<|emo_fear|> I’m literally shaking right now😫
<|emo_anger|> I can’t stand this arrogant prick he’s no better thenFord in Ontario and that guy is a buffoon
<|emo_joy|> I agree. The funny part *is* the funny part.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I wasnt expecting that to be a real sub lol that's awesome"
<|emo_sad|> It also makes me cry! but because it shows how far [NAME] has fallen...
<|emo_anger|> Bold of you to assume that I have two other friends
<|emo_fear|> But everybody got mad when Russia recognized [NAME] as US president. Go figure.
"<|emo_joy|> One of my favorite post fight moments, [NAME] is a funny guy. "
"<|emo_joy|> Nae bother, Happy to bring musical joy in to any household....."
"<|emo_disgust|> If it was low-fat mayonnaise, their response may have been justified. That stuff is horrendous."
<|emo_sad|> I feel for you (at a title 1 middle school in lausd) I had a tough day today and reading this made me feel a little better ✊🏼
"<|emo_fear|> I had a nightmare about something similar, the combination of high walls and water is truly scary"
<|emo_sad|> I’ve been hurt too many times for it all to have been for nothing
<|emo_joy|> Lol what do you mean ☺️☺️☺️
"<|emo_sad|> I might be missing a joke myself, but woosh."
<|emo_joy|> Well [NAME] just missed...so there’s that bit of good news
<|emo_sad|> Must be nice my seats were in that area... sadly I decided to go to the bathroom. #PTSD
<|emo_anger|> And you act like [RELIGION] wasn’t used to fuel slavery and control slaves go off tho...
<|emo_disgust|> And there I was blaming the poor black lads
<|emo_surprise|> Woo hoo!
<|emo_disgust|> You would know if you weren't such a Filthy Ricefield Peasant.
"<|emo_surprise|> AYY! Anti-Semitism! Didn't expect that from AnCaps, but I'm not surprised."

<|emo_sad|> [NAME] even eluded to the fact that his mom was a bit put off by her age after asking it.
"<|emo_anger|> No sir, can’t hold them over a bowl for shit. Plus they make blunts taste weird."
<|emo_anger|> Nice of them to call back to [NAME] dyslexia with the two different spellings of deodorant
<|emo_anger|> Don't use gay as an insult.
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah we're just awful. Sadly that's too friggin' true just now!
<|emo_anger|> Stop laughing at me.
<|emo_anger|> That must be so frustrating. Sounds like he’s digging his heels in and refusing to accept his faults.
<|emo_fear|> I understand it but still can't ask questions. I am too afraid
<|emo_anger|> /uj this looks fucking delicious
<|emo_joy|> Finally got this in the mail today. I'm pretty excited. My favorite ballplayer.
"<|emo_sad|> Yup. I feel you. I'm very sorry it happened to you, too."
<|emo_disgust|> This is repulsive what the fuck is wrong with places like this. It does have an element of hilarity tho
<|emo_anger|> We have seven fucking billion and more people bork every day !!
"<|emo_fear|> I was so scared, I thought the kid was going to backpedal into a street."
<|emo_fear|> That sounds terrible.
"<|emo_sad|> I'm a little sad that there's not actually a video called Dance of the Hillary, virus or not."
<|emo_anger|> This just makes me angry.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that's awesome you heard that in the wild."
<|emo_disgust|> That was nasty... but also the most real thing I’ve seen on the show lately.. lol
<|emo_joy|> Glad I took the 1st half spread
<|emo_sad|> I still pick the femboi sorry
<|emo_anger|> What the hell kind of university schedules a class at 6am?
"<|emo_sad|> I doubt people are *happy*, but they probably aren’t sad about someone who was potentially endangering others through their anti-science views."
<|emo_surprise|> I would be so pissed if I was part of that coaching staff. That was unbelievable.
<|emo_surprise|> Wasn’t it 99% of the WORLD’S population? Like how in the fuck is that even possible...
<|emo_joy|> I understand. Just know that I'm here. I've been through hell and back. I am happy to listen to anything.
<|emo_fear|> I feel horrible for the government workers caught in the middle of this. I hope it ends soon.
<|emo_fear|> I took a picture of a farmer treating his crops with roundup yesterday.. it was horrifying
"<|emo_sad|> All the inmates, including serial killers: *'Someone save me from this psycho.'*"
"<|emo_sad|> ah thats my bad, she just finished the blog and im sharing it around, one sec and ill edit it. "
<|emo_sad|> Just so freaking miserable. Trying to make me miserable as well
<|emo_surprise|> **WAIT THAT WAS A REAL STORY!?!?!? WHAT THE FUCK**
"<|emo_surprise|> Whoa, should've said that in the post. Threats is not good. I'd find a way to live away from him asap. "
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME] all at top tier make me happy"
<|emo_fear|> Oh my god Del Monico. Horrific. Even the ambient smell in the hallways makes me gag.
<|emo_joy|> Well good for you man. Enjoy :)
<|emo_surprise|> 5 hours late!!!!!!!!! omg.
<|emo_anger|> “Children transing is abuse though ... and I'm not even speaking about dangers of hrt”
<|emo_anger|> Read the rules. Coming in here screaming “Muh [NAME]!” is spam.
<|emo_joy|> Let us celebrate with a glass of kerbango.
"<|emo_disgust|> oh i wish i didn't read that, [NAME]"
"<|emo_sad|> 5'11"" [NAME]. He's basically 6 foot, so I must be missing something here."
"<|emo_joy|> OHHHH, I like where Richmond is going with that."
<|emo_joy|> Love hearing stories like this. [NAME] holy Priests are such a gift. We must always give thanks and pray for them.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you must've never been on /pol/ or like dozens of anti [NAME] subreddits."
<|emo_sad|> Damn that’s sad
<|emo_surprise|> What?! And you’re not a vegetable?! /s
"<|emo_fear|> Only if the fights are between chimpanzees. [NAME], those things will tear you to shreds"
<|emo_disgust|> My poor space bar takes an awful bashing with all the pausing in a Squidge vid
<|emo_anger|> Just get pissed next time he asks and tell him to fuck off Some people just think they can take advantage of people who help them
<|emo_disgust|> I bet he jerks off while holding a gun in his mouth while crying.
<|emo_disgust|> You should be embarrassed. Not only because you are a adulterer but because you are a pedo for thinking of your son.
<|emo_anger|> Wait is this a euphemism for ditching your husband and finding a new partner or did you lose 179 pounds?!?!
<|emo_anger|> That sentence should be illegal.
<|emo_joy|> Thank you! I'm so glad you liked it! I did finally get a new belt lol
<|emo_disgust|> The jackets that we have so many people wore so they’re musty as hell
<|emo_disgust|> too damn often!! and i’m cute as hell! i’m mad!!
<|emo_disgust|> Anyone that actually takes the train daily can tell you that. And I do feel its getting worse.
<|emo_sad|> Glad I could help but it's not mine. I'm just passing it on.
<|emo_anger|> Nothing more Jersey than the sound of car horns over [NAME] rambling out an annoyed answer to a caller.
<|emo_anger|> There are racist morons everywhere.
<|emo_sad|> Finally somewhere where I'm just an average fucking person Fuck why am I crying
<|emo_disgust|> Lol I hate this too!
<|emo_sad|> Too bad it's the wrong kind of blows!!!
<|emo_disgust|> People need to stop excusing bad behavior
<|emo_surprise|> Company car? Oh boy he’s in trouble now.
<|emo_fear|> I was told ignar was going to be awful by this sub.
"<|emo_disgust|> Tried to fight multiple times, cried, fallen over, and refused to eat... Sounds like my toddlers..."
<|emo_surprise|> Pretty normal! I have a friend who is exactly the same :)
<|emo_disgust|> Oh boy I was wide awake when I lost my under 51.5. [NAME] can go fuck his ugly self
<|emo_disgust|> Because the other option is Labour And they are treacherous
<|emo_anger|> The west is so unfair :(
<|emo_anger|> Wasn’t there a video of the exact same dude kicking down a fucking tree????
<|emo_joy|> Here's my [NAME]. and [NAME] in front of our tree :)
<|emo_joy|> And then in a weird twist her family tries him for murder. Haha!
<|emo_sad|> Life is just an endless series of disappointments and no one gets out of here alive.
<|emo_fear|> Well that’s not what was said he said drugs that kill you sooner than your meant to die.. nicotine fits that description
<|emo_disgust|> Pure unadulterated hatred. It’s disgusting.
"<|emo_joy|> Your definition of a body is whats entertaining, laughable really !"
"<|emo_sad|> I wish. It's been over 72 hours for me now, nothing. Less than .5 ETH, BCH and BSV - hasn't moved."
<|emo_joy|> That is awesome to know. I’m moving back to Chicago in August.
<|emo_disgust|> Her comments are disgusting. Reminds me of my mother. I'm so sorry.
"<|emo_anger|> I love how some people have the mindset ""children should be seen not heard, unless they something rediculously outlandish then they must have a supernatural connection."""
"<|emo_joy|> I legit did this last night, I hit it and wave it around like crazy"
<|emo_disgust|> “Little dumb” ugh how awful
<|emo_joy|> Time to start my end of life tren blast!
<|emo_disgust|> “The weird thing is she’s got a tattoo of our company on her back...” lmfao
<|emo_fear|> Because the false accusation makes my anxiety worse
"<|emo_disgust|> Tbh I've never found the porn ads arousing, I've usually found them annoying, stupid, really clickbaity, or hilariously cheesy"
<|emo_fear|> I was suffering a delirium flu during the phantom facemask game so it’s all sorts of suffering for me.
<|emo_fear|> This has to be a joke. Your written word is atrocious.
<|emo_disgust|> Y'all are fucking annoying
<|emo_anger|> 80k/month? Damn. I need to become a Union Square store
"<|emo_disgust|> Illegal workers have no rights, no recourse to the law in the face of mistreatment. Abusive employers like that."
"<|emo_anger|> Fuck you, tincan. *reads username* Wait ignore the tin can part, fuck *specifically you* in general. "
"<|emo_surprise|> Not related, but now I wonder how Delta would have done on the hair ball challenge"
<|emo_joy|> Welp these were my happy tears of the days. :’)
<|emo_fear|> I was scared of my room and even when I fell asleep in my bed I would sleep walk into my mom's room
"<|emo_sad|> Drives to work, realizes its a holiday because nobody answers their phones. Still stuck at work... nothing to do. We dont get paid holidays :("
"<|emo_fear|> With some ultra cold coming, we could get some seriously great sundogs. Provided you don't die looking at it due to exposure..."
<|emo_sad|> I think I speak for most when I say: Please post the video
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] was just calling you out for being rude as fuck
"<|emo_anger|> That was a hell of a tip, that happens"
<|emo_disgust|> Talking about scary foreign people spreading disease is a classic xenophobic trope. Vile.
<|emo_joy|> This hit me a little too close to home
"<|emo_joy|> Take a note to PM me if you do, I'll happily pay for one!"
<|emo_sad|> This sounds so painful. I am so sorry. This ED is literally a demon.
<|emo_anger|> Then go fucking cry you weak minded piece of shit.
"<|emo_joy|> Yep, minimizing massively"
<|emo_surprise|> I like how he wrote many of the TRUE [NAME]. I wonder what a fake [NAME] believes in.
<|emo_sad|> Sorry for hopping on this. But anyone know of any bars in Hamburg to watch the match
<|emo_disgust|> This post should demonstrate that it already has become one of those subs. Disingenuousness is rampant here
<|emo_joy|> Cheers brother. That’s very interesting. First time I’ve seen that article.
"<|emo_disgust|> She's reading Canada's extradition act but not Canada's extradition treaty with the USA. I've had this argument before, it's pointless."
<|emo_anger|> It is so crazy to me that people unironcally use “kicks their trash”. I guess they just don’t want to swear.
<|emo_anger|> Drugs are a hell of a drug...
"<|emo_disgust|> I do not see how that is disgusting. She's cleaning her self and had a discharge, so what? "
<|emo_sad|> I high key thought this same thing then it was sad boy hours when I broke things up
<|emo_disgust|> I swear Denver has the worst sports media personalities.
<|emo_anger|> That son of a bitch!
"<|emo_disgust|> Takes all characteristics, good and bad "
"<|emo_joy|> Just hit my 3pl8 squat, been looking forward to this for a long time so really happy I finally got it! Now on to 4"
<|emo_joy|> Need turtle for the 3peat squad It’s crazy they were 1 team and now they are 5 :( I hope all of them can make playoffs
<|emo_disgust|> I don't think that's true. Every major story I remember from the [NAME] investigation has been from court documents.
"<|emo_fear|> Everything is cool when no one gets hurt.. But as soon as something bad happens, we all scream idiots... Why...?"
<|emo_joy|> I found some very interesting things on the mind shock podcasts about questions I had. Enjoy the digging in the reddit hole.
<|emo_disgust|> Stop gaslighting. It's gross.
"<|emo_disgust|> As someone who could totally eat three donuts in a row if I let myself, the amount of sugar this woman consumed still struck terror into my heart"
"<|emo_surprise|> With the weather we are having, it is a surprise when a battery works."
"<|emo_disgust|> Insofar as the Church has definitively ruled, it has been against evolution."
<|emo_sad|> Seriously. I had 2 jobs and was in college. I sleep more now!
<|emo_anger|> It's just nonsense. Any truly responsible gun owner respects life more than being tough.
"<|emo_anger|> Was already mad when it wasn’t center. Then when it got knock over, i was furious. Damn machine has no brains."
<|emo_anger|> Because our democracy is not going to be held hostage by terrorists
<|emo_sad|> Still is glitched to this day.... sad
<|emo_surprise|> are you fcking serious sis
<|emo_sad|> Just get divorced and be roommates.‍♀️
<|emo_joy|> I think everyone would enjoy it more if you did
"<|emo_anger|> If I hear ""not sorry, [NAME]"" one more time, I'm going to start disliking [NAME]"
<|emo_anger|> Shut up 15 year-old
<|emo_sad|> Sounds like a really bad time. Just wait till you have a nice time and place to trip.
"<|emo_joy|> Here, we [NAME] are open books. Brutal, and often hilarious truth in every word we speak 😂"
"<|emo_joy|> Yeah I reckon. I inspected the property too, just forgot to check/ask until after. I'll pass out of principal haha"
<|emo_anger|> This is on a video about electric guitars what the fuck?
<|emo_surprise|> Georgia is $5.25?! Wtf? We don’t live in 1990!
<|emo_disgust|> This game is actually worse than I was anticipating and I knew it was gonna be bad
<|emo_fear|> Oh heck oh frick
"<|emo_anger|> Yeah, fuck you for enjoying music! I'd love to see your collection. "
<|emo_surprise|> What a jackass
"<|emo_joy|> Yes! I play both, because I like the combat of one and everything else in the other."
<|emo_disgust|> Ugh. That was not information anyone needed...
<|emo_joy|> Sonic boom is funny as hell. I love the writing so much.
<|emo_joy|> Hello fellow Cincinnati area store
<|emo_surprise|> I actually found mine today! I will give it to my 1 year old
<|emo_sad|> i think [NAME] and [NAME] used to be married then he divorced her when he found she was cheating.
<|emo_disgust|> That was what was most nauseating for me honestly. Not a single period used once.
<|emo_disgust|> Because prostitutes clearly can't be raped or kidnapped. It's so horrifying that our society still believes this.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] yea!
<|emo_disgust|> Every hit should add more and more screenshake. What a tool.
"<|emo_disgust|> WHAT?! You dare insult the band of gods?! Typical teen, I hate my own generation! *screams in 16 year old*"
<|emo_disgust|> That was nasty... but also the most real thing I’ve seen on the show lately.. lol
<|emo_sad|> Primary is what she has to worry about.
<|emo_fear|> Whats more scary than a yellow man? A yellow man using yellow colour
<|emo_anger|> WHY THE FUCK IS BAYLESS ISOING
<|emo_joy|> This is my favorite [NAME] joke I've seen
<|emo_sad|> That scene made me think of Arizona a little bit tbh. I think I'm missing [NAME]*
<|emo_fear|> What is scary?
<|emo_joy|> This is my favorite game of all time. Thanks for bringing back some good memories!
<|emo_anger|> It's not the thumb it's the nail I hate gahhh I can feel it catching and tearing back aaaagh
<|emo_disgust|> People are disgusting and insane.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, my favorite artist and my favorite basketball player. This video is next level 🌊"
<|emo_anger|> Who even are you? Get off the Internet little boy. I don't have time for you
"<|emo_anger|> Well that sucks. But still if you refuses the test you'd probably have been charged, which is worse."
<|emo_fear|> 2005? I think we might be the same person lol. What a terrible year. I go back to that one a lot.
<|emo_sad|> The fact you have to explain this at the third grade level is pathetic. People think somone preventing his own murder is a tragedy.
"<|emo_joy|> Hi [NAME], I love you, that is all. Can't wait to see you in Worcester in February!"
<|emo_joy|> Let people enjoy things
<|emo_joy|> whah we got a badass over here xD
<|emo_anger|> This would be completely ludicrous. Turkey can literally just drive tanks over these guys if they want.
"<|emo_sad|> So, you literally grew up in a barn?"
<|emo_sad|> I used to love watching movie reviews and video essays. But it’s seems like I can’t enjoy anything anymore
"<|emo_anger|> Honestly, this has got to be the most reckless way to bully and harass a kid. Kids have a tendency to grow to their expectations"
"<|emo_sad|> Only if the fights are between chimpanzees. [NAME], those things will tear you to shreds"
<|emo_disgust|> Weird we’ve seen leftist harass and attack elder people and elder veterans but it doesn’t become mainstream news. I wonder why that is
<|emo_joy|> Yeah I tried it the best was just 100% scale.
"<|emo_sad|> as a guy who has the ability to repair circuit boards, oh god oh fuck this is beyond cursed"
<|emo_sad|> oh [NAME] this is horrible
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is a traitor to this country.
<|emo_surprise|> It's a photograph with one of our greatest ever defender and captain. What's your problem?
"<|emo_joy|> OHHHH, I like where Richmond is going with that."
"<|emo_joy|> Yup, cats can you think it could get the correct call. The US and holy shit how do you know there are too brittle."
<|emo_disgust|> Yes - sometimes I see amazingly detailed little faces. It's so weird.
<|emo_sad|> I am so sorry those kind of people make me sick
<|emo_joy|> You are my beer god thank you haha
<|emo_anger|> She wasn't a fit parent when she molested then 5 year-old [NAME] while she was high on meth. That ship has long sailed.
<|emo_sad|> It's a prime-time soap. I feel so guilty.
"<|emo_sad|> Calm down snowflake. Comment stalking from a week ago is really sad, especially when you're whining about something that I'm 100% right on. "
"<|emo_fear|> This incident happened a few years ago, before the angle. So it’s really establishing a pattern of horrible behavior. "
<|emo_surprise|> Can’t believe a club paid $550k for Sandow that’s absurd.
<|emo_fear|> Just thinking about all the stupid stuff I did as a kid makes me very afraid for my 5 year old.
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how big a problem this really is and what the cops' plan is.
<|emo_anger|> I had an ex like that. I know why I couldn't function with his way of life. Totally unproductive.
<|emo_anger|> UNCLE RADITZ IS PISSED!!!
"<|emo_surprise|> Exactly. I forget what the ""killed per year in a school shooting"" figure is but it's shockingly low."
"<|emo_anger|> Mental games. Take a (mental) shot everytime the teacher mispronounces a word,or messes up grammatically"
"<|emo_disgust|> April 2018– so this sub is now all about finding the outrage needles in the haystack, eh? "
<|emo_fear|> Stoop Kid’s afraid to leave his stoop!
<|emo_surprise|> Wow. You don't have any self control?
<|emo_anger|> Yeah wat a fucking knob right? Fucking nick...
<|emo_fear|> uuuuugh what keeps the penis spitting
<|emo_sad|> Still is glitched to this day.... sad
<|emo_anger|> No. It’s not. This is disgusting behavior and anyone who supports it is a fool.
<|emo_surprise|> How illuminating.
<|emo_sad|> i thought i was the only one who felt this way!
<|emo_surprise|> Shocking that a fat DnD kid is this self-important. Remarkable.
<|emo_anger|> But you'll downvote and complain but not provide any reasoning for your complaints? You sound like a child. Grow up.
<|emo_joy|> To each their own. I enjoy it for what it is
<|emo_joy|> That day was incredible.
<|emo_anger|> This! The [NAME] need to be kicked out!
<|emo_joy|> Yay! (Tech will be improved. Eeeek.)
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME], I love these kinds of threads."
"<|emo_anger|> lmao dana just like ""i fucking hate my nephew"""
<|emo_anger|> You are an asshole.
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad you're doing a bit better. Sorry about your grandma. Good luck.
"<|emo_joy|> Despite what you may feel about me, I’m happy you got that off your chest, I hope you feel better!"
<|emo_joy|> This one is my favorite.
<|emo_surprise|> HOLy SHIT I HAVE KADRI IN MY POOL
<|emo_sad|> It’s so sad that i can play all these Zelda games on my 3DS but not my Switch. I have like 12 Zelda games on my 3DS
<|emo_sad|> I'm sad I had to come this far down to find this.
<|emo_sad|> You sound upset.
<|emo_joy|> Happy Daily Peko #270! Source couldn’t be found I think it’s from the manga.
<|emo_disgust|> No the limiting factor is the leader raped a young boy and paid his silence
<|emo_fear|> Help me [NAME] I'm bully in high school for no reason.
<|emo_disgust|> The double standard. Taking pictures of women without their permission is taboo and creepy.
"<|emo_sad|> But something is extremely wrong if people are getting sick. Might not be a sonic wave, but it definitely is *something*"
<|emo_sad|> This almost certainly should not have gone to OT. SEC refs are bad CBB refs are bad
<|emo_fear|> Because in some cases parents are basically having their own children kidnapped and held against their will and forced into these programs. This is child abuse.
"<|emo_anger|> I would not be that mad though. Just disappointed. I am angry at people like you, not the show in itself."
<|emo_fear|> Oh gosh that's no good! Perhaps the other options are better places to start
<|emo_surprise|> Omg. It's Viv from [NAME] !
<|emo_fear|> That sounds awful. Do you like that schedule?
"<|emo_anger|> I just don’t like traversing through the snow, and how the salt stains some of my boots, and the mess it leaves at home."
<|emo_sad|> I’m so sorry to hear that! 😂😂😂
"<|emo_disgust|> Ugh yeah it’s really tiring. I’m in a public place right now and just had like, 3 mood swings. "
"<|emo_fear|> Well, since everything in Australia wants to kill you, I'd say it is quite healthy to be afraid of Australian spiders, and other flora and fauna "
"<|emo_sad|> She was sorry too, after I found out and ripped her a new one. LOL"
<|emo_anger|> And motherf'ing crack!
"<|emo_disgust|> Stay away from any of the Firkin pubs, they recycle the beer and fries! 🤢"
"<|emo_fear|> In case you're wondering, Nintendo does put a bittering agent in their Switch cartridges...and it tastes horrible. "
<|emo_surprise|> I still can't believe those guys got nominated.
<|emo_sad|> The saddest thing is you will never understand how absolutely idiotic what you just said is.
<|emo_anger|> Must be so frustrating having the wrong old man facing their own shutdowns.
<|emo_surprise|> There are so many posts from [NAME] on here it makes me wonder what people think wholesome means.
<|emo_joy|> Too much work to unsubscribe. And what happens when the timeskip ends and the new season starts?
"<|emo_joy|> When they touch my arm or shoulder while talking. Usually they do it with no sexual intent at all, but it still gives me butterflies. "
<|emo_fear|> I'm scared for her. The Saudi government has proven to be very brazen in its disrespect for international law.
"<|emo_anger|> woah ok metallica didnt do shit to metal. Think about Black Sabbath, MotorHead or judas preist but fuck man, metallica suck lol"
<|emo_fear|> In Canada you should probably be more worried about moose than bears
<|emo_anger|> Makes it even weirder that she now hates America
<|emo_fear|> > Crab Rave Ayyy I've never seen this before I kinda wanna go but seems scary.
<|emo_anger|> Where in that sentence did I mention US backed CIA coups? You're fucking shameless.
<|emo_joy|> I liked the comeback tho
<|emo_disgust|> Some graffiti can turn that really bad
"<|emo_joy|> That's a Russian pun, which is super easy. Also, inferior to [NAME] ""In Soviet Russia..."" jokes."
"<|emo_anger|> The fuck you call me!? A cunt!? Damn man, didn’t know I meant so much to you, right in the feels."
"<|emo_anger|> Fuck people that don't like pbr, only cheap bear I'll drink next to natty boh"
<|emo_disgust|> I remember the last protest we hid against these guys. Scum bags
<|emo_anger|> Damn liberals!
"<|emo_joy|> I think they were talking about the learning proccess. [NAME] succeded as well. So, 3 of them."
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] getting injured definitely didn’t help.Mou’s first Chelsea team was on a whole other level defensively
<|emo_disgust|> and how the fuck isn’t the man dead and there is a freaking rock 10 times bigger than him
"<|emo_surprise|> Ahh, I see. Well, he wasn't wrong!"
"<|emo_anger|> Oh man. Hardest lesson for me to learn as a new dm was that even with experienced players, combat with 7 PCs is brutally time consuming "
"<|emo_fear|> I can't imagine who IS, the whole thing is so cringe."
<|emo_surprise|> What a heel.
<|emo_joy|> I'm so happy for you !
<|emo_disgust|> What a weird and slightly creepy thing to come to mind as a reaction to this video. /s Edit: apparently indicating my sarcasm was necessary here.
<|emo_fear|> I know 😢 it’s one of my life’s goals to see a moose in real life despite how terrified I will be lol!!
<|emo_surprise|> I've shit my pants walking home from school. Hour long+ walk
<|emo_joy|> Cheers for that!
<|emo_joy|> Meow-meow smiles upon all of this.
<|emo_disgust|> It’s a shame really... ruining a perfectly good shirt like that
<|emo_sad|> this video made me feel like screaming
<|emo_surprise|> *gasp!*
<|emo_anger|> I don't know what she is talking about. Therefore i will say that she is DEFINITELY WRONG AND SHOULD SHUT UP! /s
<|emo_anger|> fuck off. let people enjoy what they want to enjoy when it doesn't impact you.
"<|emo_joy|> This was funny the first time, now this jokes been beaten to death so badly."
"<|emo_joy|> Boy I *sure hope* this isn't a weekly thread, how obnoxious, haha"
<|emo_anger|> See i hate [NAME] and got my ass kicked that game bc i couldnt use him so i was lime why me 😂
"<|emo_sad|> [NAME] why do they keep adding words to facist. Neofascist, cryptofascist, snowfascist. It's so dumb."
<|emo_fear|> If you think it's a real emergency don't waste too much time and try to call the police
"<|emo_disgust|> I’m new here... do people like this actually sell their art for these prices? It only takes one sucker, but are there such suckers?"
<|emo_sad|> She reminds me of my crazy sister. Just a ball of nervousness and constantly just on the verge of crying.
<|emo_joy|> She’s sexy I’d hit.
"<|emo_anger|> Pinkwashing a violent, repressive institution isn’t cool. "
<|emo_joy|> Or at least a couple more visits to the booth. I enjoyed hearing him adding to the banter.
<|emo_anger|> It’s a self fulfilling prophesy. They know things are getting more violent because they are looking to make them that way.
<|emo_anger|> You are so ugly even tears wont show up near you
<|emo_joy|> He’s our puppy. He likes to show us stuff he finds around the house. This time he found money bag. We forgave him
"<|emo_anger|> She wasn't fucking running, no matter how hard you insist. You'd make a wonderful Qld cop with that mentality."
<|emo_fear|> Yikes. That sounds terrible 😢
<|emo_joy|> Yes I would love to see!
"<|emo_surprise|> Dang, dawg. That one shocked me "
<|emo_disgust|> She sounds hideous.
<|emo_disgust|> I suppose. It was just weird how they went on a NASCAR tangent for like 3 minutes lol.
<|emo_sad|> yeh and the new ones just feel like reskin cod games sadly
<|emo_sad|> Unfortunate that her knee never rose to the occasion
<|emo_sad|> Orange fan sad. :(
<|emo_surprise|> Weird how they shoehorned s character from an ongoing tv show into Celebrity Big Brothter. Glad they got rid of him after one episode though.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, y'all are heroes! "
"<|emo_surprise|> Two different writers have two differing opinions??? I'm shocked, just absolutely shocked, I tell you!"
<|emo_sad|> Sadly it happens randomly and I wouldn't want to lie to someone for money if the thoughts didn't appear.
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry, I mean that closing the carried interest loophole would raise $18 billion over ten years according to the NY Times. I mistyped."
"<|emo_fear|> I don't wish abortions on any woman. It's a terrible thing to endure. Necessary, sure, but it's still grim."
"<|emo_anger|> What a fucking moronic jackass. ""This is what happened with my piece of shit dad so you have to experience it too"""
<|emo_joy|> Thank you for that ! I’m glad it’s just not me !
"<|emo_surprise|> It would be a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one."
<|emo_joy|> “Enjoy your dinner”
<|emo_joy|> Lovely. If you have no success in finding a copy I'd be more than happy to post it to you.
<|emo_joy|> Chuckle worthy. It's funny. There's at least structure to set up the punchline.
<|emo_disgust|> Lots of people suck on the show but [NAME] is the only one who sucks in real life.
<|emo_disgust|> You dirty scavenger
<|emo_sad|> I feel like I got lured into a fever dream by a normal combo video's beginning
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME] is so cute ^_^, the second bunny image is my favourite. Since you haven't got any requests... I request Himiko."
<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Yeah does your place autograt at 8 or more ? So sorry 😐
<|emo_surprise|> You president now?
<|emo_sad|> I hope you or someone close to you never has to go through what this woman is going through.
<|emo_disgust|> You sound jealous as fuck. Work hard and you too can drive a nice car.
"<|emo_anger|> I don't care, [NAME] tweets make me uncomfortable and I hate him!!! - Liberals"
"<|emo_joy|> Hey, I bought a few issues of ""Lady Death"" and it was awesome! I wasn't hanging posters though."
<|emo_sad|> That was painful to read.
<|emo_disgust|> i think the telekinesis could make a great card. sth like: move an enemy card to another position and stun its new neighbors for this round.
<|emo_sad|> That ESPN intro made me emotional 😭
<|emo_anger|> How aren’t you in fucking school
"<|emo_sad|> That is so sad, just goes to show we have a lot more to learn about the other beings we share this rock with : /"
<|emo_anger|> it's funny how conservatives always say that leftists get angry over everything when conservatives get angry over a starbucks cup or a brown man existing
"<|emo_anger|> Is this supposed to be funny? Psst, if you guys knew the reality behind this joke..."
<|emo_joy|> Such a great moment. I love sports because you can always remember where exactly you were when great moments like this happened.
"<|emo_sad|> That's really sad to hear, I can't imagine. I'm wishing the best for you"
<|emo_joy|> That's exactly what I would expect [NAME] parents to look like lol
<|emo_joy|> I’m a millennial and my mortgage payment only takes about 1/5 of my after tax earnings in a month. Feels so good.
"<|emo_disgust|> Stay away from any of the Firkin pubs, they recycle the beer and fries! 🤢"
<|emo_joy|> Breaking news- Man having fun at party is mocked by basement dwelling redditor.
<|emo_anger|> Never go to the post office. that place is hell. pay commercial plus online and order every material you need.
<|emo_surprise|> This story made my day. Ha!
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I have to say, I am relieved. Pretty incredible idea."
"<|emo_fear|> Wait, did this really happen? I'd like to see that video so I can cringe some more plz."
<|emo_joy|> Just what I need; a video of my commute to work so I can enjoy the experience in my free time.
"<|emo_disgust|> Tyl has got to be the most cringey, condescending thing I've seen on Reddit in a while."
<|emo_fear|> I'm also scared.
<|emo_surprise|> > and [NAME] mentions that he's cold to the touch. you mean after he almost froze to dealth?
<|emo_disgust|> Disgusting making [NAME] talk to this fat moron
<|emo_sad|> Sorry for your loss. Thoughts and prayers.
<|emo_sad|> If that’s true it’s very desperate. You would think he had some better way of communicating.
<|emo_surprise|> You guys really hate the Seahawks more than the Cowboys? Maybe I'm just old.
<|emo_anger|> Yes you should tell them and report him to the police for dating someone underage and giving her cigarettes.
<|emo_anger|> Oh my bad I starting typing before you posted it
<|emo_anger|> That's ignorant as all hell. Tell them to buy their own.

<|emo_joy|> Ayee it made it ! Enjoy
<|emo_disgust|> They’re disgusting people inside and out
<|emo_fear|> Incontinence is a terrible thing
"<|emo_sad|> Maybe but kids and social media and cellphones in classroom, and a pervasive culture that glorifies sports over education are ruining our education system. "
<|emo_anger|> You have no perspective. Go outside and get some friends.
<|emo_fear|> That's the kind of person who'd fuck up making you a plain hamburger. That sack o' shit needs to be sent through a wood chipper.
<|emo_surprise|> Wondering why this hasn’t been made a thing yet 😂
<|emo_disgust|> This offense is just painful to watch.
<|emo_anger|> What the FRICK
<|emo_fear|> It’s been over 20 years since I rode the 15. I’m still traumatized.
<|emo_fear|> Why did she get married if she did not love him? Aren't you afraid the same thing wil happen to you?

<|emo_anger|> *slams obvious repost on the desk* Pack your things. Get outta my subreddit
<|emo_fear|> Violence only begets violence. We'll wind up with an authoritarian despot as ruler if there's a violent revolution.
<|emo_sad|> I hope you or someone close to you never has to go through what this woman is going through.
<|emo_anger|> Wow this was awful. What kind of audience do these morons have? I mean no one with the money to buy that junk would watch these fools

<|emo_anger|> Sucks to suck
<|emo_disgust|> The main reason I left is a hidden mmr used to influence matchmaking in a mode that requires a paid entry. That's disgusting

<|emo_joy|> So happy I bought a PC. If you’re looking for a better experience across ALL games I suggest you do the same.
"<|emo_joy|> I made this a 41 from a 42, so satisfying!"
<|emo_disgust|> 8 His morality is depraved. 9 His brutality is indulgent. 10 His religion is repudiated. 11 His existence is nullified. 12 His believers are mistaken.
<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised [NAME] let her post that.
"<|emo_anger|> These stupid fucking cunts don’t even use “shade” correctly, [NAME] would toss them off the pier."
<|emo_surprise|> wow...u wanna say u were never toxic and u never rage okay if u can t do what I asked just go away ok???
<|emo_joy|> No problem. I'm happy to know it's not what you meant.
<|emo_sad|> Sad. My condolences to her family.
<|emo_joy|> 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂you win the internet today 😅😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😂😂
"<|emo_anger|> This is objectively wrong, what the actual fuck lol."
"<|emo_anger|> Sometimes that would work. Sometimes it wouldn't. Regardless, the OP asked what he could do, not who was at fault."
<|emo_fear|> That movie really scared me when I was a kid.
<|emo_surprise|> Damn I can’t believe [NAME] beat up [NAME]
"<|emo_disgust|> Just got back,amd I realized that The Ducks are getting clutterfuckedd"
<|emo_sad|> Thanks. I want to travel the world but have no reasonable way of affording it.
<|emo_joy|> You have no idea how incredible they make me feel in every single way. It's not something I'm used to!!
<|emo_fear|> This is terrible
"<|emo_disgust|> Bannner and flask are both viable for both sides, just mess around and get a feel for them."
<|emo_sad|> That last sentence pains me
<|emo_surprise|> Considering the mass amount of seasonals they hired this year I wouldn’t be surprised.
<|emo_anger|> Somebody gettin fired
"<|emo_disgust|> Understand their point of view, 13 IS too young. Imagine how they felt when they found out their innocent child was watching adult videos."
<|emo_anger|> CBA's app is atrocious. I had to set it up on my mother's new iPhone and it was a nightmare.
<|emo_fear|> It's pretty dangerous when the state decides which fictional deity is legitimate. For example the [NAME].....
<|emo_surprise|> I remember when I started showering every day as a kid. Everyone's first thought was I had a girlfriend.
<|emo_joy|> Glad we cleared this up
"<|emo_disgust|> >He was deeply and utterly insecure, and it was pathetic. He still is. And it still is."
<|emo_joy|> Yeah cheers. Hoping it's gonna be better. Happy early new year to you too.
<|emo_joy|> Wow thanks. Didn’t know there were any others glad to hear
<|emo_joy|> But it seems like im only meeting pros but im silver 6
<|emo_joy|> Hahah you right. Please don't tell any birds!
"<|emo_joy|> I'm just glad they'll chill out in the main sub, they were swarmin."
"<|emo_disgust|> Just the fact that people constantly use words like ""incel"" to demean people proves that society is getting worse than it already is."
<|emo_joy|> My son and I both enjoy taking pictures. It gives us pleasure. Part of the fun for us on vacation is taking pictures of new things.
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh... I read that the fedora made her sweaty... I can't imagine head wear making someone moist. But hey, there's something for everyone."
<|emo_disgust|> Opiates make me puke and so do babies. Where the science there? Babies are just nasty
"<|emo_disgust|> MOTHERFUCKING FLYING MONKEYS, AHHHHHHHHGHGHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!"
<|emo_sad|> I am sad to hear about your cat. Pets become like a family member. I am glad to hear you are doing better.
<|emo_disgust|> And KAT with 6. Weird game.
<|emo_anger|> She's blindfolded too! It's like they're trying to write a shitty remake of Blackadder with these cunning plans.
"<|emo_fear|>  goat handshake denied Personally, I just think [NAME] was scared of touching such a relic as is [NAME] hand"
<|emo_joy|> You described my life!!
<|emo_disgust|> I suppose. It was just weird how they went on a NASCAR tangent for like 3 minutes lol.
<|emo_sad|> I almost feel bad for China.... but the culture has a major problem with having 0 morals.
<|emo_anger|> She's a pro-Assad piece of shit.
<|emo_surprise|> This is the whitest thing I’ve ever seen in my life
<|emo_fear|> Well you needn't worry about it I won't be coming back to that floating turd you call a country
<|emo_anger|> Huhhhh wat the hell.. looks good
"<|emo_joy|> Cheers mate for the correction, i saw Prestigeiskey's vid and couldnt remember exactly when but knew its coming sooner than later. "
"<|emo_joy|> Eh, Level 7 is pretty serious. Give me my Massif and I'll survive anything."
<|emo_sad|> so painful to watch ugh im excited for trade szn
<|emo_sad|> Omg this.. completely relatable and depressing.. yay for us.
<|emo_fear|> No it’s ok. How does [NAME] feel about his mom hovering? Are there plans to move out or is this a permanent thing?
<|emo_joy|> Don’t forget sports gambling. THEN we’ll be happy.
<|emo_joy|> They get a bottle or i get a bottle...may as well share the wealth
"<|emo_anger|> And maybe one day you'll be able to afford one, but until then continue being an edgy teenager whining about the war on drugs. "
<|emo_joy|> It could be how depression is effecting you but i don't think it's crazy
<|emo_disgust|> Communism advocates a stateless society. They just got kicked in the head into believing Private Property is bad.
<|emo_anger|> fuck I meant to put a never in there. I'm glad you picked me up on this before I got put on a subreddit.
"<|emo_disgust|> I’d tell her nothing, that freaking weirdo would just never see my kid. The End. Disgusting."
"<|emo_fear|> Those are horrible things to say to a child, let alone a 3 yr old. I would be pissed!"
<|emo_joy|> Hahaha. Oh [NAME]. Way to ruin the fun lol
<|emo_disgust|> I'd say the guy who was going beat [NAME] face in is the worst character on the show.
<|emo_disgust|> Weird flex.
"<|emo_joy|> Unless you're trying it with dollarstore shit, don't risk wasting the money. Just enjoy it."
<|emo_anger|> He's manipulating you by using his mental illness as an excuse for his behavior. He knows what he's doing too.
<|emo_joy|> Beautiful!!! I always accidentally miss the 45 S exit at this location.
<|emo_joy|> I'm not sure I would be happy to live in hk for 5 years lmbo
<|emo_surprise|> Wow thank you so much for the info. I tried looking it up but couldn't find anything. Very interesting stuff
<|emo_sad|> I killed them for the first time in my most recent playthrough and regretted it. The replacement council sucks just as hard.
<|emo_disgust|> But really Vanilla Ice is scum RIP [NAME] and [NAME]
"<|emo_surprise|> That sounds terrible, man. Have you been to a doctor yet?"
<|emo_anger|> The thing to understand about [NAME] is that he's a complete moron.
"<|emo_sad|> I think that's just natural, humans weren't really intended to fly by nature so I guess it just feels wrong or something, idk"
<|emo_sad|> Almost totally gone... Let's see if we can guilt this loser into rescinding the medal
<|emo_sad|> Kinda sad to laugh at people who really need serious help.
<|emo_surprise|> On [NAME] I’m in Alabama [NAME] pay what you pay and get 179Mbps down smh
<|emo_sad|> I. AM. AWARE. That doesn't make it cool and good for him to race bait.
"<|emo_anger|> Good. The US is behaving shamefully, the least Canada can do is to try and pick up a little of the slack. "
"<|emo_joy|> YAAAS! Even though you're a stranger on the internet, this has made my day."
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME].
<|emo_sad|> I never understood the real harm until I started reading about childhood emotional neglect and how much it affected me. It's very common with nParents.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow fuk I'm watching that right now
"<|emo_sad|> Unfortunate for him, but I'm bringing up players. >AND they can just stop being a support."
"<|emo_anger|> Not surprised, damn that sucks. Concussions are awful."
<|emo_sad|> I just got a shirt made that says “I can’t have kids my dog is allergic”
<|emo_surprise|> It’s [NAME]?!
<|emo_fear|> Yeah it’s not like I want my cat to lick me in a sexual way that’s just weird.
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how big a problem this really is and what the cops' plan is.
<|emo_disgust|> This is horribly disgusting. It's worse than the god damn chicken wire.
<|emo_sad|> That’s a lot of damage
"<|emo_fear|> You're getting your french fries from the wrong places, then."
<|emo_disgust|> They definitely didn't do [NAME] mode justice with Carrier Assault. Lots of small differences that added up to feel completely at odds with the original.
<|emo_surprise|> What an incel
<|emo_anger|> What an idiot.
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder why they're single?
<|emo_joy|> Aww thanks :)
"<|emo_disgust|> If the kid knew what she had on her mind, he's been corrupted way too young.."
"<|emo_joy|> Forgot he had been sent down and was really confused, but happy about this post."
<|emo_joy|> That's so frustrating but I'm glad you're all safe.
<|emo_anger|> What does all that pill shit they talk about mean anyways? Like what the fuck is a black pill and a red pill?
"<|emo_joy|> Thanks for laugh, I needed that. "
<|emo_anger|> What an immature response. With a little passive agressive racism to boot. Classy.
<|emo_joy|> The fix is in.. to convenient.
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how big a problem this really is and what the cops' plan is.
<|emo_anger|> You're an idiot and no one believes you and your telegram jerk-off buddies.
<|emo_fear|> You sound scared
"<|emo_joy|> I'm so happy for you and so, so, so proud of you. It's HARD to talk to your doctor about this stuff."
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] is scary
<|emo_anger|> Of course. Just know that I know that you know you're a liar.
"<|emo_joy|> I remember 2008-2010. Phones couldn't do that yet. Phones had 640x480 screens back then, and believe me, we were amazed by that."
<|emo_disgust|> that this ridiculous comparison is this detailed and explicit makes me think the whole beating-a-little-girl-thing is part of his disgusting sexual fantasies.
"<|emo_anger|> You know what they say, when everyone around you is and asshole, maybe it's you who is the asshole."
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a creeper and hangs out with underage girls n shit.
"<|emo_anger|> that sucks, good luck next time!"
<|emo_sad|> Stranger than fiction. Can't even begin to comprehend what that poor [NAME] was going through.
<|emo_sad|> Sad if step kids are nice children I am sorry they are in this dynamic
<|emo_anger|> I was just scrolling down and I screamed when I got to the feet
"<|emo_joy|> Holy heck I'm so happy for you! That shit is an expense no one needs to worry about, and nor you don't! :D"
"<|emo_joy|> This is the kind of relationship i want to have,a warm soothing one.... "
<|emo_joy|> I've finally found my people who know the struggle.
<|emo_anger|> Oh we’re TANKING tanking
<|emo_fear|> Yeah but scary brown people. Ever thought of that libtard? /s ^just ^^in ^^^case
<|emo_sad|> the older i get the more it hurts
<|emo_anger|> I will call the police if you dont stop harassing me
<|emo_disgust|> Weirdly enough that's my favorite part of his videos: the ending sting/title card It reminds me of old school racing and fighting games with those over-the-top announcers
<|emo_surprise|> Suddenly went 6 to midnight TBH
<|emo_surprise|> omgad that monster!
"<|emo_fear|> I don't wish abortions on any woman. It's a terrible thing to endure. Necessary, sure, but it's still grim."
<|emo_anger|> Any chance we could treat the terrorists as terrorists then?
<|emo_anger|> “I’ll never have a playoff mandate” go fuck yourself [NAME]
"<|emo_anger|> It was SO hard to click the upvote button on this one. It's one of those ""I hate it. Well done"" moments."
<|emo_sad|> This hurts me more than the fan meme.
"<|emo_fear|> Don't worry, [NAME]. Her idea of wit is nothing more than an incisive observation humorously phrased and delivered with impeccable timing."
<|emo_joy|> :) I like this.
"<|emo_anger|> FUCK OFF THAT""S A PEN"
<|emo_joy|> Hey everybody we got us an optimist here.
<|emo_disgust|> And I though Glory Kills were gruesome
<|emo_disgust|> I threw my only book away so I could go catch Pokemon creatures
"<|emo_joy|> My boss makes 100 but I only make 10, shat four times today so the joke’s on them."
"<|emo_surprise|> As a personal agent of entropy in this world: Damn, what laptop do you use?"
<|emo_surprise|> Shocking that a fat DnD kid is this self-important. Remarkable.
<|emo_sad|> . . .k but it's unlikely since unless you're a liberal and a woman thinking emotionally often shouldn't be a thing.
<|emo_anger|> Damn. Is that what those shorts are supposed to look like on people!? 😂
<|emo_anger|> Sounds hella aggressive. You can say the same thing while being nicer about it.
<|emo_fear|> Just the name of it gives me anxiety
<|emo_anger|> Goddamn it...
"<|emo_surprise|> Whoa, wasn't expecting a rational take on this here on reddit. Well done."
<|emo_disgust|> If he doesn’t give it a ten I’m gonna riot
<|emo_joy|> I'm so glad Mercy's have to actually try now.
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] dead and it was the Government that killed him.
<|emo_anger|> Exactly! How dare we give those people shade!
"<|emo_surprise|> Surprised to not see Three Arrows on the list when he went from no videos at all to over 100,000 subscribers just in the course of 2018."
<|emo_anger|> Dude nsfw this damn
<|emo_anger|> I think you and I think alike. Sometimes I wish I knew less of history... because ignorance can be blissful
<|emo_surprise|> Wow! Never thought of it this way but that's a REALLY good point.
"<|emo_joy|> As someone named [NAME], I welcome him to Dallas Gang"
<|emo_joy|> I actually enjoy doing this on my own. Am I weird?
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] responded in the most honest and best way possible, even with the sassy ""Pfffft"" sound before telling her to fuck off lol "
<|emo_sad|> Sorry but the majority of console players will agree that he needs nerfed and nerfed hard
<|emo_surprise|> I’m shocked at how big that defeat is.
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I'm glad he got caught. What a piece of crap.well at least he won't be a virgin in jail anymore haha
"<|emo_disgust|> Nah, [NAME] literally shit his pants in the playoffs. He had to go to the washroom to decompress during a fucking playoff game lmao"
<|emo_anger|> Whataboutism then. Some of the worst I've seen at that too.
"<|emo_sad|> Sadly no, everything was thrown around the room, and everytime I rebuilt something, it would be annihilated again."
<|emo_sad|> Same here. It’s very hard. I really feel for you.
"<|emo_surprise|> If reincarnation is real, I hope next time I have a name that's half as awesome as [NAME]."
<|emo_surprise|> Yeah keep filming your kid kicking a dog in the face. I'm suprised this isn't on r/funny
<|emo_disgust|> People still expecting that are delusional regardless tbh. Messed up they'll never say what happened to Half Life but time to start using some context clues herr
<|emo_joy|> Macs Local Eats is just the best. I don't know what else to say.
<|emo_surprise|> What a block by [NAME]
<|emo_anger|> YOU DON'T GET TO JUDGE ME!
"<|emo_fear|> Any one of us could be a journalist, and that level of journalism feeding the masses is mildly scary."
"<|emo_sad|> Too bad he went back home to Nepal, it's always great seeing these young spinners getting a go in the BBL."
<|emo_joy|> Nicknames like that get me all hot and bothered.
"<|emo_disgust|> Also, they ruined Top Gear but that’s a whole other issue."
<|emo_joy|> I love you guys. Beers on me
"<|emo_joy|> You know what I love abou you [NAME]? Octopussy. Man, I must have seen that movie... twice."
<|emo_anger|> You cant.Its the idiot civilian drivers fault for probably just staying behind him like a zombie. Unless they come out with heated trailers soon.
<|emo_sad|> Wow. Racists are really coming out of the woodwork to excuse and defend racism. How sad.
<|emo_joy|> It really is! I loved everything about it. I'm so happy my friend told me about the franchise :)
<|emo_surprise|> what guy or girl would be glad to get this as a gift
"<|emo_disgust|> Welcome to racial integration, where your civility standards are racist and you better shut up or else."
"<|emo_anger|> Well damn, sounds more reliable then shit like and all that"
<|emo_surprise|> I just can't believe she had the nerve to call both [NAME] and [NAME] low ability
<|emo_joy|> im glad they have it but this should have really been introduced in DMC3
<|emo_anger|> Happy Cake Day you barefoot bitch!
<|emo_fear|> Because it was a terrible idea.
"<|emo_anger|> MOTHERFUCKING FLYING MONKEYS, AHHHHHHHHGHGHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"<|emo_surprise|> Dude, an older woman will eat you for lunch and wonder who's handing her the toothpick and handling the entree order."
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry i was thinking of the word ""Plaintiff"""
<|emo_sad|> Unfortunately if you’re looking for game info about the Detroit Basketball team your in the wrong sub.
<|emo_anger|> Yes. You fucking troll me every time. Fuck you.
<|emo_sad|> i want the little polly pocket heart purse so bad but i ain't paying hot topic $40 for it
<|emo_surprise|> I’m surprised they arnt argonians
<|emo_disgust|> Sucks to suck
"<|emo_disgust|> I loathe him too, but I couldn't even get on board with lynching him. Not even that obnoxious twat [NAME]"
<|emo_sad|> I’m sorry but [NAME] has better memes
"<|emo_fear|> [NAME] “ I’m afraid if I don’t have money she’ll leave me”. Yuh, you’re exactly right [NAME]."
"<|emo_sad|> Damn, this hits close to home. Reddit is literally the only place where i can talk about personal stuff without being judged"
"<|emo_sad|> i’m running, hiding & avoiding this man. poor girl. her story is a sad one "
"<|emo_anger|> Ahh damn! Gotta pay attention to that, never even knew!"
<|emo_anger|> IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT MAMA
<|emo_joy|> Dude I love working OC. You can bounce around like 4 different districts
<|emo_joy|> Reminds me of the old lady in Police Academy 4 shooting the .44 magnum. Damn that was fun!
<|emo_surprise|> ...soooooo yes?
"<|emo_joy|> She’s just not that into you, that’s what I think. You need to find an HL girlfriend and go have fun. "
<|emo_sad|> It bothers me that he doesn’t respond to your texts. That’s weird
"<|emo_joy|> My friend and I have been having good fun queuing Mei/Winston, trololo, and 2 bottles of whisky."
<|emo_sad|> Out of all the seasons I definitely feel the worst for her
<|emo_sad|> I feel the exact same way. It makes me so insecure
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] and [NAME] for [NAME] then sign [NAME] afraid this battle station is fully operational
<|emo_sad|> A little girl recently died because her parents refused to get her medical treatment and insisted [NAME] would heal her.
<|emo_joy|> I love those possum dives!
<|emo_disgust|> that's like a kel'thuzad/kael'thas wet dream right there. Line them up for disgusting aoe XD
<|emo_anger|> I post on the the Donald you think I give a fat flying fuck?
<|emo_anger|> Let's say he quits or is fired (we already know neither will happen). Who the [NAME] would we pick to replace him?
"<|emo_joy|> Very tired us can attendant: ""here are your vagina slimes."" ... thankfully the customer just laughed kt off."
<|emo_anger|> wait... so are ugly people downwoted all the time or they don't post or what is going on here...
"<|emo_surprise|> Youd be surprised how many times the ""hebephilia is not pedophilia"" argument comes up on reddit. "
<|emo_joy|> Ate too much “hot chips”
<|emo_joy|> Someone get fat boy [NAME] a happy meal.
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how [NAME] prepares his food.
"<|emo_joy|> Yeah, the big thing I'm glad is he hasn't ballooned up. "
<|emo_joy|> This is the kinda stuff that is cute in romantic comedies. It just depends on how much you like him.
<|emo_joy|> Woah... I'm shortsighted and I can get 2 pairs of glasses for €149. $500 is insane!
<|emo_disgust|> he had the shits
<|emo_fear|> I remembered it slightly differently. My brain is terrible for coming up with this one: [NAME] Long Thick Penis Has Come To Town.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh really? I didn’t know someone else posted it haha Edit: just looked and someone posted it right after me
<|emo_anger|> No. Screw him. It IS a demanding job. Physically and emotionally draining. You deserve a hot meal and a friggin hour or two to decompress.
<|emo_anger|> It's beyond evil. It is pure demonic when it's that pure sadism and vile sick torture. I hate them guys.
<|emo_disgust|> That and he’s sneaky dirty
"<|emo_surprise|> Also his Whirlpool seems to be bugged, sometime it stays for like 3more seconds even tho you don't get any damage from it anymore"
<|emo_joy|> Why did we have [NAME] that one year shoot against Draymond. I dunno because its entertainment and story lines.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow...Mean [NAME] passed away today. RIP
<|emo_sad|> Just reading this makes me sick
<|emo_joy|> Glad I’m on my way out through ATL instead!
"<|emo_joy|> Match highlights for those interested, it was a very fun match"
"<|emo_fear|> Is this a dogmatic fear of capital controls, regardless of scope and implantation?"
<|emo_fear|> This is so scary but I would love to go there. And it is actually in Brazil
<|emo_joy|> ahhhhh no how dare i have morals of course the most important thing is that my favorite football team has a better special teams coordinator
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] I forgot about that movie
"<|emo_anger|> People are gonna end up hating Deus Ex because of this, and that's just a travesty"
<|emo_joy|> That lady is experiencing pure joy
"<|emo_sad|> >Found out that **my** [NAME] Oh, I get it. You've caught the scent of a lesser stag in your nostrils. Pity!"
<|emo_joy|> Now the 'fun' really starts. :(
<|emo_anger|> Oh my lord I am so sorry. That is just despicable. Internet hugs.
"<|emo_disgust|> Examples of useless government entities, little buddy."
<|emo_surprise|> Omg!! They are kinda turning [NAME] into new [NAME].
<|emo_sad|> Poor and lonely.
"<|emo_anger|> I would make a terrible partner. Fuck, I'm not even a good friend. "
<|emo_anger|> Horrible waste of time.
<|emo_disgust|> God [NAME] is awful
<|emo_sad|> Sadly this is how you get shit fixed
<|emo_joy|> Dental Assisting. I still deal with people but going through school and doing hours at a dental office I'm thoroughly enjoying it.
<|emo_disgust|> Ugh. I wish you were wrong.
<|emo_fear|> Wow .. this is more terrifying than if they were a ghost ! Amazing twist
<|emo_sad|> I DONT LIKE EM PUTTIN CHEMICALS IN THE WATER TO TURN THE FRIGGIN FROGS GAY **UNH UNH UNH**
<|emo_sad|> I’m sorry to inform you that this man is an imposter. I’m actually undercover atm.
<|emo_surprise|> I just really don't see 20% for him. I would be very surprised.
<|emo_joy|> I bought the double barrel and fully upgraded it and now it's one of my favorite guns.
<|emo_disgust|> Yikes. She sounds like she's one bad grade away from shooting up a synagogue.
<|emo_fear|> So edgy.
<|emo_fear|> Survival of the toughest.
<|emo_sad|> Pretty blunt/rude on his part. Maybe he felt bad for you and wanted to be your friend though.
"<|emo_surprise|> Good lord. > STATISTICS ARE BAD, WE MUST RELY ON ANECDOTES!"
"<|emo_anger|> You know, that never occurred to me! So keep cool in summer, warm in winter?"
<|emo_fear|> Was almost hit by some idiot yesterday that drove straight through a red light and into a crossing.
"<|emo_disgust|> *Shrug* ""Heh, Another tuesday"""
<|emo_sad|> I miss those days.
"<|emo_fear|> Let [NAME] think about his performance for this 2 week break, god that was a brutal last 5 mins "
<|emo_anger|> Now I hate the giants as much as the next but they're 4th in average attendance and percentage.
"<|emo_disgust|> Disgusting. This is blatant nepotism, and that man should be ashamed."
"<|emo_joy|> in the words of [NAME]: As big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it. Had to give you a career to destroy it "
"<|emo_fear|> I told you, he’s not a menace!"
<|emo_fear|> That’s scary
"<|emo_sad|> I used to have no problems finding them, but I’m struggling really hard now"
<|emo_disgust|> Indeed it does. I blame [NAME] and his love of sponsorships.
<|emo_anger|> She’s cool as hell
<|emo_joy|> Made my day
<|emo_sad|> My entire body aches now
<|emo_surprise|> OMG what??? ...[NAME] actually showed up for a gig without cancelling with a terrible excuse?
<|emo_anger|> Glad *you* find it funny!! You've ruined my morning!!
<|emo_anger|> Dudes never show any interest in me irl so I was just thinking about getting a Tinder. Seems like people have much lower standards on there so fuck it
"<|emo_joy|> Someone made this album, dwights a bit lanky but I enjoyed it. "
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow that was a roasting... Deserved, but daaaaamn [NAME]"
<|emo_sad|> Why is this not 5x5? It hurts my eyes...
<|emo_surprise|> Oh damn it! I was just on my way to the post box
<|emo_anger|> Maybe it's similar to how [NAME] hates cantaloupe.
<|emo_sad|> I'll second this notion. One of the first things to go is texting when I start getting sad.
"<|emo_anger|> me: haha im an incel. rApE sHoUlD bE lEgAl! wOmEn ArE iNcApAbLe Of ThInKiNg greaseball who stares at my chest on the bus: Well, actually..."
<|emo_sad|> Hard. Social anxiety/general fear/uggoness kept me from actually getting dates and i was extremely awkward when I finally stopped anxie-puking to actually go on the date.
<|emo_sad|> Sad but true.
"<|emo_joy|> Watching girly tv shows. Stuff like gossip girl, pretty little liars, and gilmore girls are all a guilty pleasure"
<|emo_joy|> Found my flair.
<|emo_fear|> I feel terrible for their daughter. I wouldnt want to grow up in between the middle of that.
<|emo_joy|> Finally some appreciation
"<|emo_joy|> This needs to be a series. Start a series. For the love all that's holy on reddit, please...make a series."
<|emo_fear|> I don't know any but my own I'm afraid.
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] I’m so sorry sweety
"<|emo_fear|> >Some ~~drugs~~ people are just... Scary... Some drugs tend to bring out what's bubbling under the surface, so in that way, yeah. "
<|emo_joy|> I’d gladly
<|emo_surprise|> Won't stop the BF from going to jail.
<|emo_anger|> Ah yes three of my ~~best friends~~ worst enemies
<|emo_disgust|> I had a second date yesterday with such bad breath! I gave him a pass on the first date because we met online.
"<|emo_disgust|> Troo, troo....worse eban dan eat pizza wif aht a ferk. "
<|emo_anger|> Shame on you
<|emo_anger|> If men were that aggressive we’d be arrested and then slammed publicly and socially. Lives ruined for a moment of drunken stupor.
<|emo_surprise|> oh! I have more ships this time! Niice!
<|emo_fear|> She was behind sesta/fosta just recently. Which has done more to censor thr internet than the net neutrality that everyone freaks out on. This is terrible news.
<|emo_joy|> Oh wow this is big. Thanks for the heads up. Indeed! So many great memories that I still like to reflect back on. Thanks!
"<|emo_joy|> You look the same to me, but I'm happy you had a goal and accomplished it!! You're a cutie !! "
<|emo_joy|> Horray for Persona
"<|emo_surprise|> Man, I can’t believe we traded all that and didn’t even get a top 10 guy"
"<|emo_joy|> ive had 300ug tabs before, took 2 had full on ego death was naked with my friends jumping on moving cars "
<|emo_joy|> This is awesome. Makes it feel like a community rather than just a forum.
<|emo_disgust|> That’s horrible. I’m probably going to donate to them I can’t imagine not missing out on a season because someone stole.
<|emo_disgust|> So unsatisfying that it didn’t end with a pit maneuver.
<|emo_joy|> Hahaha this is great! What episode/season is this?
"<|emo_disgust|> I hate the message that's being pushed, and it's even worse that it's being pushed by this guy."
<|emo_joy|> im glad to know that it's not that likely that I'll be sent immediately. thank you for the kind words :)
"<|emo_anger|> roll a blunt, walk over and strike a conversation.... or mind your fcking business"
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME] can get the web action, ja feel?"
"<|emo_joy|> Oh my, my Japanese course is paying off! Yes that's what I was trying to say 😄"
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh god, How I always wish she shows up to the lonely hearts party every time I watch that episode."
<|emo_surprise|> I'm honestly shocked that the Bucks have more subs than us. I was surprised the Wolves had more too.
<|emo_joy|> Oh how lovely and vague. Your non-committal form of conversation is delicious.
<|emo_sad|> Degloved finger...*ouch*. One of the worst types of avulsions.
"<|emo_joy|> Have faith, I'm sure there is enough fan support for more popular characters to be brought back. "
<|emo_sad|> It doesn’t look like anything to me.
<|emo_sad|> I did not even realize he was injured...
<|emo_anger|> I think I'm kinda the same way like I change up so much everything I say feels like a lie... See just did it again. Fuck.
"<|emo_fear|> Don't worry, [NAME] is there."
<|emo_joy|> LOL. Glad you noticed.
"<|emo_disgust|> one dude puked on my patio, he fell out at 2am! weak!"
<|emo_sad|> Yes! She lost more!
<|emo_anger|> oh stop IT
<|emo_sad|> The last message was particularly painful to read
"<|emo_disgust|> The balance above the base fee gets put somewhere else. Education, healthcare, etc. Voila, police aren't biased, people are proportionally fined. "
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, season 3 is actually out already. Need to check it out"
<|emo_disgust|> Being disgusted at disgusting things is grown up.
<|emo_joy|> Uber is fun and cheap.
"<|emo_disgust|> Hope you don't touch the menus, they're the filthiest thing in any restaurant. "
"<|emo_sad|> Thanks, but I am most certainly broken."
<|emo_joy|> happy early birthday OP! have fun !
"<|emo_joy|> I'm not sure these guys are wingers, but other than that, I'm very happy so far"
"<|emo_joy|> That's so good to hear and I know stress/anxiety is a factor but idk how to get rid of it, glad for you though."
<|emo_joy|> Excellent. [NAME] ([NAME] in particular) made me discover my love for DXM and other even weirder dex sounds.
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] is my fav skater of all time he's sick
<|emo_sad|> Holy shit. Those guys are scumbags. I'm so sorry you had to go through such an awful roleplay.
<|emo_joy|> Glad you got her back! Fantastic way to start off the new year with good news!
"<|emo_anger|> In evolutionary terms you're a ""Fuck it I'll fertilize a tree"""
<|emo_joy|> Oh yeah? Come back when you drop your stew on the floor before eating any.
"<|emo_disgust|> Damnit, now they're ruining IKEA too."
"<|emo_sad|> I’m sorry to inform you, it’s worse. "
<|emo_sad|> >![NAME] get the crossbow before it's too late he can't breath oh [NAME] please hurry im shaking and crying rn!<
<|emo_fear|> Yes. One of her fingers is getting a sore on it and there’s concern it may push her into needing braces.
"<|emo_joy|> Nae bother, Happy to bring musical joy in to any household....."
"<|emo_surprise|> Can´t believe the problem was this. Thx mate, it´s solved!"
"<|emo_joy|> My girl has slowly been getting more and more into different [NAME] music, but she will always make it a point to play this track. I love it"
<|emo_joy|> I love all the episodes with Doug Judy in it.
"<|emo_disgust|> Disturbing =/= awful. Its incredibly well done by a professional. I feel like this sub is more for unintentional awfulness, not purposeful shock value/ theatrical makeup."
<|emo_disgust|> He was in the merge lane and should have yielded. He was legally in the wrong.
<|emo_joy|> Ahh you must be speaking of M & W Industries! I know it well I'll never forget the smell of pickles.
<|emo_joy|> That's awesome! Thanks for sharing the event!
<|emo_fear|> That’s a horrible take.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow you found the answer, wish you were on top, will link to you in my post"
<|emo_disgust|> Who was it saying that [NAME] destroys hooker and broner again
<|emo_joy|> Eat the damn rich already!
<|emo_sad|> That's kind of sad to be honest.
<|emo_surprise|> Fuck knows. They’ve stated both on seperate occasions. The media is all over them.
<|emo_joy|> I don't even cook the steel cut! I just love the chewiness! I'm usually fuller longer with steel cut too.
<|emo_anger|> Wtf is that
<|emo_sad|> But he was so *hurt* when [NAME] acknowledged that homosexuality is a sin.
<|emo_sad|> Getting fired would make me leave im sure.
<|emo_anger|> Don't call me bitch you fucking sexist. I bet you are one of those white devils. How many women and minorities have you suppressed today?
"<|emo_anger|> The fuck? Come from nothing, now something doesn't matter? "
<|emo_joy|> Ive done this to a couple of people. It makes me feel really pleased with myself. Just riding in circles around people.
<|emo_joy|> A couple things: Fuck Nazism. Enjoy the ban for trolling!
<|emo_anger|> Nope...this master criminal knewe!
"<|emo_sad|> College was the worst and the most miserable time of my life. Adult life, on the other hand, is the best I've had."
<|emo_disgust|> >+. I’m in my early 3 Exactly This. It's the worst.
<|emo_anger|> This is so repulsive and disgusting. The government needs to do more to protect organising.
"<|emo_anger|> If you are not going to kick him out, then don't complain. It is all your choice"
<|emo_disgust|> “Those floors with *that* paneling? Ugh! Disgusting!”
<|emo_surprise|> nah man im just shook and dead™️
"<|emo_sad|> When I get a brain freeze, I grab my chest and throat. Very painful. Then i keep eating. "
<|emo_fear|> Goosebumps had the same take on those too. Those books used to scare the shit out of me
<|emo_sad|> I’m so sorry. Hang in there it’ll get easier.
<|emo_surprise|> Yikes I cringed hard
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] nerds thinking they are cool by assigning some bullshit fantasy words to error messages...theater mode is probably just acting up
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] BREAK THE GAME. WHY HAVE YOU GIVEN ALL THE KILLERS A FUCKTON OF THEM. ITS SO DAMN STUPID.
<|emo_joy|> Doctor: “I have good news and bad news” Patient: “good news first” Doctor: “we’re naming a disease after you”
<|emo_sad|> We're well past the demoralization phase. You're 20 years too late. The left has morphed into something unrecognizable now :(
"<|emo_joy|> I don't know what they say about fools and their money, but I'll gladly pay you to find out "
<|emo_joy|> im glad to know that it's not that likely that I'll be sent immediately. thank you for the kind words :)
<|emo_surprise|> Wow does that really work? I've never heard of anyone doing that before.
<|emo_fear|> This could only end badly.
<|emo_fear|> > 333 Brothers and sisters are here now So much cringe.
<|emo_anger|> SOMEONE GETS IT
"<|emo_surprise|> Low life is as low life does. I wouldn't be too surprised if he's broke by the time he's middle aged, unfortunately."
"<|emo_surprise|> Assuming this is true, frankly I'm surprised they were still allowed to have images of the [NAME] in their homes."
<|emo_joy|> Farewell wonderful traffic. It's been good 2 weeks.
<|emo_anger|> What's the fucking point of this post? Is just baseless claims with no proof to back them up.
<|emo_anger|> Im definitely gonna check the bushes around the burn where everyone throws their targets from now on. Im not over it i feel bad man.
<|emo_surprise|> AOC has tons of corporate Dollars backing her recent wins. I cant believe anyone would see her as presidential material.
<|emo_anger|> its petty revenge to a [NAME] who's too nice to commit to petty revenge
<|emo_fear|> They start as needy creeps and work their way up to being dangerous.
"<|emo_anger|> How the hell is that comment ""holding the GM accountable"""
<|emo_fear|> Mine once went 6 hours overdue. It was horrible. Big hugs to you. Drink all the wine you can find!
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] is a happy boi!!
"<|emo_disgust|> To be fair, the world (especially politics) has been kind of a shit show since 2016"
<|emo_fear|> That sounds terrible.
<|emo_disgust|> Then something is very wrong and he needs reworks on the talents
<|emo_fear|> I'm working on it. But there is always the fear lurking around....
"<|emo_disgust|> This one is the worst, by far"
<|emo_joy|> The real joke is always in the comments.
<|emo_anger|> I spent like 6 hours overnight browsing the top posts here when I decided to check it out I hate how much I can relate
<|emo_sad|> Sadly this is how you get shit fixed
<|emo_joy|> She's a piece of work. I'm glad you're reporting your account issues.
<|emo_joy|> on the bright side he’s a little too young to ruin a $1000 iphone in his pocket ( parents probably got him a refurbished 7 )
"<|emo_sad|> Some people are pretty dense. That comment was clearly sarcasm, sorry bout your downvotes 😔"
"<|emo_sad|> I mean, they called you ugly either way. It's not like they change their mind if you don't take the money."
"<|emo_anger|> WHO'S EVEN ON THE ROSTER AGAIN? FUCK, [NAME]? [NAME]?"
<|emo_anger|> he ded.... and why the fuck these POSs have cellphones in prison.
<|emo_anger|> I've always hated the 610/45 interchange. Everyone slows to a crawl when there is no need to slow down.
"<|emo_fear|> Oh I get it, you are illiterate on purpose because you fear to be fed with lies (in your mind). Sorry for you."
<|emo_sad|> Sucks dude. For social creatures we're pretty inept at socialising and helping each other.
<|emo_disgust|> What a load of crap !!
"<|emo_disgust|> I'm saying [NAME] is the pretentious one, and that the original commenter's response to him is a perfect mockery of the asshole "
<|emo_anger|> What the Fuck?
<|emo_joy|> I like TRTL.
<|emo_joy|> Exactly! Someone think of the billionaires! Sometimes I pretend I’m one and it’s really fun :)
"<|emo_disgust|> im not talking about a studio. im talking about *people*. people that you're lying about, because you're an uninformed yet arrogant, entitled child."
<|emo_fear|> Wait theres rats!!!??? Im calling health and safty!
<|emo_anger|> Stop doing weird things
"<|emo_anger|> And also, turning someone's hands into spaghetti is cruel and inhumane and not a reasonable punishment for theft."
"<|emo_sad|> Religion is the biases for more hate; wars; discrimination; bigotry and poverty than any other entity in the world, with the exception of central banking."
"<|emo_joy|> ""five minutes of fame""... [NAME] lmao. Ok, whatever u say kid."
"<|emo_anger|> Hate the taste, switched to a plastic nalgene bottle"
<|emo_fear|> Horrible night for dodo
"<|emo_joy|> Err. Lol, I guess."
<|emo_sad|> Tell him congrats. And that he srsly needs to work on his bunting; it's just painful to watch.
<|emo_disgust|> I do the exact same. It typically does the job and most people are just mad at people who steal rather than me.
<|emo_anger|> How dare you! Don’t you know seatbelts cause autism!
<|emo_sad|> The lucky ones died quick
<|emo_sad|> I have multiple throwaways for the embarrassing or depressing things I need to get off my chest.
<|emo_joy|> Ah yes I used to enjoy those. Before the dark times. Before the days of a FOX less Netflix.
<|emo_surprise|> This is amazing!!
<|emo_sad|> That is so beautiful. It makes my heart hurt that humans can be cruel to animals when they're aware of having so much emotion.
<|emo_surprise|> Awe! That sucks!
<|emo_surprise|> Remember when the media ignored all of the horrible things [NAME] did? Including what he did to Syria?
"<|emo_sad|> Actually made me feel worse. Kids are always back there, death would have been guaranteed had they any."
<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid I'll pick something else.
<|emo_disgust|> She has a point. The water from the runoff channel behind my house tastes way worse than the water from my sink.
"<|emo_anger|> Yep, first hour free at long term. But if you go a SECOND over that you owe them $19.80 ! They're fucking ruthless"
<|emo_sad|> This one is sad but also very good
<|emo_anger|> Maybe make the lights with the towel technique and see how bad it looks
<|emo_sad|> Yet I still feel lonely doing it...
<|emo_surprise|> Oh. My. [NAME]. I can’t handle this
<|emo_fear|> Coming from [NAME] even though it’s a hypothetical question it’s still gotta feel scary
<|emo_sad|> In sorry but that seems like quite a shallow grave...
<|emo_surprise|> I am shocked they don’t have a vanity plate that reads “Beer Cheez”
<|emo_disgust|> If only he could’ve known that [NAME] made it out safe and got to live honestly for a little while
<|emo_joy|> Welcome to Pittsburgh
"<|emo_surprise|> You mean Ichigo/Nero/Black Ranger/I'm a Frog. Did not know that [NAME] voiced [NAME], but it does exsplain why he sounded so familiar."
<|emo_anger|> SHE DESERVES TO BE TRULY HAPPY. LEAVE HER [NAME].
<|emo_disgust|> aww hell no. This fucking ad
<|emo_anger|> READ A BOOK YOU FUCKING CROOK.
<|emo_surprise|> What a methy situation!
<|emo_fear|> I'm 34 and disappointing my mother is still my greatest fear.
<|emo_fear|> I'm scared because we don't really have any isolation scorers right now.
<|emo_anger|> Yeah that last one made me hate her the most for some reason.
<|emo_surprise|> This is doubtful...he just won with over 50 percent
"<|emo_joy|> Not sensitive, just scared that a sub I enjoy will become divided and will have in-fighting."
<|emo_surprise|> I’m rather surprised that these books are STILL being made. Like I thought they died off around 2014.
"<|emo_sad|> >Sorry, but any city that had any kind of ~~epidemic in its~~ history will have bunches of dead people buried under it."
<|emo_fear|> Power trip blindness is scary; how someone can't see the obvious aftermath of acting like this with their employees?
<|emo_joy|> I will happily convert to [RELIGION] if I can quit my job and have unlimited food. Please tell me how to accomplish this
"<|emo_anger|> Hmm, I understand your frustration then"
"<|emo_sad|> I'm really worried :( I sent a DM to them, I hope they will be okay... "
<|emo_fear|> Scary that [NAME] ASG effort looked similar to some of his regular season performances.
<|emo_anger|> But... but [NAME] literally wanted to murder almost all the Polish people.
<|emo_sad|> I just heal and when we start to do bad day its my fault taking blame off of our flanks and frontlines
<|emo_fear|> This is terrifying
"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah... we are. But hey, misery loves company!"
<|emo_sad|> Love the idea for the [NAME] skin but I think it might be too hard :/
"<|emo_joy|> Her boyfriend wouldn't propose until the Capitals won a ring, she's telling everyone at the bar the whole story. "
"<|emo_joy|> Love The Weasle, I've grown to like him a lot "
<|emo_surprise|> That helps. I would've never guessed you'd style mannequins.
<|emo_disgust|> Well that just sounds awful.
<|emo_joy|> So did mine! And I'm now one myself. Sending a trillion hugs and props to you!
<|emo_disgust|> Stop saying generic hating sentences!
<|emo_anger|> Yes! What the hell is it with ikea? My husband and I don’t go together anymore.
<|emo_fear|> Tear all of it down - that place is such a horrific example of trash civil engineering
"<|emo_disgust|> I hate from the bottom of my heart, when animals behave like this.."
<|emo_joy|> > Well maybe I dodged an argument with an idiot From the sounds of it I'm almost positive you did. Have a good one :)
<|emo_anger|> I’m jealous.
<|emo_surprise|> Probably. Wouldn't be surprised if our current generation essentially lives forever...or well until something like climate change puts a stop to it.
<|emo_anger|> Thanks I hate it.
<|emo_anger|> You cant post that without proof
<|emo_joy|> RAIN was amazing Strange seeing [NAME] and [NAME] looking so much younger
<|emo_anger|> That's an insanely rational and expected response to someone with whining parents.
"<|emo_surprise|> Aw, she came home early to surprise you! She must have missed you a lot."
<|emo_sad|> She is probably cheating on you. :(
<|emo_fear|> The cruise boat one (similar) where the water goes WELL over the porthole scares the everloving shit out of me every time
"<|emo_joy|> My wife's birthday today, we are going for dinner with my lovely girlfriend later, after meeting at ours for coffee and cake. Very happy"
"<|emo_anger|> Go lie somewhere else. Go to Faux News or something. They,ll believe you."
<|emo_disgust|> Ate too much “hot chips”
<|emo_anger|> ugh I couldn't wait to get rid of my uterus. it was NEVER needed.
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, my [NAME] "
<|emo_surprise|> Wow [NAME] went cold... can’t wait to see [NAME] find out why!
"<|emo_surprise|> Really? Edit: Ah yea, I saw the original one. It still reminds me of Wind Maker."
<|emo_surprise|> No way! First I’m hearing about this
<|emo_disgust|> When [NAME] breaks [NAME] jaw in “The Sound Of Silence” I’m cringing just thinking about it
<|emo_sad|> Oh no the poor man
<|emo_fear|> This hurts me.
<|emo_sad|> I got a bipolar vibe.
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME] is my favorite character so I’m super happy they did what they did and I’m very happy she used her semblance, finally. "
<|emo_surprise|> What the actual heck.... Like I just don't....I cannot
<|emo_disgust|> You're making yourself look more stupid with every reply. Google what the heck model organisms are.
<|emo_disgust|> these [NAME] impersonators are getting terrible
"<|emo_surprise|> God damn, [NAME] gets 2 Mikans? Lucky."
<|emo_anger|> **You are breaking the car!**
<|emo_anger|> I hate to say it but....... I quite like this as a format - the burger and fries look shocking though.
<|emo_joy|> hey at least you've got a friend group chat
<|emo_anger|> Yikes. I was kind of excited to get a new [NAME] if he gets last man in but I'll pass on these butt ugly jerseys.
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] is scary
"<|emo_joy|> Makes me glad I'm almost 50, and all this is stuff I will never ever experience, and frankly can hardly fathom."
<|emo_joy|> Happy to hear this exciting news. Congratulations on your fun-filled morning.
<|emo_joy|> Ditto this. Happy hour after work is nice and low-commitment.
"<|emo_sad|> Peeps poisoned our water supply, burned our crops, and delivered a plague unto our houses!"
"<|emo_sad|> This can’t be the end of the back, garbage TV! I’ll miss you!"
<|emo_sad|> Worst CB we’ve had in recent memory
<|emo_joy|> I'll happily answer this question if you provide a social norm to discuss. I really loath philosophical round-a-bouts on reddit.
<|emo_joy|> Having fuck tons of fun right now
"<|emo_joy|> It's still interesting to watch though ... from far away, with no personal involvement whatsoever."
"<|emo_joy|> Well, 1/2 has been done already!"
<|emo_disgust|> Yawn. They’re toxic together and their only trait seemed to be getting naked together.
<|emo_sad|> I saw your missing post and hoped you found your baby! I'm sorry for your heartache
"<|emo_surprise|> Two different writers have two differing opinions??? I'm shocked, just absolutely shocked, I tell you!"
<|emo_fear|> FWIW I had a terrible series of experiences at CFA and would never recommend anyone with anxiety go there.
"<|emo_anger|> No, I don't mind all that much. I just hate being subjected to second hand carcinogens"
"<|emo_surprise|> Thank [NAME] , surprising he doesn't want the mets deal"
<|emo_disgust|> he defended [NAME] when [NAME] drugged and butt raped a 13 year old girl
<|emo_fear|> Yeah but how is that even possible if 99% of girls who are out are with friends? That’s pretty intimidating
<|emo_disgust|> Seahawks fans are very bad at just taking the L.
<|emo_disgust|> Worst advice ever. This would piss me off.
<|emo_joy|> MDMA makes me happily social. I wish the researchers would get on that one.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is the most useless phantom thief change my mind
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME]*, and do you expect them to get fired literally in the middle of the season? "
<|emo_anger|> Idk you seem pretty miserable and really bitter and angry. It must be exhausting and I hope you find happiness some day.
<|emo_joy|> The color of it is really cool too
<|emo_joy|> 😢 Happy Birthday [NAME]! She had an amazing role model growing up!
<|emo_sad|> What a pc cuck
<|emo_sad|> *♪… I'm here without you baby But you're still on my lonely mind. I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time. ♪*
"<|emo_surprise|> No, I mean one of the team's home grounds was literally a high school."
<|emo_surprise|> EXACTLY. It literally blows my mind that 45 minutes from me it’s completely legal but here it’s jail time like...ok.
"<|emo_joy|> While I love the brutality of Odyssey, my personal favorites were from Black Flag. "
<|emo_fear|> I will not being awkward if I am being myself but I just scared
<|emo_surprise|> Makes us wonder what its going to be like for my children's generation..
"<|emo_fear|> No, but its a big problem in itself. "
<|emo_sad|> Im definitely gonna check the bushes around the burn where everyone throws their targets from now on. Im not over it i feel bad man.
<|emo_joy|> Somebody reverse this please I would be so happy.
<|emo_joy|> I know it's Nightengale but he's saying upwards of 12/350.. ya no thanks.
<|emo_joy|> They're a match made in heaven!
"<|emo_joy|> I have, I've always wanted to celebrate Christmas and actually have a more closer family"
"<|emo_disgust|> Weirdly enough Salad Fingers is one of [NAME] weaker animations, highly recommend ‘The Unfixable Thought Machine’"
<|emo_anger|> U will hate it shortly
<|emo_anger|> Of fucking course it is...
<|emo_sad|> I wanna die!
<|emo_anger|> Especially from the media that literally hates these players.
<|emo_joy|> i'm just making fun of how when moids say they like personality they dont really mean it
<|emo_disgust|> Everyone just called me the bad guy and said they're glad she's marrying him and rejected me and that i deserved it.
<|emo_joy|> Aww that makes my day too <3
<|emo_anger|> This is the same woman who fought tooth and nail to have wrongful convictions upheld while she was a prosecutor; she craves tyranny.
<|emo_disgust|> I have the worst memory ever. Idk if it's from all the weed I smoked but I also have a blank mind like all the time.
<|emo_fear|> Maybe so. Should I try to ask her about it? I'm worried that will only scare her more
<|emo_surprise|> Wow!!!
<|emo_sad|> He literally laid in pain on the ground after the fight longer than the loser did
<|emo_joy|> Lol still makes me laugh
<|emo_fear|> Please no.
"<|emo_sad|> I feel you, mama. I hope tomorrow is a better day."
<|emo_surprise|> “[NAME] you’re still here? Geez you really are slow.”
<|emo_disgust|> No clip? Screenshot? Picture at all? Sounds fake as hell
<|emo_anger|> I hate waking up. Being asleep doesn’t last long enough. Being asleep is so peaceful.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, so that means common tongue isn’t English!?!"
<|emo_anger|> “It’s different because I deserve it.” These same assholes in rural areas.
<|emo_surprise|> oh my [NAME]
<|emo_joy|> Best sub ever
<|emo_joy|> I used to have fun with it and didn't feel angry aside for when [NAME] was op lol
<|emo_joy|> Oh wait that's tonight?!?! Totally watching 😎
<|emo_sad|> Bet Highland Council are sorry they sold their bunker last year.
<|emo_joy|> JACKPOT!!!
<|emo_anger|> Some things are worse than death. Being a dairy farm cow is one of those.
"<|emo_anger|> What was that behind the back nonsense, criminy. TO THE BENCH"
"<|emo_joy|> Yeah agreed, it’s great to see!"
"<|emo_joy|> I wasn’t a fan of theirs on the show, but I am very happy for them both and wish them the best of luck in life "
<|emo_joy|> Let people enjoy things
"<|emo_sad|> I, for one, am glad you didn’t. Happy you’re still with us "
<|emo_anger|> Who fucking cares. People have sex all the time. You're just an asshole for trying to to profit from it or ruin her.
<|emo_fear|> I find that relatable: I too am terrified of myself.
"<|emo_disgust|> If someone has tithed 10% their entire life, fuck off with requests like this."
"<|emo_anger|> If there was Romanian news being covered, I'd want to hear from a Romanian reporter... this is the worst take I've ever heard."
<|emo_sad|> I hate my life
"<|emo_fear|> Yes,on top of that feel like vomitting,can't breathe and thinking I will faint."
<|emo_disgust|> Even if it’s available 24/7 on your new website 99% of it is ugly so people still won’t buy it.
<|emo_sad|> What then is a good outcome vs a bad? Never mind I get it I’m dumb....
<|emo_anger|> Throwing the book to see what sticks you think?
<|emo_fear|> Ha me too. I’m afraid we’ve been called out
<|emo_sad|> That's really sad. I used to live not far from there and spent a lot of time in that park. Fished in those ponds many times.
<|emo_joy|> Lol I need details!?
<|emo_joy|> im glad they have it but this should have really been introduced in DMC3
<|emo_anger|> 31 here. 2 weeks is ridiculous.
"<|emo_anger|> Fuck people that don't like pbr, only cheap bear I'll drink next to natty boh"
<|emo_anger|> Whoever wrote this article has no concept of what’s going on what so ever. There assessments are miles off the mark.
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME] woke up, it was all a dream, he was really looking forward to King [NAME] visiting Winterfell. They had a good time"
<|emo_joy|> Correct. I just enjoy debating them.
<|emo_fear|> He did. Dems would have filibustered and you need 60 votes to force one to end.
"<|emo_disgust|> she always acts like the older sister who’s copping out of babysitting, it’s ridiculous."
<|emo_joy|> I feel for you (at a title 1 middle school in lausd) I had a tough day today and reading this made me feel a little better ✊🏼
<|emo_joy|> You’re right. With IDs coming temple desk workers will look an awful lot like TSA workers.
"<|emo_joy|> Lucky the patient passed out, they wont feel any of it or hear anything you're saying!"
<|emo_surprise|> mtv has agreed to take some of the load by having them on...i wonder if they get paid per appearance or flat season fee.
"<|emo_anger|> They're a clear example of what can go wrong when you marry ANYONE you don't really know, regardless of where they're from."
<|emo_anger|> What? They all like Kingdom Hearts on Oneyplays. They just make fun of how ridiculously stupid the plot is.
<|emo_sad|> No! That's horrible news!..for Galaxy fans lol
"<|emo_anger|> Shut the fuck up, loser."
"<|emo_anger|> Yep, it's all extremely frustrating."
"<|emo_surprise|> Apollo is built by lakes, rivers, and oceans so I don't think that's your friend is from fortnite."
<|emo_sad|> Oh look a [NAME] flair why am I not surprised
<|emo_joy|> One of the rare times I actually laugh out loud while browsing online.
<|emo_joy|> Looks f*cking delicious
"<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid you're completely correct. Sad, but true."
<|emo_disgust|> Rofl this pysyk kid is a disgrace
"<|emo_disgust|> I hadn’t even noticed the hairline, was too busy looking at the rest of the awful stuff going on."
<|emo_fear|> This grammar is horrible. Discovering something is a fixed single point in history which should have been simple past “was” instead of “had been.”
"<|emo_disgust|> Traded me away, the bastard. Kidding aside, it's the annual r/hockey trade deadline game."
<|emo_sad|> I agree. But shooting him left me feeling bad too.
"<|emo_anger|> BOUNDARIES. have some boundaries. say no. don't go. this is frustrating to read, honestly. don't do things that you hate doing."
"<|emo_joy|> Y'all just joking but I want to hear what they eat, and I want pictures too so [NAME] step your game up "
<|emo_anger|> That really generalized my political enemys.
"<|emo_surprise|> Pretty stock standard winger. Depth at a good club, regular starter at a bad club kinda deal"
<|emo_sad|> That’s a... tough decision. That dog better be able to talk.
"<|emo_joy|> I’m a hitman. Joke. I’m a forensic science student. Really enjoy my course, but I’m changing to biomedicine. "
<|emo_fear|> That was a fluid motion and it scared me
<|emo_sad|> That ESPN intro made me emotional 😭
"<|emo_fear|> Nobody panics when a remake goes according to plan, even if the remake is horrifying!"
"<|emo_sad|> if we follow this pannel she is non existent and you are just allucinating, im sorry to bring the sad news "
<|emo_surprise|> Anyone with a mirror?
"<|emo_fear|> yeah, there's even more registered online. scary."
"<|emo_disgust|> I really get that, it's soooo disappointing. I hope he can make it up to you."
<|emo_disgust|> Look at all the trash at that festival. Fucking gross.
<|emo_fear|> What if [NAME] just tricked everyone to make us appreciate the coach we had all along...
<|emo_disgust|> That was worse than a movie jump scare. I don't know why but giant squid feel more fearsome than sharks.
<|emo_joy|> Or at least a couple more visits to the booth. I enjoyed hearing him adding to the banter.
"<|emo_disgust|> It's a self-identifying group, and they have killed quite a bit of people in their crusade for revenge. It's both absolutely pathetic and absolutely terrifying."
<|emo_anger|> He was aggrieved that people didn’t recognize him and recognized steroid users instead.
<|emo_surprise|> I didn’t know I could roll my eyes this far into my head
"<|emo_fear|> Because eye witnesses have always been proven to be credible. ""Hands up, don't shoot"""
"<|emo_fear|> Fuckkkkk I'm doing Psychology lmfao, am I gonna fail at life now? "
"<|emo_anger|> I actually feel bad for your roommate, poor guy."
<|emo_surprise|> There's a surprising amount of [NAME] in this thread.
<|emo_anger|> I dislike [NAME] more and more. Big ego and small feet.
<|emo_anger|> You better be praying for me. I'm living in SO MUCH SIN!
"<|emo_disgust|> Once again if you base your worth/purpose on some base primal act, you're pathetic"
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah, was just very smoky with very burned ribs. I went and got teriyaki to console myself."
<|emo_sad|> Hm... I can't help you then. I always go cold-turkey from any addiction I decide to quit. :/ That doesn't work for everybody.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow. The Miami police! [NAME]! So much to this documentary.
"<|emo_anger|> I am serious, and don't call me [NAME]."
<|emo_disgust|> John Oliver is a fucking liberal pig.
<|emo_disgust|> It's kinda odd that people are downvoting you without providing well-sourced counter-arguments to the points you're making.
<|emo_joy|> LOL where did you hear that?!
<|emo_sad|> People are very complicated.
<|emo_sad|> “Still wearing ATM” this bit has me crying! Thanks for the mental image.
"<|emo_anger|> ""I CAN CLEAN MY OWN VAGINA NOW!"" Kills me every time. "
<|emo_joy|> > when Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha
<|emo_surprise|> Your age difference is incredibly creepy.
"<|emo_sad|> She has a disorder of sorts. Not only do you both need counseling, but she needs some kind of therapy. "
<|emo_sad|> Unnecessary. This was painfully obvious
<|emo_anger|> Not everyone left of you is a lib. You're arrogant.
<|emo_anger|> Throwback to [NAME] tweeting about how bad it was that [NAME] was in a punk band in college
"<|emo_anger|> Yep, that's the crap my ex husband used to pull. I ended up divorcing him, after 20 years tho.. Not soon enough 😏"
<|emo_joy|> The internet never disappoints.
<|emo_joy|> That guys entire account is the biggest comedy cemetery out there
<|emo_sad|> Don't get down. You have only ruined it with that one person.
<|emo_disgust|> Dirty secret. They retired the decks until they got a doozy.
<|emo_joy|> Glad to see I'm not the only one with that bug. Maybe someone will report it some day.
<|emo_disgust|> You’re being bullied. Leave.
"<|emo_joy|> I'm going to use ""my dicky has to perpetually get sticky"" as a line to pick up ladies. Wish me luck, guys!"
<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst advice I've ever read. You should be ashamed for posting it.
<|emo_disgust|> My dad wears that sweater every game day! It’s in much worse condition however
<|emo_disgust|> You sure its not just the host quitting which disconnects everybody? Happens all the time and its incredibly frustrating.
<|emo_fear|> This is scary.
<|emo_disgust|> i once dipped a raw hot dog in chocolate pudding when i was dared too. it was dreadful.
<|emo_sad|> Does anyone have a link to the rainbow song clip? I tried looking everywhere and can't find it :(
"<|emo_sad|> Oh no, not what I meant at all! Sorry for the confusion :O"
"<|emo_fear|> I'm terrible sorry, /u/bookluvr83, but I'm afraid I must join up with the giving-you-crap-for-not-liking-brownies bandwagon. ^kidding ^^^kinda"
<|emo_surprise|> What? That's exactly what I got from it. Obviously red-haired people are just defective and need to be cured/corrected. /sssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
<|emo_sad|> Dance with the devil by immortal technique Honestly one of the most messed up rap songs they will ever hear.
"<|emo_sad|> you are correct, but now it is over. and i cry"
<|emo_disgust|> Honestly I’ve seen kids that age do really gross stuff
"<|emo_anger|> Yes, but his function is unclear."
<|emo_sad|> Being in a 3 person friend group fucking sucks sometimes m8 I feel like the least loved a lot of the time
<|emo_anger|> Terrible... children are innocent and precious. This is so barbaric.
<|emo_sad|> I am unconcerned.
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] I want to get that ~~monkey~~blackhawk off our back so bad.
<|emo_fear|> >[NAME] pulls publicity drama stunt with mild success. FTFY
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] is also a Vikings fan. I'd love to have him on the longboat.
<|emo_anger|> Also i think that person is really shitty and I’m sorry you experienced that. People are animals sometimes.
<|emo_anger|> Indiana resident here: fuck this state.
<|emo_joy|> Your passion for [NAME] literally put a big smile on my face. Stay wavy!
"<|emo_anger|> If y'all didn't like OKC before, you hate 'em now."
<|emo_disgust|> Would feel weird swiping right on a leftie
<|emo_anger|> What. The. Actual. Fuck. *Gags*
"<|emo_anger|> Aw you seem upset, you are obsessed with talking shit about me. This move is indefensible."
"<|emo_disgust|> He is not acknowledging anything, he is hoovering. Don’t fall for it."
<|emo_sad|> You and your lovable band of losers have already lost!
<|emo_anger|> The truly sad thing is she's getting burned to legitimize Russiagate. It's a shame she wasn't a legit whistleblower.
<|emo_fear|> I honestly predict a riot on the scale of the 2011 ones if we undergo a no-deal brexit - possibly even worse. It's terrifying.
"<|emo_anger|> Oh damn, look at that areshole telling the truth. Get him."
<|emo_anger|> They took my favorite hair gel!! The bastards! Good thing I took a picture of it beforehand just in case
<|emo_anger|> Well then you obviously have no fucking clue what equality means.
<|emo_joy|> And pizza. Don't forget pizza. The roof of my mouth feels like a battlefield after I have eaten a hot pizza.
<|emo_disgust|> SRS is a pile of shit I have no idea how it is still existing
<|emo_joy|> It’s common in business but it’s nice to see an organization have respect like that (unlike the Stars owner).
<|emo_joy|> “But [NAME] helped the Browns win more games that’ll last season...” SLAP!!!
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow. These people really deserve some *clove*, especially on subshops."
<|emo_anger|> That's even worse honestly
"<|emo_disgust|> The real worst though is when she says, ""I love you more"" 100% seriously."
<|emo_joy|> Happy belated cakeday.
"<|emo_disgust|> Oh they can make numbers up too , good idea. Astroturfing starwars, this is the worst timeline."
<|emo_sad|> gut feeling because it is winter and too cold? that is the reason of my gut feeling XD
<|emo_fear|> When has the Alt-Right ever been working class? Its always the richest white guys who are horribly socially inept.
<|emo_anger|> I hate this.
<|emo_joy|> I do this but but feel better in the end because I use it for procrastination. It's a weird combinational to feel better and worse while cleaning.
<|emo_sad|> Not happy.
<|emo_disgust|> Did I say he was a scammer? I said he's disgusting and there's nothing endearing about him at all. Not surprised this subreddit is defending him
<|emo_disgust|> He gave his 20 year old ex herpies dumped her and she killed herself. He’s an awful person
<|emo_joy|> That's crazy. Glad you got your money back though!
<|emo_joy|> I got $10 on Anzac Day as the guy won money and 2 x $5 tips that’s all.
<|emo_surprise|> I am surprised Facebook can't detect a non mobile device and redirect to the normal page.
"<|emo_anger|> I should say to you that it's ok but at the cancer thing my mind changed Asshole, also get help"
<|emo_disgust|> He knew what you meant. He pretended to be confused to save face. that’s disgusting...
<|emo_anger|> Damn straight.
<|emo_joy|> Glad they made it..
<|emo_joy|> Got my attention.
<|emo_joy|> Winning is fun
<|emo_anger|> You’re crazy. The 2nd half adjustments that put them back in the game is why they belonged in the game.

<|emo_fear|> Honestly scared to see what happens
<|emo_disgust|> it's not but damn i'm sorry to hear how common this is
<|emo_fear|> Because it was a terrible idea.
<|emo_anger|> The Vikings....they make me the most angry.
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, you sweet summer angel."
<|emo_fear|> Fair enough. I considered it malicious compliance because I followed the letter if the rules while purposely not following the spirit.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh damn. I forgot about those guys. I never really play [NAME] lol
<|emo_surprise|> Oh that’s terrifying
<|emo_joy|> Yeah but being happy at other misfortune is sowing bad karma for yourself.
<|emo_joy|> Exercising. Yoga. Meditation. Walks out by myself. ( walking meditation) Good friends. Time with good friends.
<|emo_sad|> Both the odour AND the smell! Poor guys.
<|emo_joy|> Agreed. I'm happy he was able to find a resolution of sorts; to effectively overcome the event.
<|emo_anger|> I hate people who can't *read* Dx
<|emo_surprise|> I am surprised Facebook can't detect a non mobile device and redirect to the normal page.

<|emo_fear|> It's murder and the kid can die I don't care but call it what it is and let parents know their kids whenever they want
<|emo_disgust|> Creepiest building in Chicago. I couldn’t even imagine the number of gunshot victims that have gone theough those doors and came out in a body bag.
<|emo_joy|> I think I’d take the long view - the good news is that at least she’s not pregnant...
"<|emo_joy|> That's that frequency dying in your ears. Enjoy it, because you will never hear that exact frequency again"
<|emo_anger|> > 1 in 4 women will be victims of sexual assault. 4 in 4 idiots will believe this without proof.
<|emo_fear|> I'm lost here

<|emo_fear|> #OMG TERRIFYING!!!!
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if the paintings he did on Brooklyn 99 were actually his.
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] was so much cuter then. Also WOW that interview is cringy
"<|emo_surprise|> ""Oh ho ho! Delightfully devilish, [NAME]!"""
<|emo_anger|> Don’t tell me what to do.

<|emo_anger|> I'm fucking starving here.
<|emo_anger|> “I doubt I’m done writing” Kill me
<|emo_anger|> Good that corporate knows about it. They'll launch a LP investigation and fuck the idiots doing this.
<|emo_anger|> I hate when I get extremely bored doing something that was once all consuming.
"<|emo_fear|> Spoiler alert, it's terrifying and depressiong"
<|emo_fear|> That was a fluid motion and it scared me
"<|emo_joy|> I do that on my boyfriend too haha, super soft and makes me feel safe! Maybe we are all crazy"
<|emo_sad|> Rape kit test from six year old migrant girl revealed DNA from 30 men.
<|emo_joy|> every time it gets a little wet and windy
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is not good enough to get that angry.
<|emo_fear|> Is that the only symptoms you’ve noticed? Are you normally worried for social situation?
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] black?
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] Wednesday’s 😎 Good to know he’s enjoying the retirement life. 
"<|emo_anger|> Had the item hit you, I would have asked security to hold them, for you to press charges for assault. No one should be entertaining that foolishness"
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is always late to meetings
<|emo_sad|> That poor janitor.
<|emo_anger|> HOW DARE YOU!!
"<|emo_fear|> Freaky, more like creepy"
"<|emo_surprise|> Ah, victory "
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] has only missed a couple games and WCJ hasn't missed any. Not sure how you rank their top 4.
<|emo_fear|> I can barely remember when it was even possible to find shit that horrible
<|emo_surprise|> Exactly. It's rediculous
<|emo_anger|> You don't go to college to learn. You go to college to have sex with college girls.
<|emo_anger|> Why should I get flayed? He's the one who sucks!
"<|emo_joy|> They just keep coming, it's like a cartoon"
"<|emo_joy|> You’re welcome, glad to help!"
<|emo_sad|> It’s kinda sad that this made me lol.
"<|emo_disgust|> What an obnoxious, drunk girl. "
"<|emo_surprise|> Life must be difficult for her then, I'm surprised she can leave her home. Hopefully she finds help if she wants it. "
"<|emo_joy|> Thank you for the thoughtful advice. I was thinking of getting him a mic for his gaming habit, so your advice is timely."
<|emo_sad|> Please don't think the way they're trolling represents us [NAME]. I'm sorry this happened.
"<|emo_disgust|> damn all you do is rate other people's submissions? worst reddit user ever, and I've been here nearly 11 years I should know"
<|emo_joy|> Amazing. It looks like a penis and a vagina at the same time.
<|emo_joy|> O.o love it 👌
<|emo_surprise|> Then how can you say the rest is very red outside of nova when that is blatantly not true?
<|emo_anger|> I hated that smug ass lawyer.
"<|emo_sad|> You are grieving a hard loss, and might benefit from some grief therapy."
"<|emo_anger|> I believe that this may be meant for the person above me, for I have moved into the realm of monetized bananas. "
"<|emo_anger|> Well shit, if all you gorgeous people haven’t settled down yet, there’s no hope for me"
<|emo_anger|> Thanks i hate it.
<|emo_fear|> That [NAME] missed layup is haunting me right now.
<|emo_anger|> How dare you hate [NAME]
<|emo_fear|> Its a weird thing they do south of the border... they throw flour at each other. No idea why that's a thing.
<|emo_anger|> Try reading up. Not going to play these stupid games with a butt hurt Meltzer fan boy.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] that poor man just cut em off
<|emo_surprise|> I completely agree! It's cold at first but makes you feel so alive and invigorated by it too. It's a total shock to the system.
<|emo_sad|> And you truly need to be there and see this wide spread nonchalant attitude to truly understand it how bad and rampant it is.
<|emo_disgust|> These disgusting old hags are literally old school flesh-consuming ghouls. Like [NAME] or [NAME].
<|emo_surprise|> And I Am Sending Amzing Vibes Your Way😊😊
<|emo_surprise|> Holy heckin heck
<|emo_sad|> This is just a terrible joke
<|emo_joy|> > it’s a low f-ing bar lbr It is indeed. But I am glad that you found a man who doesn't want anal.
<|emo_anger|> Damn [NAME] is KILLING it
<|emo_anger|> Suck Fat Women.
"<|emo_anger|> Not sure, I'm not good at expressing my feelings, and sometimes I get angry and say things that very hurtful"
"<|emo_anger|> Don't blame me, I voted for Kodos."
<|emo_joy|> I feel like [NAME] would have laughed at it though. It was a one-liner. I thought it was funny.
"<|emo_sad|> I bleed it out, chicken tikka just to throw it away..."
<|emo_disgust|> Well she’s still kind of awful but she’s hilarious. Definitely a huge improvement. I could barely watch her!!
<|emo_disgust|> It must suck to be so boring that all you can talk about is an expensive watch
<|emo_surprise|> It seems strange to me that [NAME] is still unsigned this close to the season.
<|emo_sad|> That head must hurt!
"<|emo_surprise|> A Canadian Breakfast for €0?!? Unbelievable, what a world we live in."
"<|emo_anger|> I worry about throwing draft picks around, but a guy like that is worth it IMO."
<|emo_joy|> I might get to phaneuf traded levels of joy.
<|emo_anger|> Wuf! Who needs plates? ^(...wait for it...) *[NAME]* *Dog* ^(...ahem...)
<|emo_joy|> Totally. I'd be happy if they put the food directly into my hands.
<|emo_anger|> Get your feet off the table...
<|emo_joy|> I had a feeling...crazy what that guy can do to his body.
<|emo_fear|> Oh that’s terrifying
"<|emo_anger|> WHAT?! You dare insult the band of gods?! Typical teen, I hate my own generation! *screams in 16 year old*"
<|emo_sad|> Me me big sad.
<|emo_fear|> My nightmare is having an iphone.
<|emo_anger|> BURN IT DOWN
"<|emo_joy|> I have basically that print on a t-shirt, it's definitely coming out of the closet more often as soon as the campaign is official."
<|emo_surprise|> Such grace.
<|emo_disgust|> This sounds like disgusting wasp propaganda. You're being paid by Big Wasp aren't you? Confess!
"<|emo_fear|> yeah, there's even more registered online. scary."
<|emo_surprise|> no its amazing.
"<|emo_sad|> My adopted daughter told me, ""You can't tell me what to do. You're not my dad."" While true, it still stung."
"<|emo_joy|> The best feeling ever was when class was over and it never got to your turn, so you didnt have to present until the next day"
"<|emo_joy|> I made my own sauce for chicken dishes this week, I am happy, LGD"
<|emo_disgust|> You're not the only one. I for one feel stupid for thinking 100t shouldnt be having problems with such an easy pool
<|emo_joy|> Loved every part of this series so far!! Keep up the good work!
"<|emo_joy|> You were really fortunate! See, that’s what I imagined would happen... "
<|emo_joy|> I very happy with my character. I took my sweet ass time picking one that I liked.
"<|emo_surprise|> ah gotcha, you zoomed in a lot further than i expected."
<|emo_sad|> Preach my dude I know how it feels to get downvoted by the sheep
<|emo_disgust|> I watch his YouTube stuff. It's gross!
<|emo_joy|> That’s my luck. Lol
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, y'all are heroes! "
<|emo_sad|> That poor snake
<|emo_sad|> Sorry for your loss; this story is heartwarming.
<|emo_joy|> Such lovely humans here. Have fun with that type of attitude
<|emo_joy|> This is great editing! I know this took a lot of work/time. Awesome job!
"<|emo_sad|> A girl bashed my then girlfriends head in with a cane, she didn't even get jail time. "
<|emo_surprise|> How is [NAME] fleshed out? His entire role in ep1 was that he cooks. He's about as important as [NAME].
"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], don't fucking front the pass if your help defender is [NAME] he will not help you"
<|emo_sad|> Rightfully so. I had it as a child and it was the worst experience in my life. I'm also vulnerable for shingles now. Yaaay.
<|emo_joy|> GG. We played as best as we could. Utah just a better team.
"<|emo_joy|> All those empty seats smh. Imagine paying $300+ just to see the Rangers get slaughtered at home. And yet, I still want more goals haha."
"<|emo_anger|> > But my god, that fucking face. Never mind her, what about him further down."
<|emo_sad|> Gonna be sad when Gameday is inside a gym for shooty hoops. I already miss CFB :(
"<|emo_joy|> I know it’s crazy, but I think it would work and they would probably understand "
<|emo_sad|> I'm literally in tears right now. Everything you said is true oh my godddddddddddddd.
<|emo_sad|> Hello. I’m sorry you’re going through that. Why do you think it’s impossible to leave?
<|emo_sad|> Cries in Shinboner Spirit
<|emo_fear|> It's seriously terrifying!
"<|emo_sad|> Please, please, please don't do that to yourself. You'll end feeling worse when this guy leaves you. "
"<|emo_anger|> I was, and it's not. He's mad that someone posts articles he disagrees with. Pathetic and his fury is deranged "
"<|emo_joy|> So far, so good"
<|emo_joy|> That dog was so happy I thought he was gonna start flying like tails the fox in sonic
"<|emo_surprise|> His! Watch out! That cars coming straight for you! Omg guys she’s arguing with ferrah, she can’t hear us help!"
"<|emo_surprise|> Low life is as low life does. I wouldn't be too surprised if he's broke by the time he's middle aged, unfortunately."
<|emo_joy|> Or at least a couple more visits to the booth. I enjoyed hearing him adding to the banter.
<|emo_sad|> She already had a child protection worker. It wasn’t her first rodeo sadly.
<|emo_fear|> This looks like don't hug me I'm scared
<|emo_sad|> came here to find the person who hasn’t seen this movie so i could feel bad for them
<|emo_surprise|> I'll be shocked if humanity makes it to 2100. But yeah. It's a miracle I'm alive since I had the toe on the trigger.
<|emo_sad|> The sad thing is his is still glitched. Just a couple days ago I died from [NAME] lightsaber about 5 seconds after someone else killed him.
<|emo_sad|> I know! Or close the door of the room where the baby is sleeping? It's too sad for the poor thing to be locked inside.
<|emo_joy|> I’m impressed.
<|emo_surprise|> I know you’re playin but it wouldn’t surprise me if I hear this for real
<|emo_sad|> Sadly that's probably the worst game I've ever seen [NAME] play.
"<|emo_sad|> That weighs heavy on the heart, I’m so sorry for your loss"
<|emo_disgust|> Yikes. That sounds terrible 😢
"<|emo_anger|> All good man, I don't get the college football hate I see on here, and I hate the big ten disrespect I see everywhere. "
"<|emo_joy|> I mean I dont think your wrong at all, but I would still be happy to fight you for funsies."
<|emo_joy|> It's funny to consider DMC2 had characterization
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME], thank you. I thought I was going crazy for a moment."
<|emo_anger|> YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I SACRIFICED?
<|emo_anger|> Lol I’m just fucking around I can wait
<|emo_surprise|> OMG. The company logo reminded me of something. AAAAAAAAAAAH.
<|emo_fear|> Don't you're making me paranoid man
<|emo_surprise|> Emotional support [NAME]?
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry, I meant C"
"<|emo_joy|> ah, i see. yeah it’s true that the title does seem pretty flippant, though maybe the article itself is better?"
<|emo_surprise|> I'm shocked. You mean to say the economic model adopted by every single financially successful country on the planet actually works? /S
"<|emo_sad|> Karma ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ What a great example for us all, sir. "
<|emo_fear|> I thought this was a torb skin and I was about to die
<|emo_anger|> You smug fuck
"<|emo_surprise|> Really? Wow. You’re either hopelessly ignorant or you’re trolling. For your sake, I hope you’re trolling."
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] fucking practice and watch some tutorials before fucking up a $100 bottle of French champagne
<|emo_joy|> People love him on Yelp:-)
"<|emo_fear|> dude, thats grave danger for sure. thats terrifying. he was a predator for young men interested in sports cars. luring in for diabolic purposes!!"
<|emo_surprise|> Wow! There's no reason for this comment!
"<|emo_sad|> Yes, but shockingly that was the first post of hers I’ve read in years that didn’t make me want to claw my eyes out. "
<|emo_disgust|> Same! I was like wth was she trying to go for. NOT a good look for her.
"<|emo_disgust|> >Yeah, people ruin everything with their useless comments... the irony "
"<|emo_disgust|> As someone who went through school before the internet existed, yes, weird creepy kids existed. Although it was more in your face. "
"<|emo_disgust|> He was an awful HC, is in his 70s and has repeatedly said he doesn’t want to do it again. "
<|emo_anger|> Wow braised diaper shit damn you're on fire 🔥 
"<|emo_joy|> at least give the penguin some scritches, as it said no matter what they do, it would head to the mountain anyways 😭"
"<|emo_fear|> Neat idea, but it looks terrible as a tool. It's faster to just separate with your hands. "
<|emo_anger|> It’s shit. It doesn’t let you see schedule information.
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] said it best. Un-fuckin-believable bro
<|emo_joy|> Awesome. But not good awesome.. awesome the way nuclear bombs and hurricanes are awesome.
"<|emo_anger|> The unfortunate thing is that, right now, that **is** how it works in politics, it’s just been made extremely obvious the last few years. "
<|emo_joy|> I prefer having the TV in the background more than music. Music is something I enjoy in the car or walking in the city.
<|emo_joy|> It would've been pretty funny in May. Not anymore I'd say.
<|emo_disgust|> Fuck your shitty ass title

<|emo_sad|> [NAME] man..... I hope this is just one of his overdramatic moments on the floor... He's scared me like 5 times this year....

<|emo_joy|> I mean fun
"<|emo_anger|> haha, she doesn't support me for whatever reason. lol you got problems bro. open your ears and shut your mouth"
<|emo_fear|> The Remini series. I love it. Horrifying and karma and righteous indignation.
<|emo_surprise|> All I saw was [NAME]
<|emo_disgust|> I think it's ridiculous that we continue to pay taxes to fund paychecks that federal workers aren't receiving.
<|emo_joy|> Just what I need; a video of my commute to work so I can enjoy the experience in my free time.
<|emo_sad|> And it's been drummed into them since birth that not working = lazy bum/death and homelessness.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow. AP should find that video and flag whoever did that...deep, scary issues at play"

"<|emo_disgust|> Weird flex, but ok"
"<|emo_disgust|> My girlfriend's creepy uncle gets extremely triggered when I point this out, or that a lot of conservatives are gigantic fudds."
<|emo_anger|> You’re the one who is stupid

"<|emo_surprise|> Ohhhhh man, too real. I spent way too many years with full on raccoon eyes and just accepting that's what makeup was."
<|emo_fear|> Problem is that picture is there before you ever set foot in the cabin; [NAME] put it there. Just makes it creepy.
<|emo_sad|> Bless you this post made me cry
<|emo_anger|> Fuck isn't it nice to have a [NAME] on the team?
<|emo_fear|> Doesnt mean it's scary for everyone. I've taken it twice and have had zero symptoms.
<|emo_joy|> This one is hitting people that knew him hard. He was such a happy guy all the time. Hopefully they catch the bastard soon.
<|emo_disgust|> Tbf I don't think you can get much snakier than wishing for someone's pet to die

<|emo_joy|> I love how a few words can turn a post from believable bragging to complete bullshit.
<|emo_anger|> You should definitely stop using to meet men!
"<|emo_joy|> This is a huge stretch, but I would enjoy seeing some tweets from her hubby about it..."
<|emo_disgust|> Oh there's still bugs? Weird
<|emo_joy|> I threw my only book away so I could go catch Pokemon creatures
"<|emo_surprise|> I was shocked. They were talking earlier on the news about her losing by less than 100 being a victory, of sorts."
<|emo_sad|> Dude. Same. That would just be... Devastating.
<|emo_surprise|> *Hey just noticed..* it's your **8th Cakeday** [NAME]! ^(hug)
<|emo_anger|> Oy! NOW THAT'S REALLY PISSED IT OFF!!
<|emo_disgust|> Unhhh has not been funny for a while now. This is definitely a terrible idea.
"<|emo_joy|> Oh cool, the new sign is up :) "
<|emo_fear|> Brooklyn-Boston playoffs would be the most toxic thing of all time. Only Sixers-Cs would be worse
"<|emo_anger|> No, but it changes the expectations that people have for you. You have so deliberately change who you are to play to your target audience."
"<|emo_sad|> Some disturbing thoughts, but I hope you’re in a better place now pal. "
<|emo_surprise|> I'm going to blow your fucking mind. I dip my Hawaiian pizza in ranch. Booooooooom.

"<|emo_joy|> The social cohesion after brexit is going to be super cool too, everyone with flags on the windows."
<|emo_anger|> Aww a homophone on top of everything else. No wonder you carry a gun. You’re a coward who’s afraid of the world.
"<|emo_fear|> I thought it described me perfectly well, almost scary accurate so I personally believe in it. At least for INTP."
<|emo_joy|> :o thats pretty good. Not what envision my boy [NAME] but I like this alot.
<|emo_surprise|> I fully expect the curse to hit with him blowing out both acl's while playing video games
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] royally fucked up that last rotation. Also did [NAME] even get a single kill with their specialists ?
"<|emo_surprise|> They are high pressure hoses, think about getting waterboarded."
<|emo_sad|> I get migraines too and I’m sooo tired the first two days of my period
<|emo_anger|> Because idiots in this sub care too much about what other people have on their screen? It only tells me that too many people on here are narcissists.
<|emo_anger|> Shut up [NAME] we’ve had enough of experts
<|emo_anger|> You’re an asshole.
<|emo_disgust|> Jurassic world fallen kingdom was awful after they left the island
<|emo_sad|> Sadly the same way know people who know people and being in public. Maybe an online game with chat like league or xbox

<|emo_anger|> If this is serious mate it’s not the kind of shit you should be posting on reddit
<|emo_disgust|> Damn this is dope
<|emo_disgust|> Chogochujang is a fuckin drug. I've convinced myself that I'll take a bottle to wherever I travel in case the food doesnt fit my taste
<|emo_disgust|> >It is tailored to your viewing history. That's fairly common knowledge nowadays isn't it? Weird thing for the comic to point out.
"<|emo_disgust|> I feel awful posting it, but I couldn’t not share :|"
"<|emo_sad|> This is a good change. I've heard too many sad stories on Tinder about this sort of thing, looking for a way out. "
<|emo_disgust|> Women don't want their own shit. They want our shit. ---- [NAME]
<|emo_sad|> Sorry to hear about that and hope you have moved on.
<|emo_anger|> What a masterful bit of propaganda. Get the left to want war and criticize peace.
<|emo_anger|> Self-deprecating humor is mainstream now. A lot of hot people now have hobbies and personality traits that were once almost synonymous with dumpy/nerdy/ugly people.
"<|emo_anger|> ""Talk about vaccines again and your next shot will be from my gun... of crystals bathed in essential oils"""
<|emo_joy|> Happy cake day man!!!
"<|emo_sad|> My husband’s mental health issues caused our divorce. If you need a friend or a listening ear, pm me. I hope things improve!"
<|emo_anger|> spit on them when they do it
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME] has been attacking the basket a lot this game,good to see."

"<|emo_disgust|> You poor, hideous creature. "
<|emo_anger|> What the hell- they're paying for cars they don't and won't ever own?!
"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah I was super surprised by how good Trench was, probably my top album from last year"
<|emo_disgust|> is there a wikihow for that? edit: [of fucking course there is]
<|emo_joy|> I like the way your brain works OP. Always did enjoy bugs bunny humour.
<|emo_disgust|> This is a toxic behaviour.. get rid of him as soon as possible.
<|emo_sad|> Sadly there's a good chance that you still need a car anyway because that affordable neighborhood will involve a one hour commute.
<|emo_sad|> My whole life’s been a lie
<|emo_joy|> I'm happy to go without but if it's readily available then everyday.
"<|emo_anger|> She sounds abusive and narcissistic. Delete your facebook, hit the gym and kill her. "
<|emo_surprise|> after that we had no sustained damage for the fight so [NAME] and [NAME] just killed [NAME]
<|emo_joy|> So happy for your strong stance and to help him on his way out of your life.
"<|emo_anger|> That's absurd, people commit crimes blacked out on drugs/alcohol all the time. Also, they could just claim they don't remember it either way. "
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] THAT HURTS DON'T DO THAT
<|emo_sad|> And..the reality of it hurts
<|emo_anger|> 2016 was also the worst year of my life
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, not exactly a complimentary typo. "
<|emo_sad|> That last panel tho. :( Same dude.
<|emo_joy|> I just enjoy feasting off tears ....mmmmm
"<|emo_sad|> That sucks man, I'm sorry. Things will get better, they always do in the end"
<|emo_surprise|> wow - resonates with me.
<|emo_disgust|> Its weird because I didn’t say “house cat” I just said “cat” yet you felt the need to correct me.
<|emo_disgust|> Well I mean this game is so stupid in a lot of ways tbh
<|emo_sad|> It's also cruel how noone is informed about the execution at all. Relatives are left completely in the dark and likely never find out about their execution.
"<|emo_surprise|> I have never seen [NAME] playing like this! (only started watching this season, not sure about last one)"
<|emo_disgust|> Hahahah this is one of the dumbest thing i ever heard. Thank you for sharing and giving me a good laugh
"<|emo_disgust|> My nipples are rock hard right now, just ruined my shirt. "
"<|emo_disgust|> Yes, this is karma farming and it is disgusting to do that, BUT the title *could* be correct. It probably is made up though. "
<|emo_sad|> Hey now I didn't flunk out of med school to be insulted like this!
<|emo_disgust|> Bad luck you’re in Beckton
<|emo_joy|> I feel bad for laughing at this now that the creator of Spongebob passed away a month ago.
"<|emo_joy|> Welcome to the party, pal!"
<|emo_surprise|> Wack. Oh heard some 17 year olds are doing it too.
"<|emo_anger|> Fly, you fool!"
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] should have come back. I'm surprised you could get any worse than the s10 one but shit i was wrong.
<|emo_surprise|> In shock and was more concerned about my kid tbh. Now off course I wish I'd sued the arse off her for emotional distress.
<|emo_anger|> Why the fuck does this exist
<|emo_joy|> Ohhhhh yeah.
<|emo_sad|> I'm the same. I prefer sad depressed dudes and idk why. I know I like taking care of people though..
<|emo_sad|> I’m currently doing a 3 day fast and omg this is not helping 🤤
<|emo_fear|> that looks like a nightmare.
"<|emo_joy|> Ooh, the pupil proportion was wonderful at this time."
<|emo_fear|> It happens way more than you think. People are repulsive.
<|emo_anger|> Gungrabbers? You act like they're busting in your door and taking your guns. No one is forcing you to do this.
<|emo_anger|> People need to stop excusing bad behavior
<|emo_fear|> Sounds like you have a great doctor. Most are scared to give you any sort of advice like that.
"<|emo_joy|> Seconded. I had the December one well into January and finally just changed to the Sabres logo. Still cool and all, but the schedules were awesome."
"<|emo_joy|> Funny, I don't know a single MRA who's been accused of sexual assault... but I know plenty of feminists who have..."
<|emo_joy|> Happy B'day for Thursday!
<|emo_surprise|> I find it really strange how people align themselves with or against a politician so strongly.
<|emo_sad|> At least they don’t say that at a funeral
<|emo_surprise|> It’s like she’s forcing a fake British accent it’s so strange
"<|emo_joy|> I meant that you're funny, not that you've got a weird life"
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] was injured going into that game and then ultimately left in the second half after suffering another injury
<|emo_joy|> I like it better this way!
<|emo_sad|> I'm so sorry. Read about you getting kicked out at home. That must be devastating
<|emo_joy|> Happy new years!!!!
<|emo_anger|> It can make me angry - that and hearing my neighbors have sex
"<|emo_disgust|> Ouch, that looks horrible. Tagged his leg on the dumpster. Lucky he didn’t lose a leg going that fast."
<|emo_sad|> Cried when [NAME] and [NAME] gave each other a big hug and [NAME] lifted him off the ground.
<|emo_anger|> You fool! Now look what you've unleashed!
<|emo_anger|> Just made it! ‘03! StOp GrOuPiNg Me In WiTh ThE tIdE pOd GeNeRaTiOn!
"<|emo_anger|> Yes, when I need to get my jush, it’s freaking epic."
"<|emo_anger|> This is a test, now YOU have to give away that gold. Your donor was a cruel benefactor. "
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I don’t think [NAME] wants you to fuck my wife/his girlfriend anymore you cuck
<|emo_surprise|> I think [NAME] is a crisis actor!
"<|emo_joy|> Gotta love the ""its a metaphor"" guy, who has apparently never read any other comments by [NAME]"
<|emo_joy|> I’m an NA boy and Rival/Dig were my two favorite orgs. Glad to see at least one of them is returning.
"<|emo_anger|> ""I have been abusive."" This was before I even realised his narcissistic characteristics. "
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad you had such a positive experience on the sub and congrats on the relationship.
<|emo_fear|> So edgy.
<|emo_anger|> Yeah I don't think [NAME] even had to move his hands for that one. [NAME] and [NAME] also destroyed the precision QB challenge too.
<|emo_disgust|> I wished my mom protected me from my grandma. She was a horrible person who was so mean to me and my mom.
<|emo_anger|> Someone who's done very little to earn your ire. Did I piss in your cornflakes?
<|emo_sad|> Wow. Yeah does your place autograt at 8 or more ? So sorry 😐
<|emo_anger|> That’s part of why I hate porn so much - other than the exploitation of women
"<|emo_joy|> Cheers to that, girl. 🥂 "
<|emo_sad|> That...felt good...can I cry on your shoulder?
<|emo_fear|> I’m worried about [NAME] too
"<|emo_joy|> I’ve never been in love, haha. So I wouldn’t know.. thank you for this comment :)"
<|emo_joy|> I'm elated to hear that 🤗
<|emo_surprise|> Omg I just finished and I'm in awe...
<|emo_joy|> well i’m proud of you and that’s awesome
<|emo_sad|> Please don't.
"<|emo_anger|> Did you just assume my networth? Fucking pleb, I'll have you in the salt mines shining boots."

<|emo_fear|> Pls not granny :(
<|emo_anger|> If he doesn’t give it a ten I’m gonna riot
<|emo_anger|> Slave labor because the wage savings will be more money to bribe FIFA !
<|emo_surprise|> I had no idea! The art style just seemed similar to me. Looks like I’ve got a new show to watch.
<|emo_anger|> What I know is you seem perfectly comfortable being a hypocrite but utterly outraged at the idea of admitting to it.
<|emo_sad|> >The quality of medical care seems absolutely terrible as well. I've only been to a local hospital once Ok.
<|emo_surprise|> It’s deeply bizarre.
<|emo_anger|> Those fingers disturb me the most
"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], what? That's pretty hilarious and disgusting. "
<|emo_anger|> Brutal piece!
<|emo_sad|> Actually there are some terminals now that let you disable it lmao. Very sad.
"<|emo_anger|> Found the guy who has no idea what's going on! Downvote me all you want, you'll never take my memes!"
<|emo_disgust|> I cant’t stand mint flavored toothpaste. That’s how much I hate mint.
"<|emo_sad|> I remember that. It was a crushing experience that started a whole other level of depression. But hey, maybe things will work out for you. "
<|emo_sad|> Annihilate the furry and bring honor to my house.
"<|emo_sad|> [NAME] is so rational, I’d just cry really hard if my parents spent all my college money 💰 "
<|emo_surprise|> i didn't knew your toe can get that flat without breaking the nail in thousand of pieces
<|emo_surprise|> You have a long and amazing life ahead of you...you're beautiful 💜
"<|emo_anger|> I’d choose the kind amateur over the ignorant flamer any day, no matter what rank are they."
<|emo_disgust|> I can guarantee you for many the hate for this administration started much before the election results were in.
<|emo_joy|> Happy cakeday your username is fun
<|emo_joy|> This is actually funny
<|emo_surprise|> Read in the news yesterday that 3.6 million have lost their insurance since the rump took office. I wonder how many of them died because of it?
<|emo_sad|> Not happy.
<|emo_surprise|> I'm so doing this!
<|emo_disgust|> You came here to cry
<|emo_anger|> I hate how much I love it
<|emo_disgust|> It's ephemeral. It deteriorates in quality from the second you finish pouring. It isn't going to be framed. Enjoy the moment.
"<|emo_sad|> Oh I get it, you are illiterate on purpose because you fear to be fed with lies (in your mind). Sorry for you."
<|emo_surprise|> WOW HOLY SHIT
"<|emo_fear|> Yeah, for sure. I've definitely come pretty close to panic attacks at the dentist as well."

"<|emo_anger|> Who the hell thought he was dead, seriously."
<|emo_sad|> His left hand is mightily fucked.
"<|emo_surprise|> When he said, ""IT'S CALLED RESPECT"" and gritted through his teeth-- wow, he is just waiting to let his hands fly."
"<|emo_anger|> she seem immature, playing mind games. I would be direct and if she still keeps playing games let her go. seems like an attention seeker."
<|emo_anger|> Yeah that last one made me hate her the most for some reason.
"<|emo_joy|> No problem, glad to help."
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, hearing him swear, thats gonna be something "

"<|emo_sad|> GOOD [NAME] ALIGHTY, HE'S BROKEN IN HALF"
<|emo_anger|> It's shameful that he has to preface this post with his bias. Couldn't just leave well enough alone.
<|emo_surprise|> Time flies when you're a semiprofessional quotemaker. I wonder what he's up to these days.
<|emo_anger|> He sexually assaulted you. Notify the police and the staff!
"<|emo_anger|> Yep, first hour free at long term. But if you go a SECOND over that you owe them $19.80 ! They're fucking ruthless"
"<|emo_joy|> So happy to see [NAME] regaining his form... we had to sacrifice [NAME] for it, but i’m okay with that..."
<|emo_joy|> I love [NAME] but he seems to enjoy deleting his videos after a while :(
<|emo_fear|> Oh no you got us Feminism canceled Pack it up y'all
<|emo_surprise|> It’s amazing how the r/synthwave sub is just endless remixes of this poster. And the LEGO Movie 2 poster is too.

"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] 31m contract is horrendous, I hated it when he signed it and I hate it now."
<|emo_sad|> I did that in origins but now that theres mercenaries and its sooo annoying to deal with them so i stay as quiet as i can until im caught.
<|emo_disgust|> Jurassic world fallen kingdom was awful after they left the island
<|emo_surprise|> That's crazy; I went to a super [RELIGION] high school and I think I can remember 2 girls the entire 4 years that became teen moms.
<|emo_surprise|> I love this post. Are you with park services?
<|emo_joy|> Love reading these kind of posts! So happy for you.

"<|emo_sad|> Well, that's mean :'("
"<|emo_fear|> I'd say the bigger potential problem is getting reported for public indecency, that goes on your criminal record."
"<|emo_joy|> Seriously, you wanna give me singles? Awesome. I don't have to ask management AGAIN for more ones. XD "
<|emo_disgust|> What a nasty goal! Gives you chills!
<|emo_joy|> You're* Stay in school lol
<|emo_fear|> It just never got weird enough..
<|emo_sad|> They blew up my feelings :'(
"<|emo_sad|> It was a painful cringe, too. Are we masochists?"
<|emo_joy|> Enjoying Mummers. I'm from Philly. I kind of terrified as they just used Skyrim music....
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry if I was insulting, I just took your post as some commie type smugly trolling how stupid [NAME] is "
"<|emo_sad|> i know there were talks about it, but its doubtful :( "
<|emo_anger|> We don't deserve sex with dogs.
<|emo_disgust|> Makes me want to go shit on the doorstep of 540 Hampshire Street (Good2go HQ)
<|emo_surprise|> Oh no! More non-existent performance issues to complain about!! Can't wait to be playing it while all these self-righteous gamers take their noble stands...
<|emo_sad|> Topic change #4. This is getting sad.
<|emo_disgust|> Worst feeling ever
<|emo_joy|> I want to hug both of them.
<|emo_sad|> *cries in south america*
"<|emo_anger|> Watch out, [NAME]!! [NAME] is right behind you. Oh god oh fuck he can’t hear us, he has AirPods."
<|emo_joy|> Talked about our demons after watching It's Kind of a Funny Story.
<|emo_sad|> Tell her off yourself (and poke her in the back) that she's way too old and way too heavy to be pulling this stuff.
<|emo_anger|> That’s just cruel and unusual. Hook him up for aggravated assault on a police officer.
<|emo_anger|> Holy hell I hate them so much.
<|emo_joy|> This was literally the first examole that came to mind for me hahaha
"<|emo_sad|> I go to a neighborhood mexican restaurant monthly for the past 2.5 years, but nobody knows my name ☹"
"<|emo_fear|> yeah, there's even more registered online. scary."
"<|emo_joy|> That’s kind of what makes the “guest” response funny, how did it get there?"
<|emo_joy|> Glad I could help but it's not mine. I'm just passing it on.
<|emo_disgust|> Having sex with a child in the room is often difficult and boring.
<|emo_fear|> Thought i was already there with the terrible title.
<|emo_sad|> I am trying they try to say I’m fake even though I’m trying it’s painful to talk to them sometimes
<|emo_surprise|> Wow [NAME] has a lot more insecurities than I thought
<|emo_joy|> And it was out of their control as well for both. That's funny
<|emo_fear|> That’s horrible. I’m probably going to donate to them I can’t imagine not missing out on a season because someone stole.
<|emo_sad|> kind of funny considering that the fentanyl that is killing people in North America - Canada and USA - comes from China.
"<|emo_surprise|> I am so thrilled that you broke through that constraining ceiling, or that ""tunnel vision""."
"<|emo_joy|> Hey, that's awesome. I'll be sure to think of some questions for you in the future."
<|emo_surprise|> Man I jave never heard such a load of horseshit.
<|emo_sad|> Nope. Sadly early 30s
<|emo_anger|> i feel like they are hateful towards everyone but that might be me not understanding their community
"<|emo_surprise|> I fucking change my mind, something wonderful has happened! Please don't make me go dead, tomorrow."
"<|emo_fear|> Pls no, it's too cold outside to go hatless."
<|emo_anger|> Also makes you a lot more likely to repeat mistakes.
<|emo_sad|> How many gallons do we need is my favorite so far. The sad part is that it was always pleasant.
<|emo_sad|> Hey leave me and my 11 year old Thai wife out of this.
"<|emo_anger|>  ""If you don't wear BROWN AND ORANGE...YOU DON'T MATTER!"" We need a tshirt with that on it asap! "
<|emo_sad|> Sorry I failed to mention I'm relatively new to the scene . Last 2 years only
"<|emo_joy|> This is most excellent news! Also, glad to know he went on to work somewhere like Google."

"<|emo_sad|> Guys help I can’t stop playing it, my hands are in so much pain!"
<|emo_joy|> Lol well now you have even more in common! So happy to help and hope you can smile a bit before you zzzzzzz. :-)
"<|emo_anger|> That goes both ways, their adrenaline and determination would also be through the fucking roof."
"<|emo_sad|> I am truly sorry, I did not realise you thought immigration had no bearing on brexit. I shall not overestimate your intellectual abilities in future, i promise."
<|emo_joy|> Love seeing the guys have fun.
"<|emo_anger|> Wow, that really hurts coming from a demented troll sockpuppets brigading me on this sub"
<|emo_joy|> I like how they roll
"<|emo_anger|> Yeah it is, I hate it so much, I wish I woke up earlier."
<|emo_anger|> What the hell is going on at Getty Images?
<|emo_anger|> hey that's my weather give it back -- a north dakota redditor
"<|emo_sad|> >For those of us who stay, there may be more unhappiness than happiness. Probably the saddest thing I ever heard. "
"<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I'm glad [NAME] doing better, but he might have serious trust issues for life. "
<|emo_disgust|> Dear lord this woman is awful
<|emo_joy|> Unless you have actual ADHD lol. But I think this was mostly meant to be funny
<|emo_fear|> Oh my gosh! That light house!! Its terrifying!!
"<|emo_disgust|> Ugh, so misleading, and such a disappointment for those of us whose skin is the color of ACTUAL porcelain. "
<|emo_fear|> Gotta cheat on taxes somehow LOL
<|emo_joy|> the Browns called. They would be happy to help you end your career
"<|emo_joy|> Ooh, that's interesting info actually (*heads to capfriendly to check how many years until [NAME] is a UFA*)"
<|emo_anger|> I do the 4-second gap as well and is it infuriating to see someone take advantage of it.
"<|emo_anger|> I might be a prude. ""Suck him off in the bathroom of your friend's home!"" Those don't equate"
<|emo_surprise|> Damn that coyote was a fucking noob.
"<|emo_sad|> I walked 500 miles and then I walked 500 more, you can’t relate to my pain 😤"
<|emo_joy|> My sister did Blue Apron and loved it.
<|emo_anger|> Damn. [NAME]
<|emo_fear|> That's what worries me the most - the exposed glans. Is there anything you can recommend so I can prepare myself for underwear etc?
<|emo_anger|> I knoooow like why do people exist just to make things worse I’m so tired of all these alts/ weird question askers
"<|emo_anger|> Thats just dumb, u are stealing from people that just want to live a good life cuz other were unlucky, they were also unlucky by being born."
<|emo_anger|> > I want to feel peace and not have to wake up everyday anxious for what the day has in store. I can relate to this.
"<|emo_fear|> Once they saw the purple hair dye go into the Amazon cart, they got real scared. "
"<|emo_anger|> Holy fuck dude. Use the mute button. Your feelings were hurt with one message, now click it, thanks ^_^"
"<|emo_joy|> Someone really needs to solve the problem of how to put cars into video games, I'd love to see it one day, just imagine the fun!"
<|emo_anger|> Get out now!
<|emo_surprise|> What? No angelic BROWN EFFIN COW????
<|emo_joy|> that sounds absolutely adorable!! im glad you had those kittens there as a distraction :)
<|emo_sad|> I feel for the dad curled up at the end of the bed like a loyal dog
<|emo_joy|> Oh well... I'll like both of you.
<|emo_anger|> Your meme is bad and you should feel bad
<|emo_joy|> One week sounds like a good timeframe. Good luck on your channel! I hope that expected revenue goes up for you.
<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting. And not one parent thought that was a *bit* inappropriate? smh
<|emo_sad|> Oh my gosh!!!!!! 😂 you poor thing! Thanks for sharing!
<|emo_joy|> Good manager had your back. That lady just wanted free gift wrapping
<|emo_disgust|> The guy is seriously neurotic.
<|emo_sad|> Even in the offseason we can’t escape the injury bug :/
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] your desk is fucked.
"<|emo_anger|> for how long, you arent fucking with me?"
<|emo_surprise|> Smoooootthhhhhhh!!
<|emo_sad|> I'm so sorry that [NAME] has convinced you that his insane aggression isn't important.
<|emo_anger|> Russian prostitutes are overblown. It's not even that common. There isn't really any widespread negative perceptions about [NAME] in South Korea.
<|emo_anger|> Fucking fuck! 2 (or more) sets of fucking socks in fucking sandals.
<|emo_joy|> Luckiest I’ve been is getting the toy I actually wanted from a McDonald’s happy meal.
<|emo_fear|> I got a bad feeling about this. Something tells me they're going to drag this along until 2 weeks before release.
"<|emo_sad|> This, in top of my already terrible mental health, is the reason why I'm severely underweight and need help."
<|emo_surprise|> wow I think you've really got her now
<|emo_sad|> Same. Even while not on my period I have lower back pain
"<|emo_joy|> Good to know, and it gladdens my heart to hear you're all right! <3 "
"<|emo_sad|> That used to be my favorite view on the planet, but now it’s just rage. I can’t look anymore."
<|emo_surprise|> Suddenly went 6 to midnight TBH
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] would be really pissed off to lose c3po and r2 to the fucking destroy ending
<|emo_joy|> Hahaha ;)
<|emo_surprise|> I find this sooooo strange
<|emo_sad|> Very good post brother you hit the nail on the head. It is unfortunate that people downvote this post to the bottom when you explain so well.
<|emo_fear|> That’s scary
<|emo_surprise|> Omg!!! just saw an interview of her! Wow this [NAME] is a horrible mother!!! Oh my Gooood! 😱
<|emo_disgust|> The scorpion one on the swing set looked so bad. I think I heard her back break/crack.
<|emo_sad|> That’s unfortunate
<|emo_fear|> This was potentially the most dangerous stunt I have ever seen someone do. One minor mistake and you die.
"<|emo_anger|> It would be mostly home-grown terrorism, angry at all the people fleeing from overseas terrorism."
"<|emo_fear|> Watched it last night and as someone not generally into supernatural horror/thriller type stuff, I thought it was pretty damn enjoyable. "
"<|emo_surprise|> That's true, but I was surprised to find absolutely ZERO information about a person who , presumably, has quite a bit of power and influence."
<|emo_joy|> Isn't the minimum 3 majors or something? I don't think he made the cut but I'd be happy to be proven wrong
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME]: ""WTF, it's just a prank bro!"""
<|emo_sad|> Pure unconsitional love can also be dangerous: if the other person turns out to be an abuser you should propably stop loving them
"<|emo_anger|> He has actively lied about and misrepresented Canadian laws and legislation, even after he's been corrected. "
"<|emo_sad|> I was like you man, 3 felt so bad. But street part 4 3 becomes a so bad it's hilarious imo."
"<|emo_joy|> Man I remember playing street hockey at desert breeze growing up, good times"
<|emo_sad|> Yet I still feel lonely doing it...
"<|emo_anger|> Stop working, it works with the GM corporation, why not the US corporation. "
"<|emo_sad|> I don't know what else to do. I have no transportation, personal phone, or money. And I live in a rural area."
<|emo_joy|> You finally made a monkey out of me
<|emo_joy|> That might be an issue when it comes to meeting girls all the way around. Generally we love a guy who can make us laugh.
<|emo_disgust|> Noo this guy was parachuting down fromthe mount blanc to kill his self
<|emo_sad|> And still our government is not responsible enough to pay its bills. It's rather pathetic.
<|emo_surprise|> No dude! Don't you get it?! Women are like cats! /s
<|emo_anger|> Ive never done deadlifts. Are they worth getting into in terms of back hypertrophy? I already do rows and weighted pullups.
<|emo_surprise|> what a surprise i never saw coming
"<|emo_anger|> They played loud music on a ‘school night’, seriously! You’re backing the bastards here just to be contrary."
<|emo_joy|> Happy Cake Day [NAME]! Use what talents you possess: the woods would be very silent if no birds sang there except those that sang best.
<|emo_anger|> They were literally traitors to America
<|emo_disgust|> I feel bad for these guys. I'd like to be able to help ex-mos in trouble.
"<|emo_fear|> Welp. That sucks. I always check left and right when crossing an intersection, getting T-boned is one of my biggest fears."
"<|emo_anger|> Would breaking her jaw and hands be out of line? She couldn’t call or text, what a shame. "
<|emo_sad|> They got ripped apart here (On Reddit) a few weeks ago for passing false information on aircraft videos and taking legit criticism poorly.
"<|emo_disgust|> For real though, I do apologize. That's a bad run of luck for sure, it's such a rare syndrome "
<|emo_sad|> I miss the Scottish [NAME].
"<|emo_fear|> Now you're thinking, 'I hope that's shepherd's pie in my knickers!"
<|emo_surprise|> Unrelated but wow I’m so proud that I can read like 70-80 percent of this because I studied Chinese for 3 years. 加油！在中国你做什么？
<|emo_anger|> Stop arguing with people.
"<|emo_sad|> I find it sadly ironic that a man's job is to protect his family, yet if he's alone with his children they question their safety."
<|emo_joy|> Be happy because I won't be short anymore one day
<|emo_sad|> People would still always parry them (600ms) :(
"<|emo_sad|> I am really sorry for you, but oh my [NAME] this made me cry laughing. I hope the cat learns to like you eventually"
<|emo_disgust|> Mad stinky.
<|emo_surprise|> This was insane. I knew [NAME] was legit when he swung at a pitch while being intentionally walked and almost hit it out.
<|emo_anger|> > How can you hate your brother in arms? They managed a damn fine job of it in Weimar Germany.
<|emo_surprise|> And oops AND a yikes. Maybe even as much as an OOF. Definitely a wow from me
<|emo_anger|> Damn straight.
<|emo_anger|> >also seen a few snaps Bad pun...BAD!
<|emo_anger|> Fucking Instagram normies
"<|emo_surprise|> Really? I live down the street from there, thanks!!!"
<|emo_anger|> Yeeesss...... let the anger flow through you...
<|emo_anger|> Fuck your husband
<|emo_sad|> I feel personally attacked.
"<|emo_sad|> As someone who has been in a similar relationship, it is indeed emotional abuse."
"<|emo_sad|> I find that even when I wear a hat, I ""look [RELIGION]"" and get the same hate."
"<|emo_sad|> Same for me, feels like i've been made alone just so my brother can get all the attention"
<|emo_anger|> Wtf? Really?
<|emo_sad|> *nods* I know an unfortunate reality. I was presuming that he isn't in a situation like that based on what he said though.
<|emo_disgust|> I get ya. If thinness was something I could buy I'd be flat broke by now
"<|emo_sad|> This can’t be the end of the back, garbage TV! I’ll miss you!"
<|emo_anger|> I hate Twitter
<|emo_sad|> That poor mercy. Just died to die again xD
<|emo_sad|> It's just sad; she was just nice and normal before she messed with her looks
<|emo_fear|> Get help immediately.
<|emo_joy|> This makes me smile
"<|emo_fear|> It’s horrible for me, way worse than your situation. Be Glad that you aren’t me"
"<|emo_anger|> I mean that’s a stupid rule that creates an echo chamber, but I don’t see how that belongs here."
<|emo_disgust|> dont get how it was a bad episode. this sub really likes to nitpick i guess.
<|emo_surprise|> How dare they ask me to be a good person! I'll show em!
<|emo_surprise|> I didn’t know [NAME] disliked Pittsburgh so much
"<|emo_joy|> I played that one. It was really fun(at least to me, as a kid)."
<|emo_surprise|> Oh awesome! I didn't even notice your name until now lol
"<|emo_anger|> fucking melb transport. I knew it would go to shit today because of the heat wave, and it did. the only bad thing about this city."
<|emo_sad|> It is sad they didn't have a 4k highspeed camera running on this... I feel like the world lost an amazing possibility
<|emo_fear|> Please don’t murder me
"<|emo_anger|> DEAD DUCK INSIDE DO NOT EAT. Well, I’m not sure what I expected. "
"<|emo_fear|> Pretty good, but I would put the bishop on B4 so that the Knight will be in danger of the queen after taking the bishop."
<|emo_sad|> Reading this made me clutch my nipples in pain
<|emo_disgust|> I took Hawaii ML and even I'm clenching.... this is INSANE
<|emo_sad|> Which is why not only did PR lose but RUP was not the first choice sadly even if it had won in BC :(
<|emo_surprise|> That day was incredible.
"<|emo_joy|> I made my own sauce for chicken dishes this week, I am happy, LGD"
<|emo_joy|> Cool! Thanks for responding! ;)
<|emo_fear|> And here I thought it was just my phone... damn what a horrible site.
<|emo_anger|> I would change the episode with Icicle. Get rid of the cold puns. Everything else can stay the same
<|emo_sad|> Just life.. I feel like i'm just a parasite that should be removed.
<|emo_disgust|> I cannot help but get a sense of schadenfreude when a seemingly shitty person ruins their own career right before my eyes. ☕️
<|emo_sad|> this literally made me sick to my stomach
<|emo_sad|> *[NAME] playing the world's saddest tune on the world's biggest violin.*
<|emo_sad|> all the time :(
<|emo_sad|> I miss [NAME].
<|emo_joy|> Embrace the feels my friend. Glad you found happiness even if it is fleeting.
<|emo_disgust|> Oh I will be independent. I don't need someone like that in my life.
<|emo_anger|> What a REPOST! STOP REPOSTING THINGS PEOPLE LITERALLY JUST POSTED.
"<|emo_disgust|> I hate the message that's being pushed, and it's even worse that it's being pushed by this guy."
<|emo_anger|> Whoever wrote this article has no concept of what’s going on what so ever. There assessments are miles off the mark.
<|emo_surprise|> Except [NAME] had his brains blown out by a .50 cal bullet at point blank range.
<|emo_anger|> But milk is beta food! Who wants that girly ass shit from a boob? My child will drink bone broth and the tears of broken women!!
<|emo_surprise|> I didn't know [NAME] was in a j rock band
<|emo_sad|> I'm sad I had to come this far down to find this.
<|emo_anger|> Leave him alone!
"<|emo_sad|> Grey socks and leather sandals, that hurts me through the screen."
"<|emo_anger|> YEAH, YOU MOTHERFUCKER"
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] has weird ideas about everything.
"<|emo_disgust|> this makes liberals look like spoiled house cats, it's embarrassing honestly."
<|emo_sad|> Yeah but being happy at other misfortune is sowing bad karma for yourself.
<|emo_joy|> Me cheering for the Wild this year
"<|emo_disgust|> Oh good grief! Put it away, [NAME]."
<|emo_joy|> I once got flowers from a girl... idk why but it just feels good
"<|emo_joy|> Haha, actually grandpa did! Go figure "
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, the video is a lot worse than I thought. His actions after he asks for the age is very uncomfortable. "
"<|emo_sad|> >For those of us who stay, there may be more unhappiness than happiness. Probably the saddest thing I ever heard. "
<|emo_joy|> You SW folks and your fancy pubs.
<|emo_fear|> Thats awful and Im sorry for your friend. I whole heartedly agree. Its getting out of hand.
<|emo_anger|> >. Cinders not going to be there when [NAME] fights [NAME]. Shes getting the relic. [NAME] has the Relic.
"<|emo_surprise|> Just out of curiousity, how does 4:3 stretched look on a 21:9 monitor"
<|emo_sad|> His head bounced on the hardwood. Damn.
<|emo_sad|> I'm so broke that I'd take if you're still looking. I'm a guy though.
"<|emo_anger|> I actually see this one a lot. ""Allergy: fire ants."" Me too, bro. Ants will fuck you up."
<|emo_joy|> That last story was absolutely beautiful and sad.
<|emo_anger|> He hates the Falcon because his dad would leave him all the time on it as a kid
<|emo_joy|> I mean you can want a break from something and still enjoy it.
<|emo_anger|> assault some more people.
<|emo_disgust|> The worst is ‘get in a group with someone you don’t already know’
"<|emo_joy|> LOL thank you for this, it made me genuinely laugh. They're so weird"
<|emo_joy|> Interesting considering my tattoo looked like this when it was fresh
<|emo_anger|> * Fuck [NAME] * Yes
<|emo_joy|> They would call him a snowflake libcuck
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME] damn, that is the kind of biting commentary I enjoy."
"<|emo_joy|> Oh so it is a separate guy filming, it’s actually impressive how synced up their speeds are"
"<|emo_joy|> This feels more like ""Lofi Rock"" if that exists, or even Jazz. Very interesting."
<|emo_joy|> My favorite thing is his friend in the back
<|emo_surprise|> When he put his legs on either side of the crocodile I thought to myself “man you still have time to change your mind” but alas.
<|emo_disgust|> Bitch subscribed to 1st look at [NAME] shitposts.
<|emo_fear|> That's not even accounting for the NDAs other customers have had to sign.
<|emo_disgust|> I have even gotten to have sex with women who were fellow comics nerds and also hated what movies have done to [NAME] stories!
<|emo_joy|> Wow random irrelevant internet person has the secret goods on [NAME]. Maybe we’ll finally get to the bottom of this birth certificate thing...
<|emo_sad|> This is awful and borderline abuse. I can't imagine thinking that's even slightly okay
<|emo_joy|> Good luck to you! Cheers to a new year! 👍🏼
<|emo_disgust|> I’ve never heard of this before. That’s awful.
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, you are strong did you report him?"
<|emo_surprise|> BOOO THIS WAS RIGGED
"<|emo_surprise|> When *[NAME]* has to talk you out of an idea, you know you've got to rethink how you're living your life."
<|emo_fear|> Yuuuuuuuuuup. It's horrible.
"<|emo_surprise|> Aw jeez [NAME], we went from 2D to 2D..."
<|emo_fear|> It still seems dangerous
<|emo_surprise|> I worked at a hospital in northern NJ and float pool was only $4 extra
"<|emo_surprise|> ""almost"" and ""nagging"" not ""killed"" and ""forced"". Wow... When did roleplayers get so damn whinny. "
<|emo_sad|> Hmmmmm never thought about it like that
<|emo_joy|> And I'm happy we all agree it's deathcore.
"<|emo_sad|> Take it easy, hater. He nailed it."
<|emo_surprise|> Dude couldn’t see he had a spool of hair growing on his face?!
"<|emo_joy|> Hi, [NAME]! I hope you have the best day ever! -HappyFriendlyBot"
<|emo_disgust|> That is extremely uncomfortable to look at.
"<|emo_anger|> As someone who has polluted their body with copious amounts of sugar, I somewhat doubt steroids are any worse. Abuse anything and it will hurt you."
"<|emo_joy|> Wow, someones lived a sheltered life."
<|emo_joy|> The line the reviews were not positive made me laugh for some reason.
<|emo_joy|> I do enjoy my lawn. 😁
"<|emo_disgust|> Disguising your feelings behind humor is not really a unique coping strategy, isn't it? "
<|emo_disgust|> This is his worst season since his rookie year
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] it’s ok the trumpet player can’t hurt you anymore
"<|emo_sad|> I’ve gone through it before, and it sucks. I’m still a little hazy and withdrawn."
<|emo_joy|> Happy birthday [NAME]!
<|emo_joy|> No problem! I’m glad we can help. Hope it goes well
<|emo_surprise|> I don’t know anybody of 22 who gets 10 hours of sleep every night
<|emo_joy|> You dropped a ‘want’ in that last sentence my dude
"<|emo_surprise|> The summer of love, hippie, anarchy communism thing kind of fell apart here: "
"<|emo_sad|> Actually made me feel worse. Kids are always back there, death would have been guaranteed had they any."
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is lactose intolerant, so when it comes to milk he likes to drink soythress"
"<|emo_sad|> [NAME]? Yeah, that one hurts."
"<|emo_joy|> Forehead kisses, and any of the cute nicknames he calls me [NAME], best feeling being in his arms [NAME] I miss it all"
"<|emo_joy|> Thanks so much for the precious advice, that is very helpful!"
"<|emo_fear|> Which is why he's still in the league as a red zone threat, but the days of 1,300 yards 12 TDs are long gone."
"<|emo_fear|> My problem was that Flashpoint ended in 1 episode, when it could've been an entire arc"
<|emo_fear|> Probably scared they’re gonna get flashed by a camera.
<|emo_disgust|> Fair. Actually fuck the last few songs on Bleach.
"<|emo_anger|> How stupid are you, if you dont réalize it’s staged "
<|emo_sad|> I never used the word mean. Chill. I said weak and it is. Its sad aswell.
<|emo_joy|> Fuck I love you prag
<|emo_disgust|> > Every billionaire is a policy failure Damn right!
"<|emo_fear|> I had a nightmare about something similar, the combination of high walls and water is truly scary"
<|emo_joy|> I can’t wait to try the cleric class again!
<|emo_fear|> Guns go off accidentally all the time. Don’t point them at someone unless you plan to kill them.
<|emo_anger|> What country? That sounds like a sad septic system. I'm sorry.
<|emo_surprise|> I’m surprised by how quickly they were able to get a graphic for Kent.
<|emo_joy|> So did mine! And I'm now one myself. Sending a trillion hugs and props to you!
<|emo_anger|> Fuck this gif
"<|emo_disgust|> It looked sarcastic, you're not in the wrong"
<|emo_surprise|> That’s absolutely fantastic but I literally was only pointing out the last time I can remember Connecticut being in the national spotlight.
"<|emo_surprise|> You too! (FYI I accidentally initially replied in a new comment, in case you didn’t see my other reply)"
"<|emo_fear|> Your imaginary boyfriend is kinda creepy. Although, if he's kinky then he may be for keeps. *wink "
"<|emo_joy|> My fiancé and I went to a friends house and just hung out until midnight and watched fireworks, it was so chill and perfect!"
<|emo_joy|> I always do this. They get closer or just move to another lane lol
<|emo_joy|> She’s actually crazy
<|emo_anger|> Damn... this weed is the shiznittlebamsnipsnapsack!
<|emo_anger|> Of all the injustices in the world!
<|emo_disgust|> Dirty secret. They retired the decks until they got a doozy.
<|emo_disgust|> Fuck shit bitch
<|emo_fear|> All of their Saints are psychotic idiot who died for nothing. People remember them as horrible people in death as they were in life.
<|emo_joy|> I skipped the Oilers game for a birthday party for a cat. I’m glad I did that instead.
"<|emo_anger|> Ya know, I hate lying but I guess I'd make an exception for this. "
"<|emo_fear|> We are on the brink, you won't wait long."
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] BREAK THE GAME. WHY HAVE YOU GIVEN ALL THE KILLERS A FUCKTON OF THEM. ITS SO DAMN STUPID.
<|emo_anger|> Technically it’s the abdomen. Stomach and belly are just informal synonyms. That girl is a racist and an idiot.
"<|emo_fear|> Even though it should level out, it's still currently having major detrimental impacts on the environment and human suffering "
<|emo_sad|> ROI for that is too low. Truth is customers are willing to put up with shitty employees.
<|emo_fear|> Ireland because Ireland. Not me but i did something pretty scary.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow that was a roasting... Deserved, but daaaaamn [NAME]"
"<|emo_anger|> Even if you don't act on them, you still should stay away. It's not normal to fantasize about doing sexual things to children."
"<|emo_anger|> Holy fuck that stop, good shit [NAME]"
"<|emo_joy|> Oh, hey what's up dude? Haven't seen you around in a while bro. Glad to see your still here."
<|emo_sad|> Lip injections only cost $700 and I saved up for months. But I’m broke currently
<|emo_joy|> Oh hey that's pretty cool!
<|emo_joy|> Tuck her in and give her a kiss on the forehead

<|emo_anger|> I would smash both
"<|emo_disgust|> Well, I'm glad you're out of all that now. How awful. The way they act, they make you think healthy boundaries are you being hostile."
<|emo_joy|> Sad to see this as a one-off. [NAME] seemed to be really enjoy the game and itself. Will give the game a try.

<|emo_anger|> I absolutely hate the guy. Can't stand him. But we live in country with laws and he broke none. I think lynch mobs are more gross
<|emo_joy|> Im almost done with season 7 now. This show ans the office were probably my two all time favorite shows.
<|emo_sad|> In that case... Happy Amnesia Day!
<|emo_sad|> Rainy weather must have gotten them... no idea. But i've never seen a dead hummingbird and saw 2 within 5 feet of each other :(

<|emo_joy|> I enjoyed that [NAME] kept saying [NAME] last name wrong over and over.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow interesting to hear how the cops responded. Glad they actually tracked the car down!
<|emo_surprise|> Is this because of the sudden spate of comments feeling shocked that we don't respect proud right leaners or have you always had these mails?

<|emo_disgust|> oh gosh i heard about that and though it was absolutely disgusting
<|emo_sad|> That is utterly horrifying. I'm so sorry that your kindergarten teacher was such a heartless old bat.

<|emo_joy|> Enjoy
<|emo_anger|> Yes girl! Get it!! Nothing better than an impromptu meet!! Rude the high!
<|emo_fear|> Same thing happened to me last year ended horribly
<|emo_sad|> I wanna die!
<|emo_sad|> I genuinely teared up when I heard it in the game

"<|emo_anger|> What she is doing is child abuse, plain and simple. Fight with everything you have to protect your kids. "

<|emo_joy|> Yay! Nice work everyone. I love reddit.

<|emo_anger|> aww hell no. This fucking ad

<|emo_anger|> Wtf are you taking about? What does that have to do wi- *checks post history* **OH**
<|emo_joy|> I enjoyed watching the crazy old man being dragged out at the end.
<|emo_anger|> Any man who risks having unprotected intercourse with random women likely doesn't have being a father on his mind.
"<|emo_joy|> I'm glad you can relate. I'm glad in a really alienated, empty way. But glad, still. Probably."

<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] was a pleasant surprise. It might be something you'll enjoy.
<|emo_joy|> What a great photo and you two look so happy. 😍
<|emo_sad|> Constantly worrying about her and not feeling pleasure without her presence could be. You need to talk to a therapist.

<|emo_joy|> This gives me life
"<|emo_anger|> No it’s not, I can give you multiple examples of cops getting physically assaulted and not even using their guns. Stop lying."

<|emo_joy|> These questions tell you'll be a fantastic dad! Don't sweat it too much and make sure you enjoy it. They grow up quick :)
"<|emo_joy|> This is fantastic! What an incredible gesture. Given the current fears British [NAME] are currently living under, this is a very welcome bit of news."
"<|emo_disgust|> The truly great thing about this is how he looks down, disgusted, as if the comment were down there 😂"
"<|emo_surprise|> Dang, dawg. That one shocked me "
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] will be proud of people who share links from conspiracy websites in order to “defend” him. Hahahahaha
<|emo_joy|> Ah the high life. Must be sweet.

"<|emo_anger|> Dude, its **life** it's not **trauma**. Grow up "
<|emo_anger|> - But mom! I don’t wanna go to school today! - You’re going little shit.

<|emo_anger|> Worst dad ever!
"<|emo_joy|> Yo where they at, I want to celebrate with them."

"<|emo_anger|> Fact: violins don't make music. And if you think they do, you're stupid. "
<|emo_disgust|> Not ok. They could have easily given them a drug test if they really wanted to know if they were on drugs. Disgusting.
<|emo_joy|> I can when enough time has passed. I've got each of their playoff games from that year and it's fun to relive it during the offseason.
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] made me like a sleep walker.. I did things I didn't remember doing. Scary.
<|emo_surprise|> Does this really work? Any one else try this yet? I'm surprised I've never heard of this before thank you.
<|emo_sad|> One wonders just how awful [NAME] and [NAME] have to be before people will believe it.
"<|emo_disgust|> fuck these dysfunctional, insecure mattresses"
"<|emo_fear|> That sounds terrible! I get hay fever some years, I also have eczema and anxiety, all at once sounds like pure hell."
"<|emo_disgust|> Man, dropping is rather dreadful but nothing’s more dreadful when you can reach into your pockets expecting it to be there and it isn’t "
<|emo_sad|> and [NAME] got blessed with a LocationBot cat fact?! There is no justice in the world...
"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, I don't think [NAME] supporters should use intelligence as a reason to talk down to people. I have watched [NAME] speak. Yikes."
"<|emo_anger|> Such a sad, angry person. Take a break from reddit and go take up cycling or something."
<|emo_surprise|> Between this and the headline it makes me wonder how he fits his ego through most doorways.
<|emo_surprise|> This is not a comedy subreddit. It is a subreddit about the unexpected.
<|emo_fear|> You badly need to do more research than just a few good operations. There are a lot of terrible ones.
<|emo_joy|> I love when you get the text afterwards - my last donation apparently saved a life in Cairns! Really cheered me up actually.
<|emo_disgust|> It's a shitty made shirt but if it was done well I'd wear it.
<|emo_joy|> This is awesome!
<|emo_fear|> It's seriously terrifying!
<|emo_joy|> You are welcome! Love to you on the journey!
<|emo_disgust|> Is it against the Geneva convention to plant your enemies land with nasty cultureless bigots? It definitely should be.
<|emo_disgust|> A cheater is always a cheater in my book.
<|emo_joy|> I would pay good money to watch [NAME] vs Dr. Now!!!
<|emo_disgust|> I’M HOT ALL THE TIME :( pre-pregnancy I was cold a lot. This is worse.
<|emo_anger|> What the heck? $3 a month for 30 texts? That's ridiculous.
<|emo_anger|> Can't stand having sex with you...?? Just horrible thing to say... You deserve better!!!
"<|emo_joy|> But, it entertains you.... in some way. Thats the point dude."
<|emo_sad|> Pls end me
<|emo_anger|> “My- my god I- it is time for me to bear children.”
<|emo_sad|> I feel bad for my kids who will never get to see [NAME] play... [NAME] on the other hand...
<|emo_surprise|> Oh nice I was wondering if you could mix flavours. I'll still stick to mint though 🤷‍♂️
"<|emo_surprise|> Here did you know that [NAME] slept with 35,000 women. Outrageous."
"<|emo_fear|> Thank you very much. I try my best to follow my steps from therapy, but it seems to be my biggest hurdle."
<|emo_fear|> Wow! It's dead af here
<|emo_surprise|> we stan supportive parents!
<|emo_disgust|> It's a shame when a really attractive person does this to themself. Pretty eyes great smile.
"<|emo_fear|> I was so scared, I thought the kid was going to backpedal into a street."

"<|emo_sad|> You see benevolent, I see cynical and morally bankrupt."
<|emo_surprise|> Your mental gymnastics are absolutely astounding

<|emo_surprise|> who doesn’t know what an Ethernet port looks like lmao
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow im glad my uncle is dead , this sounds crazy ."

<|emo_disgust|> >Her obsession with “her man” is weird as shit though. He's jealous. He still cares about [NAME].
<|emo_fear|> I cannot imagine being so fragile that being able to smile threatens your identity and world view.
<|emo_fear|> Yeah it’s the opponents club that should be scared of us! We are REAL MADRID!
<|emo_disgust|> He looks like he’s trying to blow shit up with his mind
<|emo_anger|> ...and show some respect to her parents!

<|emo_fear|> There’s this which is terrifying to think about
<|emo_sad|> I'll miss [NAME]
<|emo_joy|> Just got the Ultimate edition and it's already my favourite game of all time. I just wish everyone could agree [NAME] is best girl
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad you had such a positive experience on the sub and congrats on the relationship.
<|emo_anger|> and how the fuck isn’t the man dead and there is a freaking rock 10 times bigger than him
<|emo_anger|> Watching this makes me angry.
"<|emo_disgust|> [](/ironwillthumbsup) True! Weird, but true!"
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah whether or not an animal is cute is pretty subjective, I was just in a bad mood when I wrote the post honestly."
<|emo_joy|> I like the way your brain works OP. Always did enjoy bugs bunny humour.
<|emo_sad|> sadly it is ;-;
<|emo_anger|> It must suck to be so boring that all you can talk about is an expensive watch
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has to have a shot. Tough son of a bitch. Also [NAME] = [NAME].
<|emo_surprise|> This. I saw a life pro tip a couple weeks ago about this. I cant believe how clean my kitchen has gotten.
<|emo_joy|> I really enjoy my job but I get paid $62k I don't know if that's considered high paying but it's plenty for me.
<|emo_fear|> Why did she get married if she did not love him? Aren't you afraid the same thing wil happen to you?
<|emo_disgust|> >Rise of Agon Literally the worst fucking game that man kind has ever managed to accomplish and you call him a carebear? Fuck out of here.
<|emo_surprise|> You mean...I **don't** have to be #blessed and #thankful that I am moving to another country at the end of this month?
"<|emo_fear|> Damn, [NAME], you *are* brutal 💀😆"
"<|emo_anger|> I'd understand if it was because of his conduct, but because of money? We're the Yankees, what the fuck man"
<|emo_disgust|> You get a creepy dog biscuit
<|emo_fear|> After all that i expected it to not look terrible. Oh well.
<|emo_sad|> He's dressing like his dead 'friend' to keep him in his memory
<|emo_disgust|> I woke up drunk and mouthy
<|emo_sad|> I miss the confetti cakes :(
<|emo_disgust|> Probably when they fired their cartoonist a few months ago for having the wrong opinions.
"<|emo_fear|> Don’t worry, he’s more afraid of you than you are of him. Just act tough, it’ll work...maybe..."
<|emo_joy|> Sending you warm wishes :) <3
<|emo_fear|> GUYS WHAT IF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE UPVOTING THE HORNY IMAGES *ARENT* THE SAME PEOPLE AS THE ONES WHO DONT LIKE CAMILLA WHHOOOOOOAAAAA
<|emo_joy|> Good viral marketing attempt [NAME]!
<|emo_disgust|> >also seen a few snaps Bad pun...BAD!
<|emo_surprise|> Omg is that cesspool where he lives?! Barf! 🤢🤢🤢🤢
"<|emo_anger|> No, it would not. How the hell is that evidence that [NAME] didn't commit the crime?"
<|emo_surprise|> Hell yes!
<|emo_fear|> Because its creepy and weird
"<|emo_surprise|> Eh, you can't really judge his character solely on the appearances he makes on his GF's IG without making a ton of presumptions"
<|emo_disgust|> The real bad beat.
<|emo_anger|> You got this! Go easy on yourself man..
<|emo_surprise|> I think it's safe to say I've peaked. 16/25 on the second half wouldn't all that surprising but I probably whiffed on [NAME]
<|emo_anger|> This just makes me angry.
"<|emo_sad|> Did you hear about that old Italian chef? Sadly, he pasta way."
<|emo_disgust|> Honestly never seen one as dumb as this.

<|emo_joy|> You're glad Australia was playing politics at a time like this? That's not a vote of confidence in the [NAME].
<|emo_joy|> Ha ha ha. That was a good one
<|emo_sad|> Oh man that hurt to watch
<|emo_anger|> Don't worry about stupid people and you do whatever you want. Screw them kind of people.
<|emo_surprise|> Im just glad it didn't take any of that for us. I'm glad I didn't have to see a [NAME] screaming match
<|emo_anger|> I'm thinking he ment [NAME] but he's still a karma stealing whore.
"<|emo_joy|> very well put. wow i love that man, i’d play a mean game of chess w him"
"<|emo_anger|> you have zero evidence that anything in this story is fabricated. your blind cop hatred just really, really wants you to believe that."
"<|emo_anger|> ""THE SAMPLE SUCKS! THAT TOWN HALL MEETING WASN'T EVEN AS GOOD AS THE TLIC ONE"" "
"<|emo_joy|> Except for ""fighting liberalism"". Happy cake day."
<|emo_disgust|> Ugh. People are the worst!
"<|emo_anger|> Lol, no one can say that because you don’t know who the fucking shooter is. What’s going through your head?!"
<|emo_disgust|> Probably left the crusts on ! Borderline abuse right there !
"<|emo_surprise|> I am from Darwin, and can NOT confirm that ""Darwin has a surprisingly high amount of good looking women"" Must be hanging around the wrong places"
"<|emo_joy|> Everyone keeps giving me that advice haha. She's happily married to a really nice dude, and she is basically my sister at this point."
"<|emo_anger|> Emotions are temporary. That's why we have multiple different ones. If you were permanently happy, you'd never feel sadness or envy or anger again. "
<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. Didn’t realize it was that broad.
<|emo_surprise|> I can’t believe sb found this even remotely funny.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] FIRED.
"<|emo_anger|> America is not a country, it's a fucking business. if you have zero money, no one cares about you."
<|emo_anger|> I wish I could tell you if it was a good t.v. Let me just find the MOTHERFUCKING REMOTE!!!!!!!!
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh man, are we actually getting a real Ghostbusters sequel?"
<|emo_disgust|> To make money from money is disgusting and is screwing up the economy.
"<|emo_anger|> I cringed so much just reading that tweet, I didn't even make it to the comments. That's my fucking President. :("
<|emo_sad|> Accidentally dropped my cologne... stings the eyes
"<|emo_sad|> Meh, I'm actually pissed at some of the people I usually defend for getting excited about this too.... we did lose our data."
"<|emo_sad|> I won't cry any crocodile pears for you, that's for sure."
<|emo_sad|> She refuses them by inhaling them [I'm sorry if that sounded bad plz no downvite]
"<|emo_sad|> Vanity is a sin, [NAME] wants us to hate our bodies"
<|emo_sad|> This one is sad but also very good
"<|emo_sad|> Thank you very much. I try my best to follow my steps from therapy, but it seems to be my biggest hurdle."
<|emo_joy|> He gets to watch boxing for free and get paid for it. It's probably his dream job. I'm happy for him! :)
<|emo_disgust|> I post on the the Donald you think I give a fat flying fuck?
<|emo_anger|> What a useless tool.
<|emo_anger|> I AM LITERALLY FREAKING THE FUCK OUT
<|emo_sad|> I hate those days man... So triggering
<|emo_surprise|> All the plans I have seen proposed were over 5 years. This is a crazy one time jump.
<|emo_anger|> Your ass after I beat you so hard you shit yourself
<|emo_joy|> Yeah that makes a lot of sense and I'm glad you looked passed all the negativity
<|emo_sad|> This should be the norm instead of the exception. Sadly the leaders in law enforcement are almost always more into politics than principles.
<|emo_surprise|> I've never heard of this place. I know what we are doing next time we're up there!
<|emo_surprise|> 30 people is big for you...? Dang im middle eastern and it's over 500 guests each time..
<|emo_anger|> Some rambling paragraphs about what a waste I am and how sorry I am to be a disappointment to those around me and that sort.
<|emo_anger|> How the fuck do you moan tho
<|emo_joy|> Enjoy the ride!
<|emo_sad|> it is dangerous to date men - read the news - women get killed by male partners and ex partners very frequently. Women are amazingly brave.
"<|emo_surprise|> Yes, good for Destiny and Bungie, I wonder if they will return to Microsoft, remain independent or sign with another company."
"<|emo_fear|> Those refs were terrible, god damn. GG Buckeyes, it was much closer than the score suggests."
<|emo_joy|> I think you're right. She has oodles of cash and young grandchildren to enjoy. Going through that hideous gauntlet again probably isn't that appealing.
"<|emo_joy|> Watching girly tv shows. Stuff like gossip girl, pretty little liars, and gilmore girls are all a guilty pleasure"
<|emo_anger|> Can you stop shilling for Russia every damn time they are mentioned?
<|emo_anger|> Some sort of f***ery is going on here.
"<|emo_joy|> I stand corrected. As I said, wonderful charities. I will always enjoy GDQ, just not revalant to my experience."
<|emo_sad|> I don't really understand what you mean 😩 haha Can you explain please?
<|emo_joy|> Happy to be able to help.
<|emo_disgust|> Ugh... hate when people talk to me when I'm fishing. This would be so awful hahaha
<|emo_joy|> That's my meds when going through interviews lol. Glad you made it!!
<|emo_disgust|> You are BOTH awful people.
"<|emo_fear|> Are you in enough of a hurry to get in anyway? (Morbid humor, sorry. That’s really horrific.)"
<|emo_sad|> I never understood the real harm until I started reading about childhood emotional neglect and how much it affected me. It's very common with nParents.
<|emo_anger|> It doesn't justify singling one guy out when the whole team played bad. Even [NAME] had a bad game.
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] thats real? I'm so glad i unsubbed from pics
<|emo_disgust|> I am getting a lot of weird replies...
"<|emo_sad|> whats the [NAME] story ? sorry, not up to date on the bloke"
<|emo_anger|> £20 per child?! That is ridiculous! You can’t buy much of anything for that! I am furious on your behalf!!
<|emo_joy|> That all-star who won the calder
<|emo_disgust|> The comment was so terrible. I can’t believe it made the final cut.
"<|emo_sad|> Hey, we have that problem too. Remember at least one number, folks. It's in your best interest in case of an emergency or jail."
<|emo_disgust|> Looks like he has a history of being an awful human:
"<|emo_surprise|> Just read your list, sounds great!! You have some creatures even I didn’t think about 👍!!"
<|emo_anger|> whats it like being this stupid?
<|emo_surprise|> Hahaha. I see what you did there!
<|emo_sad|> I meant from when I was a kid and teen. Sorry.
<|emo_disgust|> As a student in DC Universities I hope to fucking god they get rid of blackboard and replace it with canvas.
<|emo_joy|> Happy to hear this! Stay strong and continue fighting! We believe in you <3!
<|emo_sad|> being mentally ill =/= crazy
"<|emo_joy|> Take it easy, hater. He nailed it."
<|emo_joy|> cheers friend. same thing happened to me 2 days ago. hazzah!
"<|emo_disgust|> MeToo is about sharing personal stories of sexual assault. Reframing it as accusation based, and as furthering a kidnap, is fucking disgusting."
<|emo_anger|> You fool you're using logic on a show that is clearly not bound by any
<|emo_sad|> Not all of us young teens eat tide pods Mom would be sad
<|emo_sad|> You’re trash april. I’m November 2000 actually. Damn we’re old.
"<|emo_surprise|> Here's a gun ""oh good something to beat it with"""

<|emo_anger|> Holy shit that was fucking bad...
<|emo_fear|> Sure hope #4 includes subsidized housing. I'm terrified.
<|emo_fear|> And isolated rooms? When I had to go in with my baby with chickenpox they put us in a room where no one else was.
"<|emo_disgust|> Ugh, this fucking tumblr account. I posted about this bitch before, they wrote that [NAME] drug rehab fanfiction."
<|emo_fear|> This is the scariest thing I think I’ve ever read on here. That is just so horrible.
<|emo_sad|> Yes. I hate everything that has to do with my depression.
<|emo_anger|> fuck off. let people enjoy what they want to enjoy when it doesn't impact you.
<|emo_anger|> yup - he threw [NAME] under the bus with no guilt
"<|emo_sad|> like I said, it's painful."
<|emo_joy|> I so remember that!
<|emo_disgust|> hmm... it didnt work for me when i posted it but now it does... weird af
<|emo_anger|> What? They all like Kingdom Hearts on Oneyplays. They just make fun of how ridiculously stupid the plot is.
<|emo_disgust|> Some judges are just literally scum. Have those in Germany aswell. Unfortunately.
<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid of having a sit down with them amd not being heard. But I might have to for my safety.
<|emo_anger|> It just isn't... Admit it
"<|emo_sad|> For crying out loud, all they had to do was use the smegging wipers!"
<|emo_fear|> Never terrible in clutch
"<|emo_joy|> Lmao, okay little buddy. Have a nice day. "
<|emo_sad|> Yo but that RivaL lineup tho! That's gonna be so sick
<|emo_anger|> Who gives a shit. Stay in your fucking car.
<|emo_surprise|> > you're probably a little bit of a closeted nazi yourself. I'm just SHOCKED that someone named [NAME] might be a fascist
<|emo_surprise|> Wow another person in Dunedin uses Reddit

<|emo_sad|> World has Turned and Left Me Here.
<|emo_joy|> Keep on auto aiming bud. One day you'll get good maybe haha.
"<|emo_anger|> This is a test, now YOU have to give away that gold. Your donor was a cruel benefactor. "
<|emo_disgust|> My office has very few personal offices. Its awful. Managers need closed spaces so they can talk without everybody hearing
"<|emo_joy|> Being a nice, interesting person has helped me get a lot of friends but hasn't really gotten me anywhere with regards to women. "
"<|emo_disgust|> Plus, thinking you know someone that you don't just weirds them out. It must be disturbing having people flock around your persona, ffs."
<|emo_surprise|> Damn it even comes with changeable speedshanks
<|emo_surprise|> Wonder what the sub’s average age is.
<|emo_surprise|> I always wondered how testicles sound when popping.... hoping that it would never happen to me.
"<|emo_disgust|> You’re disgusting. I hope your wife finds somebody much, much better than you."
<|emo_disgust|> I get Botox for migraine and my eyebrows don’t do this ... she looks like she is on drugs .
"<|emo_sad|> i ended up crying and breaking down once i got to my friends house, i'm so sorry that happened to you as well :~( "
<|emo_joy|> Whoa I'm impressed he returned the pillow to its original spot. Awesome parenting.
<|emo_disgust|> Exactly. It's rediculous
<|emo_joy|> This was ten years ago...but I have faith in people to be nice. Knoxville was amazing when I lived there.
<|emo_joy|> Oh god I miss Jet's. And I don't get to come home for another 3 months. Enjoy it for me.
"<|emo_fear|> The middle was an analogy. No one here condones terrorism, as that's attacks on civilians, Destruction of financial buildings isn't that. "
<|emo_anger|> This just reminded me to continue designing that bloody website.
<|emo_surprise|> That's... pretty unexpected actually.
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME], “How dare you show concern for the wounded!” Made me chuckle."
<|emo_disgust|> He has a prog rock album.. its horrific
<|emo_joy|> i think the telekinesis could make a great card. sth like: move an enemy card to another position and stun its new neighbors for this round.

"<|emo_sad|> I can’t work, wish I could. Worked hard my whole life and lost literally everything a few years ago. 20 years down the drain."
"<|emo_sad|> Yea that 3rd period was pretty bad tho, [NAME]"
<|emo_surprise|> wow! trust issues.
"<|emo_sad|> They’re honestly a cult at this point. It’s not just sad, but incredibly scary."
<|emo_fear|> Plant 3-0. UZ is just coming in without jabbing getting caught
"<|emo_anger|> Can't speak for that dude, but I'd say hell yeah they're a hate sub. "
"<|emo_joy|> I wasn’t a fan of theirs on the show, but I am very happy for them both and wish them the best of luck in life "
<|emo_disgust|> Child labor laws are ruining this country
<|emo_joy|> You just made me so happy.
<|emo_surprise|> I know North America is a big place but I wonder what it will take to see similar crowds in cities over here.
"<|emo_anger|> roll a blunt, walk over and strike a conversation.... or mind your fcking business"
"<|emo_sad|> It's unfortunate how appealing that is to the facists, racists, ethno-nationalists and [NAME] that form the back bone of Israel's support. "
<|emo_fear|> You can do it but it won’t be easy or fast keep watching craigslist.
<|emo_anger|> I meant after tech school but thanks
<|emo_joy|> Ty going through a lot right now and this made me smile.
<|emo_joy|> I love this. Kids just live in the moment which makes them so unaware of so many things.
"<|emo_joy|> I was actually looking in to this game, glad they did this now so I can avoid it, yeesh"
<|emo_joy|> I’ve thought about it... if my next job doesn’t really make me happy. My wife is all for it.
<|emo_anger|> You are an asshole.
<|emo_sad|> Wtf did I just read? That was painful
"<|emo_surprise|> Eh, I find everything being dead a bit more gloomy than a few clouds."
<|emo_surprise|> I mean I like the park and I was surprised by that poll too
<|emo_disgust|> Subpoena is still one of the weirdest words I’ve ever seen
"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] and [NAME] were the ones I had in mind, but I'm not surprised they're not the only ones from what I've heard."
<|emo_joy|> You can get so much money from hunting. Fishing is probably the best method if you’re grinding but I actually enjoy hunting
<|emo_anger|> Thats it I am out. This sub stinks.
<|emo_joy|> To each their own. I enjoy it for what it is
<|emo_disgust|> Demented feminist ad Literally is just ad saying don’t be a scumbag k
<|emo_anger|> Fuck sake man
"<|emo_anger|> The FDA has plenty to criticize. But like here, it's usually criticized horribly off base. It needs to grow some balls and actually enforce things. "
<|emo_surprise|> I’m surprised I had to scroll this far down
<|emo_surprise|> Wow so much younger but he sounds mature
<|emo_fear|> The fact that they're flying their drone in the rain gives me anxiety.
<|emo_anger|> Gotta offload this crap somehow.
<|emo_disgust|> It’s really hard to watch for some people because of how awkward and... just how stupid [NAME] is in this episode
<|emo_sad|> Serious creep vibe when she put on the wedding dress.
<|emo_joy|> Congratulations! Hard work always pays off! :) Hope you enjoy your new job!!
<|emo_joy|> this is such a happy video
<|emo_fear|> Being too scared of calling someone isn’t a disability for fuck sakes... use some common sense and grow up.
"<|emo_fear|> As a rep 6 orochi, those dodge attacks from neutral made me cringe."
"<|emo_sad|> Dragon bender has even more negative value than [NAME] haha. But yeah, they’d need atlesst a 2nd for [NAME] crossover "
<|emo_anger|> MULTIPLE TIMES NOW IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLY NICE ON THE MOUNTAIN THE DAY DIRECTLY AFTER I GO SKIING.
<|emo_joy|> Happy cake day !
"<|emo_anger|> Optimism dial at 13, absolute mad man"

<|emo_sad|> Yeah I could not even do that I could not move my leg to the side
"<|emo_fear|> I have. Here, its implying he wants to fuck the dog. The original the dog is just scared of him."
"<|emo_sad|> Don't see it at all, but she's cute with the freckles"
<|emo_surprise|> That's really creepy. What is crazy is that 9 year old's get cell phones now! Times have certainly changed :p.
<|emo_sad|> I’m always reminded by my relatives on my birthday asking me if I have a girlfriend yet. Sorry bro ima yeet out of the social norm.
<|emo_joy|> Ayyy you're welcome! x)
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] spam them till they bleed out.
<|emo_anger|> Men are the worst.
<|emo_surprise|> OMG this is gaming history in the making. Lol I can't w8!
"<|emo_surprise|> > freak degenerates who live to subvert all [RELIGION] values and Prods What? Are you for real? [NAME], tell me it isn't true."
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry, no punch line today. You guessed correctly on half an apple tho. Cheers"
"<|emo_joy|> I think dogs should vote!! It's alright. We're your friends now. Cheers, pal!"
<|emo_sad|> I wonder if the formal letter from the psychiatrist will help if cops just decide to shoot her first :(
<|emo_surprise|> And so are you!
"<|emo_sad|> Yes, very sad but that's the reality of competitive online gaming right now"
<|emo_surprise|> omg ;; my boy heavy
<|emo_anger|> No the limiting factor is the leader raped a young boy and paid his silence
<|emo_joy|> I'm so glad you're annoyed.
<|emo_disgust|> I feel you. It's weird that we don't see [NAME] or [NAME] in the promotional stuff though.
<|emo_anger|> My 3 year old is an asshole. His 8 year old sister was also an asshole at 3. It gets better!
<|emo_sad|> I'm sad that you are against abortion. Can I drop my unwanted baby off at your door ?
"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, that shit's decarboxylated af! That'll get you nice and sleepy... I foresee a weed nap in the near future..."
"<|emo_anger|> “1, personal space. 2, I like my personal space. 3 get outa my personal space...”"
<|emo_sad|> That's far from what happened and there is overwhelming evidence to the contrary of the circumstances of her death that it leaves no room for debate really.
<|emo_disgust|> You stole an Instagram meme? For shame
"<|emo_disgust|> What does that have to do with [NAME] having sex with a child, what's the point you're trying to make with that piece of information?"
<|emo_fear|> Modern buildings are horrible.. I’ve felt like this before. Stars and birds still fill me with a sense of wonder most often.
"<|emo_anger|> I pose you this question, ""How do you know [RELIGION] is not the right religion?"""
"<|emo_sad|> Oh I didn’t realise, sorry for my ignorance "
<|emo_sad|> The one that is a sentient being; the one that's most affected.
<|emo_disgust|> The main reason I left is a hidden mmr used to influence matchmaking in a mode that requires a paid entry. That's disgusting
<|emo_sad|> I passed the aftermath of this wreck on the other side of I-20. What a tragedy.
"<|emo_disgust|> Not even surprised by rudi, the man has been a beast since we got him."
"<|emo_surprise|> No, but its a big problem in itself. "
<|emo_sad|> >seek truth no matter how painful it is maybe you should take your own advice
"<|emo_anger|> I love democracy, that's why I hate antidemoratic institutions like the EU."

<|emo_joy|> yes Yes YES # YES
<|emo_anger|> Brooklyn-Boston playoffs would be the most toxic thing of all time. Only Sixers-Cs would be worse
<|emo_sad|> It's hard to care about a woman dying from giving birth when you hate women in the first place.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you must have no idea what medium of exchange means."
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad to see when people succeed! I'm very happy for ya and life is going uphill which is always a great sign
<|emo_joy|> Just be supportive and listen. Maybe do something that would make her happy like a favorite chocolate
<|emo_sad|> For sure...sometimes I feel like I will just evaporate into nothingness as the stranger in the mirror looks on.
<|emo_joy|> So those 2am cravings are really just my instincts keeping me alive
<|emo_anger|> It's even worse when you get someone from NJ who has no clue how to drive in the city environment.

"<|emo_surprise|> >Dupage county Dupage County just elected a Democratic rep, what on earth are you talking about."

<|emo_fear|> Fear mongering.
<|emo_disgust|> Advocating for rape and torture of women on a whole and even inciting men to do it seems like it should break the rules.
<|emo_joy|> I was expecting this to go MUCH worse than it did and I’m so glad my imagination wasn’t right.
<|emo_joy|> Not sure how you got that outta my post. I play a lot of non-meta stuff all the time just because I find it fun or challenging.

"<|emo_anger|> I hate the argument too. It betrays and exposes the violent, primitive ape amygdala response that is most Human social interaction. "
<|emo_sad|> im trying to but my depression gets the better of me i have my good days and bad days
<|emo_joy|> Well that’s sad. It might’ve been funny if it was fake.
<|emo_anger|> Fuck her... don’t live to make your parents happy
<|emo_sad|> Whataburger misses you
<|emo_disgust|> The biggest Nightmare
<|emo_disgust|> Um yea. You’re being creepy. Stop stalking her
<|emo_surprise|> You’ve never shit yourself as an adult?? If an adult can then a kid definitely can
<|emo_joy|> Congrats for coming out 😁😁
<|emo_surprise|> I can’t believe sb found this even remotely funny.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow the garbage one and the bank one are really terrible. I’ve had the coupon ones too, people are touchy about coupons haha."
<|emo_anger|> “I hate rich people” - people using website made by rich person on a device made by a rich person.
"<|emo_sad|> Nah, they're a fraction as immature and petulant as the politician we can't ignore that actually affects our lives."
<|emo_joy|> I love seeing the crowd's reaction to that every away game.
<|emo_joy|> But what if that's the only job I would enjoy?
<|emo_joy|> Thank you! Looks delicious.
"<|emo_disgust|> You can, but it won’t do anything for your ugly personality."
<|emo_disgust|> I got a far related cousin that killed himself this exact way. A branch punched back the chainsaw right back at his forehead.
<|emo_anger|> What reason do you have for not already having been prepared?
"<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how that works if the seatbelt wouldn’t fit even if they were sitting in a regular seat? They only go so far, right?"
"<|emo_sad|> My dads dislocated his twice. If it happens once, the knee is sometimes weakened which means it can happen again easily. "
<|emo_fear|> I feel like I got lured into a fever dream by a normal combo video's beginning
<|emo_anger|> Fight me coward! I will never ne frego!
<|emo_anger|> As The Pot Bro's always say. When the Cops ask you questions. Shut the fuck up.
<|emo_sad|> I'm sad that you are against abortion. Can I drop my unwanted baby off at your door ?
<|emo_anger|> Where is that damn SaLt LiCK
<|emo_anger|> I hate having to take my shoes off!
<|emo_joy|> Luckiest I’ve been is getting the toy I actually wanted from a McDonald’s happy meal.
<|emo_anger|> you almost blew my fucking mind there.
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad none of you are GM
<|emo_joy|> Omg I’d happily live in Cape Town instead of the US!! It’s literally one of my favorite cities on earth!!
<|emo_sad|> my brain hurts...
"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] & [NAME]? Also, his ass is as big as her back. "
<|emo_anger|> You have devoted yourself to this guy and he thinks you would be a bad mom. Fuuuuuuuck this guy. You deserve better.
"<|emo_disgust|> 2 is washed out, 6 and 10 are too dark. Also imgur showed me a bald naked chimpanzee right after your last picture and I nearly choked. "
<|emo_sad|> he'll be hurt next year too
<|emo_joy|> Wow. If it shows calls on the bill then what good is it? Glad I asked...
<|emo_anger|> I'm just salty man. I hate playing Houston. I'm sure it's a nice place to live.
<|emo_fear|> She looks like snooki bro
<|emo_sad|> Holy shit I was so anxious reading this. I’m so sorry
<|emo_fear|> Oh. I have anxiety for her and this conversation.
"<|emo_surprise|> What a beast! Self defense definitely, hopefully the brain trauma will teach them a thing or two ^^^probably ^^^not though"
<|emo_sad|> I can appreciate that but snitches get stitches unfortunately
"<|emo_disgust|> How can someone be so stupid to post that online, let alone publicly do that"
"<|emo_anger|> trust me, you do not want to do this. i used to live with 2 party people and it was absolute hell. save yourself now"
<|emo_disgust|> what a shame that online sellers have made malls obsolete
<|emo_disgust|> Ironically every /pol/ meetup is more diverse than the people pushing diversity and race mixing. Weird how that works huh
<|emo_fear|> I'm scared for her. The Saudi government has proven to be very brazen in its disrespect for international law.
<|emo_sad|> This hurts my brain
<|emo_sad|> I cried more here than in Star Wars.
<|emo_sad|> I’m convinced WB is more of a pain than it’s worth. Good luck making adjustments during the semester. I feel your pain.
<|emo_surprise|> I thought it was still in theaters.
"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah that is a pretty crap and unhelpful thing to say, especially coming from someone who works in that job. "
<|emo_joy|> I'm so glad you weren't physically hurt
<|emo_anger|> I hate people who have the blinders on when it is one of their friends
"<|emo_disgust|> Human nature also leads us to greed, violence and aggression. Natural doesn’t equal good. Cancer is natural."
"<|emo_joy|> +1 Thought I had depression, turns out I just wasn’t being happy enough! Who’da thunk it."
"<|emo_sad|> Agreed. Sadly, it's not uncommon enough, and it makes me sad because of the implications about mutual respect or the lack thereof."
<|emo_anger|> You’re mean
"<|emo_fear|> I swear, this is the most brutal one of this year yet. "
<|emo_fear|> Ah ok I thought by terrific you mean terrific at reducing speeding since (I think) that is the policy objective. Cheers!
"<|emo_sad|> Maybe. But I can’t think straight and she is the only person who could save me right now, and she’s gone"
"<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry, do people NOT listen to [NAME] 9th while driving?"
<|emo_joy|> Went on a trip to the Austin area. This park is nice if you haven’t been there. Subscribe if you can. Enjoy
"<|emo_joy|> While this makes me happy to know, it would probably be for the best if we didn't post these things where abusers can find out about them."
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if your mother is proud of the person you became
<|emo_joy|> Bahaha that wasn't a shot attempt until the last second
"<|emo_joy|> Man, I would cry tears of joy if my two-year-old cousin could just say my name, let alone say a coherent sentence."
<|emo_fear|> Really confused how every comment with more than 1 upvote says this isnt cringe and yet the post has 1.3k votes...?
"<|emo_anger|> And in adult spaces in general. Let adults have things to themselves, damn it"
<|emo_fear|> Me too! I got scared that I've been laundry inpaired my whole life and never even realized it!
<|emo_surprise|> I cannot believe a woman in her 30s has never had an orgasm. I would have tried everything on the planet to have one.
<|emo_surprise|> Damn. So you went back to an old medication and found it no longer worked for you??? I didn't even know that was possible.
"<|emo_sad|> Underrated comment, my friend! Know that you made me genuinely laugh!"
"<|emo_fear|> [NAME] i love this ""no one can be THIS happy, what a horrible person he must be"""
<|emo_fear|> We will never survive with 5% unemployment with moderate growth and a continued house building program to correct supply. Sounds horrendous
<|emo_anger|> Ive seen that move no less than 5 times and I still get irrationally angry at the Harvard rich kid
<|emo_fear|> You are the smiley face killer
"<|emo_sad|> All that interesting information and you get 3 upvotes , feels bad man "
<|emo_sad|> Unnecessary. This was painfully obvious
<|emo_sad|> Ugh I am in this same place right now. Dating a husband whose wife calls all the shots. I feel for you.
<|emo_surprise|> oh [NAME] what did i do
<|emo_anger|> If you don't like margaritas get out of the salt mine!
<|emo_joy|> I can easily relate to that as well. The siblings are the ones who will stick with us for the whole journey to the very end.
<|emo_disgust|> Pretty shit tbh with you
<|emo_disgust|> oh yes! i did not know pizza could possibly ever be disgusting until i moved to florida.
<|emo_fear|> Kitchens use bacteria floor cleaner it would almost definitely make you sick
"<|emo_anger|> Another reason to instantly kill people who constantly use the word ""awesome"" for everything. This is just brainless mediocrity at its best."
"<|emo_sad|> I wasn't meaning it as an insult or anything, sorry if it came off that way. "
<|emo_joy|> An afternoon of Big Cat vs Vol Twitter will be fun
"<|emo_sad|> 6'3 guy who wants to be the smaller guy here, [NAME] i feel you"
<|emo_sad|> I wish they didn’t hate [NAME] so much. Feels bad to play her.
<|emo_anger|> I have one crazy as hell three year old boy.
<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe he got it while getting man-handled by two players!!
<|emo_joy|> I can see Smileyboye receiving a [NAME] award a few years down the line.
<|emo_surprise|> I’m aware but you won’t see the Turkish state broadcaster promoting that filth.
<|emo_anger|> Why the fuuuhhh
"<|emo_joy|> If you don't like it, you didn't have to comment. Just let people be happy."
<|emo_anger|> Any rap song because I hate it
"<|emo_disgust|> As bad as this sub was in the 1st quarter, our announcers were just as awful."
<|emo_disgust|> Could be worse. At least he's not the guy who wrote the Witcher books LOL.
<|emo_joy|> That's awesome. Hahaha
<|emo_anger|> Need to change the subject of this post or it will be removed quickly but I hope those scum bags end up in jail.
<|emo_anger|> Isn't she like a worse version of [NAME]? I always hear from everyone that she is pretty trash.
<|emo_anger|> Impact? I'm merely interested in how low you will sink.
"<|emo_anger|> This is almost irritating. Like, take a breath, shithead..,"
<|emo_joy|> Wow full-screen twitch on mobile is cancer.
<|emo_joy|> That's why I'm glad they got [NAME].
<|emo_sad|> I'll second this notion. One of the first things to go is texting when I start getting sad.
<|emo_sad|> Because love is a lie and there is no happiness in the world
<|emo_surprise|> Was expecting a horrifically broken ankle. You have posted the actually unexpected
<|emo_surprise|> Beautiful!!! I always accidentally miss the 45 S exit at this location.
<|emo_anger|> I fucking hate [NAME]
<|emo_disgust|> American democracy is weak but it's not dead. If the intention of your comment was to discourage people from voting then you are the problem.
<|emo_anger|> Damnit! What song is that at the end!?!
<|emo_sad|> Seems like it’s very hard for her to laugh... I think it may physically hurt her face.
"<|emo_anger|> It's shit, it's over, put the damn format to bed and send the cunts who make it over to Fox"
<|emo_surprise|> So he is half decent. Glad to see your finally making some sense.
<|emo_surprise|> My man!
"<|emo_disgust|> ""Oh no, my blue heroes died, it's probably very bad, time to concede""."
<|emo_anger|> Palace please don’t fucking bottle this
<|emo_anger|> You get her off 3 times and she doesn't finish you? That seems very selfish.
<|emo_disgust|> This is amazingly unsatisfying.
<|emo_joy|> Hell yeah. Enjoy your new bachelor life son!
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] goes to insults when you have nothing smart to say. goodbye
<|emo_sad|> I literally screamed uncontrollably for 3 months and ended up in a mental hospital.
"<|emo_sad|> She had really bad chronic back pain from what I can remember, so was self treating with alcohol"
<|emo_anger|> ..how is he not? better == good
<|emo_sad|> Oh. Sorry.
<|emo_anger|> Stop doing weird things
"<|emo_anger|> I used to work with a guy that was always whining how tough his life was. My family this, my friends that. Very annoying"
"<|emo_sad|> I’m really sorry about your situation :( Although I love the names Sapphira, Cirilla, and Scarlett!"
"<|emo_disgust|> Just like you can't underestimate the capacity for evil, you can't underestimate the capacity for stupidity "
"<|emo_joy|> Wow, so he was pulling his own little mini [NAME] scam. Explains why he couldn't use your reporting tool."
<|emo_surprise|> Quite surprised I wasn’t on there
<|emo_anger|> >like it's a bannable offense A Singed man has actually been ~~banned~~ threatened by Riot for going support with smite and counter-jungling the opponent jungler.
<|emo_sad|> Going to get hard for everyone after brexit
<|emo_sad|> Once upon a time I got banned for a whole day because of bad behavior... Oh wait that was all of us...
<|emo_disgust|> It was done before and it was terrible
<|emo_surprise|> Hardly heard anyone I know talk about it but Damnation was amazing.
<|emo_anger|> Why would anyone forget how dominant he is? Lmao Oh yea we suck.
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] has been a pleasant surprise
<|emo_sad|> I laughed harder than I should have at this reply. Then the sadness hit me when I realized it wasn't meant to be funny.
<|emo_sad|> Mom-emotions are always heartwarming and honest but dad-emotions make me tear up. Fuck
<|emo_joy|> I’m excited!
<|emo_disgust|> He really would be. It's not even an abortion anymore!;It's just post-birth killing!
"<|emo_joy|> Oh man, how about when they played We Will Rock You to seemingly coordinate the ""ref you suck"" cheer. The crowd was awesome last night."
<|emo_sad|> Kids can't have fun anymore...:(
<|emo_joy|> CONGRATS! So happy for you. May life treat you kindly from now on.
<|emo_sad|> I'm sad we have you at home this year. I want to make a trip to see Allianz.
"<|emo_anger|> Waahha, ohh, they massawaaa... STOP IT. YOU CAN ACT LIKE A MAN."
<|emo_anger|> The fake news media and it's supporters are the enemy of the people.
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what a hug would feel like a lot too.
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh sorry. To clarify, I was wondering if I should mention that I am more than willing to help her if need be."
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME]: ""I like being bad. It makes me happy."""
"<|emo_anger|> I kind of hate it when I agree with you, but definitely do this time. "
"<|emo_joy|> Glad you had fun!! Did you all, ya'know? Did you all make plans to see each other again soon?"
"<|emo_fear|> Man, dropping is rather dreadful but nothing’s more dreadful when you can reach into your pockets expecting it to be there and it isn’t "
<|emo_surprise|> Damn kev I knew you love [NAME] but wow this is next level
"<|emo_sad|> What's the problem? The worst aspect is the DRM which is easily circumvented, and of course giving money to Amazon "
"<|emo_anger|> It can't be, I won't believe it.......this is some antivawers bulls**t xD"
<|emo_surprise|> That's a surprise from this guy.
<|emo_surprise|> I do not trust our defense at all. I do not believe you can increase the range of Andujar.
<|emo_anger|> This is the same woman who fought tooth and nail to have wrongful convictions upheld while she was a prosecutor; she craves tyranny.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I’m barely 2 cities over and it isn’t even nearly that cold :o
<|emo_joy|> The only way I can make people laugh
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] for sure
<|emo_joy|> I'm so happy you said this. I just accepted that I was going crazy.
"<|emo_joy|> I like spicy, but I have made poppers with mini bell peppers and they came out great. Good to have options"
<|emo_anger|> ok so that was fucking sick
<|emo_disgust|> Then go fucking cry you weak minded piece of shit.
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]
"<|emo_anger|> I would shoot a cop who shot my animal. Save the consequences for later, you just assaulted and possibly mortally wounded my best friend. ACAB"
"<|emo_sad|> Compared to the number of people fleeing Venezuela, the Honduras situation is a rounding error."
"<|emo_joy|> Get his master class. My boyfriend watched it and he got obsessed with cooking, knife techniques, etc. (for like 3 months)."
<|emo_sad|> The sad part is that we are not trying to tank
<|emo_disgust|> Lol all those people that disliked have probably never even done shrooms before
<|emo_anger|> You seem very angry. Maybe you should.... go jerk off.
<|emo_anger|> Fuck [NAME] for continuing to give her a platform.
<|emo_anger|> Especially that “Australia ain’t gonna cop it” ad on TV god I hate [NAME]
<|emo_anger|> A track would be much more suitable for this kind of recklessness! Keep this kind of dangerous driving off of public roads!
<|emo_sad|> having a serious relationship is too hard for other people
"<|emo_anger|> That is really dumb. If you have a crime committed against you, you have a civic responsibility to report it. We need those stats. "
<|emo_anger|> I hate that this is true. Some of these offices are such a pain to find and cash tips are never part of the equation
"<|emo_joy|> I mean who cares, this show isn’t built for perfection. It’s built for comedy. "
"<|emo_sad|> Personally, I assume that those who claim NOT to be deprived in this way are just adept liars. That's how deprived I am."
<|emo_joy|> Is this in New Orleans?? I really feel like this is New Orleans.
<|emo_surprise|> Isn't it awesome. And then they get praised for their problem solving skills and dedication.
<|emo_sad|> They are angry virgin children because he plays the game like it was supposed to be played. SOT has the most pathetic community ever.
<|emo_anger|> Thanks [NAME] but I don't think you understood the context of the phrase in my post and you should probably just fuck off.
<|emo_joy|> She is only good if a team has good communication. (And this is a ~600hr sombra main saying this.)
"<|emo_joy|> Ah, the good old days where you could lose in a game! Yes!"
"<|emo_anger|> This is still an inappropriate photo, no matter what type of dog it is"
"<|emo_surprise|> No, just act surprised if anything comes of it. "
<|emo_anger|> This comment is fucking cringey lol why the fuck do you talk like that
<|emo_joy|> They're both happy though
<|emo_joy|> Ah the good old fake dossier they admitted to fabricating Quality “comedy”
<|emo_surprise|> It makes me wonder if Old Money New England families are into their own cousins a bit much.
<|emo_anger|> Can’t believe people still fall victims to those machines.
"<|emo_joy|> Gotta share the love, have an upvote :) "
<|emo_disgust|> Oh cool so you admit to being a pedo.
<|emo_sad|> Your meme is bad and you should feel bad
<|emo_surprise|> Oh good one. It’s insane to think the last three mvps were once on one team
"<|emo_sad|> Ha, who cares about them supporters...the most important thing for society is that justice is served and the man jailed! Scream all you want. "
"<|emo_joy|> anyone is allowed to talk to a therapist, and get counselling. that was never the issue"

<|emo_sad|> Seeing him RT rev gave me some hope which hurts worse
"<|emo_joy|> Thanks for the reply. And I'm not gonna do that, no worries. I just enjoy getting knowledge about everything on the earth."
<|emo_disgust|> I don't think eating 4chan pizza is a good idea. Unless you're into some weird shit.
"<|emo_anger|> The only ignorant person here is you, and the Pope who makes the same baseless claims as you."
<|emo_anger|> it really sucks how absolutely fucked some of us got genetically in the chest department
"<|emo_anger|> Makeup can be expensive! Even though she got her makeup done now, she will have to replace those that she lost"
"<|emo_surprise|> the father sending up 4 donuts every morning via stair lift to dtr, before she even comes down to breakfast, wonders if he is enabling her."
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is getting ready for sex!!
<|emo_sad|> Very true. Apologies if it came off that way.
"<|emo_sad|> It also looks like it left an indented welt. He took it well, but I think he was in pain."
"<|emo_surprise|> I am sorry for offending you "" WoW yOu WoNt EvEn LeT mY cHiLd Go ThErE aGaIn"" how tf. Whoops didnt mean to reply lol"
<|emo_disgust|> Agreed. How do you feel about the rumors that he doesn't pick any girl as an endgame?
"<|emo_anger|> ""Fake neeeeeews !"""
<|emo_disgust|> Worst dad ever!
<|emo_sad|> You have to find the right woman honestly and its sad that divorce is so punishing
<|emo_disgust|> Part of being an adult is putting awkward on the back burner because some things are more important and need to be said.
<|emo_fear|> How incredibly dangerous
"<|emo_fear|> It sounds like you’re the one who is afraid of the internet. Relax, bud. You’re on r/cringe "
"<|emo_joy|> You know they are happy to see him. Yeah, he's not the most impact over all this work in the HOF but to start somewhere..."
<|emo_anger|> That's too many pills

<|emo_sad|> This is so tough for all of you! I'm so sorry!. Are you in Canada? I would push hard for a pediatric gastroenterologist.
<|emo_surprise|> Exactly. It was The fact that everything happened and ended so suddenly that left me speechless.
"<|emo_anger|> I just came home, what the fuck is this lineup? I love you [NAME] you mad bastard !!!"
<|emo_disgust|> How disgusting. Those vile people can burn in hell!

<|emo_surprise|> surprised he hasn’t mentioned [NAME] after saying [NAME] the best manager/coach he’s ever worked with
<|emo_sad|> Sorry but this is too rad to be cringe for me. This is like if [NAME] was a general.
<|emo_disgust|> I’m autistic and frankly this is disgusting. To say this about your child implies autism basically makes you worthless.

<|emo_anger|> He is going to hate 2019...
<|emo_joy|> Lmao. I fucking love this community.
"<|emo_joy|> Not sensitive, just scared that a sub I enjoy will become divided and will have in-fighting."
<|emo_anger|> just ban everything!
<|emo_sad|> I went to the avenues once. I was murdered twice in one day and they stole my grandma's jewellery from her grave in Minnesota!
<|emo_disgust|> Ughh same. Love the finish of it just wish it had more coverage.
<|emo_sad|> This aged poorly

<|emo_sad|> Definitely didn’t give [NAME] a huge scar
<|emo_disgust|> That is beyond disgusting.
"<|emo_joy|> I love them, it's so fun to jump around everywhere"
"<|emo_surprise|> My dyslexia read that as ""McFucking brilliant"" and I was wondering if we could make it a thing."
<|emo_anger|> Goddamned masterpiece.

<|emo_joy|> Can PG just chill
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow,29 turnovers. Something to talk about"
"<|emo_sad|> True, and so sad to see. Somewhere along the way, the governing of a country my mutual consensus turned into a national sport with 2 teams."
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow okay, where can I get a wind proof lining beaning or scarf? And do I have to cover my eyes or anything?"
<|emo_joy|> Yes!! THANK YOU. I’m happy the point of this story was not lost among all.

<|emo_anger|> Fuck I love you prag
<|emo_sad|> Damn sorry to hear bro. You guys still friends though?
<|emo_anger|> It's even worse when one considers that they are intent on moving to Europe and that by moving to a developed region their carbon footprint will increase significantly.
<|emo_joy|> This made me smile so hard. I am happy for you. May we all find our own happy and worthy constellations 💕
<|emo_anger|> Why was nobody driving the damn thing? They were all in the backseat. :/
"<|emo_surprise|> Whaaaat no way, you can’t play it with other people? "
<|emo_anger|> Obligatory fuck the dodgers
<|emo_joy|> I’m happy for you two. Cheers!
<|emo_anger|> Yeah well first god says it’s an abomination. Also if people find out everyone will hate me and my parents will be extremely angry
"<|emo_disgust|> Super weird question. Not really commenting either way, just so weird the life we have created for modern humans."
<|emo_anger|> Please no hate it’s my first post bro please
<|emo_anger|> **You are breaking the car!**
<|emo_fear|> I fell asleep with the feeds on last night and woke up pretty frightened at the noises coming from my computer. Thank you for casting Tom BB hahahaha
<|emo_sad|> It’s awful. I couldn’t even see the ending at all.
<|emo_anger|> Fuck her. I hate her so much. I wish she’s just vanish back to Indonesia with her mustache.
"<|emo_fear|> Don't worry, when you turn 20 you'll look back and cringe, too."
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh no, my secret identity as a neurosurgeon/entomologist/radiologist/anesthetist/dentist has been discovered! I knew I should have given less detailed medical advice online! D: "
<|emo_anger|> Gangs shooting each other on the streets is not the same as a crazy person going into a school and kill a bunch of innocent kids with an assault rifle.
"<|emo_disgust|> Nasty, pigeons are nasty."
"<|emo_anger|> THIS IS NOT DETROIT, MAN! THIS IS THE SUPERBOWL!"
<|emo_surprise|> Mine said I was most closely correlated with Gujarat (not a surprise) and Karnataka (which I didn't know at all)
"<|emo_anger|> It's because men feel entitled to date young and slim women but when a woman dates tall, dark haired guys they get ballistic."
"<|emo_joy|> It is awesome, and nothing turns me on more (as far as giving pleasure to my lover goes). Seriously."
"<|emo_surprise|> Oscars are trying to be more hip and contemporary now, so don't be surprised if [NAME] and [NAME] win. "
<|emo_sad|> Beautiful yet sad that his relationship ended in ‘45 the same way most of mine do...with cheating
<|emo_surprise|> What the fuck. Got that song on repeat right now
<|emo_joy|> Luckily every elevator would be broken at all times.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow did we marry the same guy. My STBX left the state for 3 months with no contact with his child.
"<|emo_joy|> > Woo that sadness out Welp, never gonna be able to have a night out on the town again without this coming up"
<|emo_anger|> This kills the country.
<|emo_disgust|> I was also bullied at work. I was on lithium for a while. You're not alone.
<|emo_anger|> I hate this world.
<|emo_surprise|> 6% of [NAME] is [NAME] so it wouldn't be a shock if he was of this community.
<|emo_disgust|> Goddamned masterpiece.
<|emo_sad|> Ned Stark: Dead Stark
<|emo_fear|> I’m starting to worry that [NAME] is not okay
<|emo_disgust|> That was truly disgusting
<|emo_sad|> I’m just shitposting dude. In the spirit of the thread “I was bored”
"<|emo_fear|> Im always worrying about the same thing, thats why Im always posting and within hours freaking out and deleting my posts "
<|emo_surprise|> I was wondering this too. Whatever it was it's over now.
<|emo_anger|> Ok well I hate to break it to you but I'm a magical pink unicorn...posting something on the internet does not make it true
<|emo_surprise|> omg good bot
<|emo_anger|> The Cavs didn’t even want [NAME]. They just wanted to fuck with us.
"<|emo_disgust|> That's horrible, good to know she is with an awesome guy."
<|emo_anger|> Fuck Up would be more appropriate. Fuckin marketing wankers.
"<|emo_joy|> Oh yeah, thanks, sorry for the confusion, good thing someone called their bullshit :)"
<|emo_sad|> What a beautiful memory for you to have found. So sorry for your loss ❤️
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] gives me the weirdest boner. I love these guys

<|emo_fear|> I can’t tell who’s wooshing who but I’m afraid to ask by this point
<|emo_disgust|> I am ashamed of your sequel memes. Prequel memes or no memes
"<|emo_disgust|> That's weird to hear since in Hebrew ""Son of man""- Ben Adam, simply refers to humans in general."
<|emo_surprise|> I really hope no one actually thought [NAME] would be our coach for next season.
"<|emo_sad|> I got undifferentiated androgynous, just slightly more femme than masc, which, honestly, sounds about right as an AFAB nonbinary person tbh"
<|emo_joy|> It was received on Jan 25th at 9:22 am .81627 BTC and $3800. for it with a $600. fee. Happy!
<|emo_sad|> No they haven’t and that’s probably a lot of the problem
<|emo_anger|> Looks like a plate to me. A stupid plate. But a plate nonetheless.
<|emo_sad|> Fascism = National Socialism Which is another reason why both Nationalism and Socialism are bad. [NAME] use some of their ideas!!!!!
<|emo_disgust|> This sub doesn’t like the pro sports teams until they win a championship. Then everyone becomes a die hard fan.
"<|emo_anger|> Nashville as a whole is easily one of the most classist, racist, judgemental, prejudiced cities I've set foot in. "
<|emo_joy|> Im not 😀 Glad you realize your mistake and why I was confused 😉
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels the same!
"<|emo_anger|> Its an mlm in disguise, branded to appeal to the college demographic. I got the fuck out "
<|emo_joy|> I was just scrolling down and I screamed when I got to the feet
<|emo_anger|> Wow dude get a life and stop digging through my comments trying to pick a fight like a belligerent moron.
"<|emo_joy|> It's the best, I haven't been so happy in a long time!"
"<|emo_sad|> Grammar guy, sorry, but vicarious doesn't work like that. Did you mean various? "
"<|emo_joy|> Hear, hear. I'm just lucky my career field is relatively un-fuckerized. Truer words have never been spoken."
<|emo_surprise|> Wow 😮 you really convinced me... like gtfo here
<|emo_sad|> I'm getting old. :/
<|emo_joy|> Happy cake day [NAME]
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that really hurts coming from a demented troll sockpuppets brigading me on this sub"
"<|emo_anger|> Considering that the picture OP jerked was fake and that the OP of the faked picture was rude as fuck to absolutely EVERYONE, that’s completely false. "
<|emo_sad|> no one cares my guy
<|emo_joy|> How random. I did that just riding around town for no reason and saw that lighting.
<|emo_joy|> i love [NAME]. itd be incredible to see her
<|emo_surprise|> ? ur slide is right stick
<|emo_anger|> Stop spreading false hope!
<|emo_anger|> I hope The pelicans trade him and [NAME] if they trade [NAME]. Hate to see them waste away in NO
<|emo_disgust|> man whenever [NAME] talks i feel like a deaf person because well I just can't hear shit
<|emo_surprise|> To be fair how often has someone drafted in the top 5 not immediately joined the team.
<|emo_disgust|> Vancouver is even more ridiculous.
<|emo_sad|> he'll be hurt next year too
<|emo_disgust|> What's the goop website?
<|emo_joy|> Omg I’d happily live in Cape Town instead of the US!! It’s literally one of my favorite cities on earth!!
"<|emo_joy|> LOL. When she came back on after the first commercial break, there was loud beeping when she was talking. "
"<|emo_disgust|> Boosting is when someone else is the biggest ad-hominem yet, because it was in a situation like this."
"<|emo_sad|> ""Sad"" but ""true"" There you go I fixed it for you."
<|emo_joy|> It’s nice to know that no one cares enough to send me either.
<|emo_disgust|> Well this is frustrating.
<|emo_anger|> Anyone that actually takes the train daily can tell you that. And I do feel its getting worse.
<|emo_disgust|> I hate these cakes so much.
<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised who posted this bc she's normally a sweet women but then there was this
<|emo_disgust|> Y'all ever try to ride a scooter with one hand before? Shit was dangerous.
"<|emo_sad|> I hope you’re doing well with RCIA! So sorry for your loss. Praying for you, your family, and your daughter ♥️"
<|emo_disgust|> Despite how much the Liberals and NDP apparently hate each other they really do work well together.
<|emo_joy|> Best! Episode! Ever! There is like a joke every 20 seconds.
<|emo_sad|> You're so talented OP. I like your sense of humor. But it hurts too cuz too real :(
<|emo_sad|> It’s one of my worst nightmares to have skin like that...I hope that person gets actual help
<|emo_disgust|> Haha! Yeah scentsy is terrible!
<|emo_disgust|> >it tasted horrible to use. Eating some of that right now. No regrets.
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, that was a serendipitous ending! The weed saved her life. "
<|emo_sad|> they should just stop broadcasting road games
<|emo_fear|> This is horrible
<|emo_fear|> It's practically non existent. Im mostly afraid to initiate a hug because I'm afraid I don't know/forgot how to hug.
"<|emo_joy|> So so happy, more than you believe "
<|emo_fear|> And then you can commit felony credit card fraud because they rejected you
<|emo_disgust|> The longer you look the worse it gets.
"<|emo_fear|> Not the right sub, I'm afraid."
<|emo_anger|> I had no idea what the fuck this was about. Found the ad and watched it. It's actually decent.
<|emo_fear|> I've invested 9 goddamn years watching these twits. I'm going down with the ship.
<|emo_sad|> Miss you...
<|emo_anger|> Df1 masterrace. Noctis on 3 bar is bullshit though.
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is like [NAME]. He can be in absolute trash and it's still okay because he's [NAME].
<|emo_joy|> I so badly wish we could all gain this mindset and keep it. How easy would life be.
<|emo_disgust|> then never drive because the person in the other lane could swerve over and kill you
"<|emo_sad|> i don't usually 'wall of text' posts but i'm glad i made your post an exception. thank you, it brought tears to my eyes."
<|emo_fear|> Fear of awkward and inconvenient encounters. What can he do to you?
<|emo_surprise|> Seriously?
<|emo_sad|> this video makes me sad
<|emo_fear|> Please tell me it opens up to a giant cave down there
<|emo_anger|> Yes. He was. Fuck off with your bullshit double standards.
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] is decent? Dude he was drafted 3rd overall he's been a massive disappointment
<|emo_surprise|> She looks so corrupt... Same with [NAME]
<|emo_surprise|> Can you imagine being taken to court over a flushing loo? I can’t believe the courts are even entertaining this.
<|emo_surprise|> Did no one else notice your stroke?
"<|emo_disgust|> I personally am very proud to be a vegetable. Corn, to be exact. Corn pride y'all"
"<|emo_anger|> I'm just concerned about [NAME] health. Do you think an old, ugly, fat, stupid person like him should be eating such unhealthy meals?"
<|emo_anger|> That's not an actual thing you realise? No one is that stupid.
<|emo_anger|> She should kick him out... next best thing from abortion.
<|emo_disgust|> Whoa I actually remember this. Wait shit does that mean I’m old
<|emo_joy|> I shower with the lights off. The first time felt really unnatural but now it's actually really comforting.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I'm glad he's okay."
"<|emo_sad|> Oof, yeah sorry my dude, it came across as pro-wall to me. Probably what happened with others as well."
"<|emo_sad|> All that interesting information and you get 3 upvotes , feels bad man "
"<|emo_sad|> Don't cry for me, Argentina."
<|emo_sad|> It didnt last long sadly
"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, why y'all posting the match threads this early."
"<|emo_sad|> You know I never thought I'd celebrate someone's death, but once she goes I'm going to have to try very hard to not enjoy it..."
"<|emo_sad|> Yup. I feel you. I'm very sorry it happened to you, too."
<|emo_surprise|> I drove off 170 onto 40 and was surprised by the lack of brakelights.... keep it closed haha
"<|emo_anger|> So, bloody stop feeding cattle, nothing even compares to the resource consumption (waste) of the animal industry."
<|emo_disgust|> See the Imperial Sourcebook from West End Games. That right there will show just how awful a regime the Empire was.
<|emo_joy|> Love how this had to be labelled: not satire
<|emo_sad|> That town is sadder than [NAME] town. I don’t remember it being anything besides rainy or gloomy in Ohio :( poor yonathan
<|emo_joy|> It's one of these situations where I'm happy that I'm not enough of a gimp to understand
<|emo_sad|> What a pathetic reply. I know we’re all supposed to be nice here but c’mon.
<|emo_sad|> Redskins were the best team in the NFC East until [NAME] leg snapped in half
"<|emo_sad|> [NAME] won't think they are bad shots cuz they are open threes. Unfortunately, we cannot hit them consistently. "
<|emo_sad|> I’m sorry about your friend.
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah i also like [NAME] now but that gives me a horrible idea. What if we think the same about fortnite later
"<|emo_joy|> Man I remember playing street hockey at desert breeze growing up, good times"
<|emo_anger|> they're shite - disgruntled OCSC fan
<|emo_surprise|> I'm actually surprised none of his wives have stabbed him in his sleep already. Now he has secret service protection 😋
"<|emo_anger|> Oh you're getting trolls trolls. Damn what sub you think they are getting you from, lol I'm not gonna mess with them."
<|emo_surprise|> As ironic as it sounds but her being a non factor is what ultimately won them the game (compared to inting [NAME])
"<|emo_joy|> .5x speed. Every moment I enjoy would last longer and any time I find myself in a pickle, I'll have more time to react appropriately."
<|emo_joy|> Im glad [NAME] was there for us
"<|emo_fear|> What scares me is that now that this happened, they're going to try and find ways to take women's phones away from them."
"<|emo_disgust|> IDK about you, but associating things with [NAME] do *not* make me want them more. Even delicious Cheetos. "
"<|emo_anger|> I wonder why the fuck out of this alive. well, there was a perfectly reasonable explanation."
"<|emo_anger|> Huh, neat ^^^^^^^^^^^^^fuck ^JJ ^tho"
<|emo_anger|> You're an uneducated twat.
<|emo_sad|> I'm so sorry
"<|emo_joy|> Yay, coming out is hard, you're lucky that they didnt avoid you for the next month, I'm happy for you"
<|emo_joy|> I amlooking to adopt from there! This makes me happy!
<|emo_anger|> Why was nobody driving the damn thing? They were all in the backseat. :/
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad your expectations are low..i am expecting full on knee jerk reactions if the game doesn't go well tonight.
<|emo_anger|> Why come here to spread hate?
<|emo_surprise|> OMG... Dad!
<|emo_joy|> There it is!
<|emo_sad|> I feel a little sad for her. That she thinks the only options or something to do is having kids. Fuck her tho.
"<|emo_anger|> Just don’t bother. Let them have their hateful circle jerk. When they lock eyes while coming, that’s their favorite."
"<|emo_sad|> worst case of life is unfortunately apt here, eh?"
<|emo_joy|> I’d go back to the 1996 season. That’s the last time we were in crazy cold territory.
<|emo_sad|> Dallas should feel absolutely horrible this is a 1 goal game given how patheticallly bad the Devils are tonight.
<|emo_disgust|> This is the one picture that gives me mad inferiority complex.
<|emo_sad|> Worst winter ever :(
<|emo_joy|> i think its cool because its a hybrid that comes in stickshift
<|emo_anger|> It’s treason then.
<|emo_anger|> It's also cruel how noone is informed about the execution at all. Relatives are left completely in the dark and likely never find out about their execution.
<|emo_anger|> I regret this post so hard so much debate and anger lol
"<|emo_disgust|> It's absolutely 100% abuse, as others have said you need to get the hell away from him."
<|emo_surprise|> Wow no wonder everyone is driving mopeds around. That's all there's room for.
<|emo_sad|> It would bother me so much to be so dependet from a Person. I am sure there is a way you can go without a person sponsoring You.
<|emo_anger|> That baby needs a smacking
"<|emo_joy|> Love the Ana's that peek snipe and get wrecked by [NAME], [NAME] or [NAME]. Good times."
<|emo_disgust|> It seemed weird to me as well. It's just 10mcg of cyanocobalamin with some fillers like corn starch and celulose.
<|emo_sad|> I got mine at 21. The ex wife would have had me snore instead of wear it for years.
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] deliver me from this nightmare I'm stuck in.
<|emo_surprise|> Surprised Greece doesn’t see [NAME] as their own. I mean he’s not from Greece but still Greek.
<|emo_anger|> just end the friendship and go meet more people. You're just prolonging the obvious.
<|emo_sad|> I have no friends.
<|emo_sad|> He was harsh on the other actors? Have you a source I can check out? I just can‘t remember him badmouthing anyone in particular :/
<|emo_joy|> Cool! Glad to see some cooperation.
"<|emo_joy|> I enjoy BOG and Italy at Epcot. But that’s just me. Also, probably better going to Golive Arden. "
"<|emo_disgust|> Thanks man. We had a taste of the storm Thursday. In South Central PA, we are all ready for the shit to fall."
<|emo_joy|> Bad execution but it made me smile through the cringe. The sentiment is definitely relatable.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, so that means common tongue isn’t English!?!"
"<|emo_sad|> I should say to you that it's ok but at the cancer thing my mind changed Asshole, also get help"
<|emo_disgust|> Sitting down and wiping is disgusting. Especislly when using a public toilet. Fucking savages up in this thread.
<|emo_joy|> His Batman/TMNT book is a really fun read with great art.
<|emo_sad|> Omg.........so true. I found that out personally. She was flirting with other guy's online @ 3 in the mornings. Wtf😟☹🤣
<|emo_sad|> We sacrifice them both to [NAME] and throw them in the Baler!
"<|emo_sad|> of course not, [NAME] and [NAME] were great friends and anyway, he's been dead since 2016."
"<|emo_anger|> Those are liberal comments, you fucking idiot. Liberals are capitalists."
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] lives. Obviously you can quote me on that, because i just said it. [NAME] dies. [NAME] dies. Fuck [NAME]. "
"<|emo_sad|> Jeter been enjoying the Miami nightlife a little too much maybe, dulled his senses. "
<|emo_disgust|> Huh? Mutts are usually healthier than pure-breds. It's the pure-bred dogs that have weird genetic issues.
<|emo_surprise|> Oil barons hate him!
<|emo_surprise|> A surprise turn of events! I'm so glad you heard such great things about yourself!
<|emo_disgust|> Omfg the worst!! want to pull my hair out!!
<|emo_sad|> These people have absolutely no confidence in their ability to make a living. It’s pathetic.
<|emo_sad|> The dying empire.
"<|emo_joy|> I would never tell anyone stick is better than pad, but speaking personally, it's way more fun"
<|emo_anger|> Who the hell thinks he isn’t overpaid
<|emo_sad|> Everyone is sad on this sub dont take it personally if you don't get any replies.
<|emo_surprise|> YIKES!!
<|emo_anger|> YES FUCK THE LEAFS. MAY THEY CONTINUE TO CHOKE IN THE POST SEASON.
<|emo_joy|> You sound like my gf. I'm so lucky to have her in my life.
<|emo_joy|> ? What do you mean? This is my favorite video game.
"<|emo_anger|> OK, so I still primarily blame the US. What's your point?"
"<|emo_disgust|> Police aside, storms and high tides may make things a little tricky"
<|emo_fear|> The worst!! I don’t get cramps so much but my back will kill me
<|emo_sad|> and everyone else is worried about themselves not paying attention to you
"<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe this team beat Winnipeg last week, handily too. That effort hasn't been there since. "
<|emo_joy|> well guys it was fun. [NAME] passed up the open three ffs
<|emo_anger|> look at that gym! Id kill to have one with such a nice view
"<|emo_anger|> fuck these dysfunctional, insecure mattresses"
<|emo_sad|> :( im sorry
"<|emo_surprise|> I was honestly shocked when they denied an overpayment, especially since after the charges cleared it would have been a $0 balance."
<|emo_surprise|> I play with all 20-24 year old so we most certainly did not hear the punishment on the radio. Not sure exactly where it came from though.
<|emo_sad|> Really sad how often people don't go into the closest lane first and then change lanes when safe to do so.
<|emo_anger|> I dont know why people are hating this so much. I guess everyone here wants to be just ok for the next 5 years
"<|emo_sad|> I mean, he's 6'0''. He just isn't thicc"
<|emo_sad|> I am 33 and I still regret things I said in the 5th grade.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] focus on local politics since it's the easiest to hide your cheating and corruption down there.
"<|emo_anger|> Roll survival check! Ooh, a nat 1, sorry kid"
"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah I don't have this issue because of this, seems it's more developed for HDR "
<|emo_sad|> Why are our trolls so boring :(
"<|emo_disgust|> hi [NAME], toxicity in a multiplayer game is something that should always be expected no matter the game cause people are assholes."

<|emo_joy|> Fuck yeah dude. I need pizza now also. The beer and bourbon are flowing nicely. Cheers and happy New year
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah, your dopamine receptors are going back to normal."
<|emo_sad|> Not all of us young teens eat tide pods Mom would be sad
"<|emo_anger|> literally everyone until there is not a single potential enemy left on this earth that's how fascism works, buddy."
<|emo_disgust|> She's so remarkably stupid.
<|emo_anger|> Yeah I don't mind the odd hunter or a daddy long legs but fuck those red backs. And whitetails Those cunts are vicious as all hell
<|emo_sad|> Imagine being triggered so hard that you ignore science and make up false claims
<|emo_surprise|> Omg!! Its rainbow!!
<|emo_joy|> This is the best creepy pasta I have **EVER** read.
<|emo_anger|> Stupid [NAME] is playing into the Church's hands. What an idiot. He has an amphetamine addiction.
<|emo_disgust|> I would not bother. He read your message and did not reply yet. So that's already a bad sign and not a good start.
<|emo_joy|> Has it really been that many games? How time flies when you got nothing to play for.
<|emo_surprise|> I'm honestly surprised you haven't been banned yet.
<|emo_surprise|> so you did listen but pretend not to know then. fine.
<|emo_fear|> Being so gullible is the frightening part. durr da durr he downvote me
"<|emo_sad|> We’re used to crazy cold weather but this is much worse, a lot of people are just staying inside till Thursday."
<|emo_anger|> Damn [NAME] let himself go
<|emo_disgust|> Ok but what if you hire him into a management position. He makes women feel uncomfortable and a discrimination suit waiting to happen.
<|emo_fear|> I took a picture of a farmer treating his crops with roundup yesterday.. it was horrifying
<|emo_sad|> I’ve only been there once but really enjoyed it!! But I think it’s missing a pool table ;)
<|emo_disgust|> That was truly disgusting
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] damn you are autistic
<|emo_joy|> Stop it. You're giving me that warm fuzzies now.
<|emo_disgust|> Ghosting sucks and is rarely excusable.
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad people with such foresight are the first to find this place unaffordable. Good riddance.
<|emo_sad|> Sorry I failed to mention I'm relatively new to the scene . Last 2 years only
"<|emo_fear|> Really visually haunting though. For me, it makes me think of strange alternate futures and dystopian sci-fi worlds. "
<|emo_anger|> He must smell terrible when he sweats. That's honestly pretty gross.
<|emo_sad|> Because this is a poorly run franchise. This is a bad team.
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry mate, you’ve got the wrong sub. This is for **bad** UK."
<|emo_sad|> I miss him so much during the NCAA tournament.
"<|emo_joy|> 😂 i need one too i’m on break and honestly my life revolves around reddit at this point, cake day is special enjoy it! "
<|emo_sad|> So true it hurts.
"<|emo_sad|> It saddens me that [NAME] legacy has become ""Posterboy for edgy manchilds"""
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I wouldn’t doubt that at all. What a crazy situation! Poor woman!! "
<|emo_joy|> Hunting would at least be more rewarding and fun. Every time I wanna meal prep in RDO I just horseback ride and lock-on to deer.
"<|emo_joy|> hhhh, lol "
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] IS SMILING EVERYONE
<|emo_sad|> He was born in Scotland so as much as I’d love him to run it’s not likely.
<|emo_sad|> I'm so depressed
<|emo_joy|> Glad she was a good sport about it.
<|emo_anger|> why wont i just fucking die
<|emo_surprise|> I can’t believe only 3 people pet the cat. Not even the cameraman pet the cat!
"<|emo_anger|> Exactly and the ""they removed it because of historical accuracy"" is bullshit because crossbows were invented way before then."
"<|emo_anger|> Oh [NAME], dont talk about clippers!"
"<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what they'll name it.... I guess Chipper if its a boy, and Chipper if its a girl "
<|emo_sad|> You better be praying for me. I'm living in SO MUCH SIN!
"<|emo_anger|> Not heinous for sure, but frustrating."
<|emo_sad|> sorry. emotional writing bot! you dont know what its like to have an amygdala! lol
<|emo_anger|> That's probably the price a [NAME] pays to rent the Trump Hotel D.C. Ballroom for a cocktail party. Whoop de fucking doo.
"<|emo_joy|> its ok, glad i watched the show, i enjoyed it."
<|emo_disgust|> That's an attitude I currency can't get behind.
<|emo_fear|> I'm kinda afraid to ask but did anyone reply?
<|emo_anger|> Correct What the fuck is the AAF is what im asking.
<|emo_sad|> >![NAME]. Apologies to the Hiyoko Best Girl gang but I could never get myself to like her...!<
<|emo_sad|> It’s a cruel thing to say to someone with depression.
<|emo_disgust|> The more you wind me up the worse it gets for her later on
<|emo_joy|> They’re words and they’re hilarious
"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah, but nobody takes McD's hamburgers seriously. "
"<|emo_sad|> If people think that the current migrant/refugee crisis is ""bad"", they have seen nothing."
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad I could contribute some positivity! All the best to you and your kids!
<|emo_surprise|> It’s such a horrible argument I’m shocked they still use it.
"<|emo_joy|> Jeter been enjoying the Miami nightlife a little too much maybe, dulled his senses. "
<|emo_sad|> I miss [NAME]
<|emo_disgust|> The cruelest people in the room are a pack of gormless dullards. It's the banality of evil for the 21st century.
"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is not fascist. Heck,she's not even alt-right"
<|emo_anger|> Just get pissed next time he asks and tell him to fuck off Some people just think they can take advantage of people who help them
"<|emo_joy|> Finally, the recognition I deserve. "
<|emo_surprise|> All the time here! Say have kid an ex wife and there poof gone!
"<|emo_sad|> As a former [NAME], I apologize. That’s tough"
<|emo_surprise|> Was getting ready to comment about this one. Was really surprised how much I liked it but can see why it’s not for everyone

"<|emo_disgust|> It's interesting, if this was about invasive food smells in an apartment this conversation probably wouldn't be happening."
<|emo_anger|> What a REPOST! STOP REPOSTING THINGS PEOPLE LITERALLY JUST POSTED.
<|emo_sad|> Sorry I kind of took it like you were flexing on my or my opponents skill or something lmao
"<|emo_joy|> Oh it’s hilarious, but not because of the act, but because of the overreaction of everyone in these threads."
<|emo_sad|> Two goals that are directly the fault of the our defense? I feel bad for [NAME]
<|emo_disgust|> Seeing something like this without the usual “Wii music” is so... odd
"<|emo_surprise|> I am only sharing what my friends said, what their experience was. I found that a bit surprising."
"<|emo_anger|> Honestly just tired of this shit, people who'd rather see us tank than push for playoffs. Literally want us to be the fucking Suns."
<|emo_anger|> Seriously? Where the fuck did that sink come from?
<|emo_disgust|> The humidity in Sydney is worse.
<|emo_disgust|> Hell yeah o/
<|emo_sad|> Sadly I think this is true & maybe this is the incentive adults need to get into action
<|emo_surprise|> WOW THATS SO INTERESTING It happens to me so often that when I hear a new word I anticipate it but it all makes sense now
<|emo_anger|> Disconcerting how much I see this guy’s trash propaganda on my reddit feed
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, well I think that game just aged me 5 years..."
"<|emo_disgust|> Maybe. You're running the risk of the trolley and kids being stuck on the carriage with the mum at the previous station. But hey, free groceries!"
<|emo_disgust|> I hate that. PC is way better for using the internet. I also hate how all the important features for the website missing on phone version.
<|emo_sad|> This draft is one man deep tbh. Not getting Zion would be devastating and a waste of a whole year.
<|emo_joy|> Lol that’s great. Grew up in north jersey and had the opposite experience
<|emo_fear|> I can’t tell who’s wooshing who but I’m afraid to ask by this point
"<|emo_joy|> Welcome back, [NAME]"
<|emo_disgust|> Omfg das a lotta snow. Maybe I'll get to pull out the gas powered snow thrower for the bloody first timeof the season.
<|emo_joy|> Seeing something as beautiful as this just made my day today! Thanks for sharing :)
<|emo_joy|> Wow dan I like being up at 4am....
"<|emo_disgust|> Okay, thanks Discord. ~~I hate it.~~"
<|emo_sad|> Sorry to hear that
<|emo_anger|> The stuff nightmares are made of. Those poor poor timelines.
<|emo_sad|> A mix of useful idiots and active grifters. It's a sad sign of our culture that these people make a living this way.
"<|emo_joy|> Funny enough, I'm a Braves fan from CT whose main football team is the saints... So I don't like this post one bit. "
"<|emo_sad|> They never will until it affects them directly, and by then it's already in the end game for us :/"
<|emo_joy|> I feel the r/thathappened for more than half of the stories posted. But they're fun to read.
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME] is like ""Mine! AALLL MINE HAHAHA"""
"<|emo_joy|> Dude, you made my day. "
<|emo_surprise|> oh my good
<|emo_anger|> You can pull yourself out of it. Fight those urges.
"<|emo_sad|> I'm afraid you're completely correct. Sad, but true."
<|emo_anger|> Everybody betrayed [NAME] [NAME]. I'm fed up with this world.
<|emo_joy|> Good to hear - I am glad you at least have that choice.
<|emo_sad|> Poor thing. Her arm looked stuck in the crutch as she fell. That had to hurt
<|emo_joy|> I’m so glad I have my own car
<|emo_sad|> I’m battling depression and anxiety and having a healthy diet and loosing weight has helped me
<|emo_anger|> Try reading up. Not going to play these stupid games with a butt hurt Meltzer fan boy.
<|emo_sad|> Yikes. I feel sorry for the team that gives him anything above 5.5
"<|emo_anger|> I want to bounce a whole roll of quarters off that ass, holy shit."
"<|emo_joy|> I'm so happy to hear you've recovered. Can I ask: are you able to maintain a healthy, stable romantic relationship?"
<|emo_sad|> Yeah! We should have given him justice by believing in claims with no merit! Yeah. Btw. [NAME] raped me 30 years ago! Get him!
"<|emo_fear|> Please LivePD, we have less than 20 minutes left, let's not spend them wandering through the darkness in Mission."
<|emo_disgust|> Dirty Southern Wankers
<|emo_surprise|> Simon's or the bay. [NAME] makes some merino ones that are unbelievable. They are not cheap though.
<|emo_fear|> So cringy and desperate
<|emo_disgust|> And still our government is not responsible enough to pay its bills. It's rather pathetic.
<|emo_sad|> Very frustrating. And totally the fault of your school’s systems for handling the issue. Sorry you have to deal with it.
"<|emo_sad|> Ooof, I’m so sorry, that is rough."
<|emo_sad|> [NAME]? I really want to but never have. I hear it can help with depression a bit.
"<|emo_anger|> No I don't, but I'm assuming they are true for arguments sake Why is more stress relevant or bad? "
<|emo_fear|> I would stay away from [NAME]. Apparently his injury got infected and will require more surgery/surgeries
<|emo_anger|> the act of using private companies as platforms to push indoctrination is no less vile than state run companies
<|emo_surprise|> Wondering why this hasn’t been made a thing yet 😂
<|emo_sad|> Someone died that day.
<|emo_sad|> Poor [NAME]. Give him some Enfamil. He will feel better soon.
<|emo_anger|> Fuck so obvious
<|emo_sad|> Wasn't there some sort of human Cylon orgy in The Plan or am I misremembering? Because I have bad memories of [NAME] and sexytimes.
<|emo_sad|> The whole point of being an introvert is *going alone*
"<|emo_sad|> Unfortunately for you, no one of importance cares about your absurd views. "
<|emo_joy|> I love it. She really snapped.
<|emo_joy|> Me when I distract the last zombie so my friends can work on the Easter egg without starting the next wave
<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry you felt alone. It's a terrible suffocating feeling of dread. I hope you are feeling better and that you are in good health
<|emo_sad|> I’m so homesick and I come here for photos like this.
<|emo_sad|> Not really cringe. Just sad.
<|emo_disgust|> Thank you [NAME].. Another disaster you created.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, they are actually struggling against the Hawks for 3 full quarters. "
<|emo_sad|> I am so sorry those kind of people make me sick
"<|emo_surprise|> Grew up in the south. When I left for college, I was very confused why people were walking around with smudges on their foreheads for Ash Wednesday."
<|emo_fear|> Looks like the next level of a horror character
"<|emo_anger|> Don't listen to the idiot, we love your posts!"
<|emo_surprise|> Wow that is the exact armor combo i used to use
<|emo_disgust|> She was walking like that shoe was up her butt at the club. So tacky and just nah.

<|emo_anger|> Theres the link I use you stupid fuck get the fuck off my post you fucking shill
<|emo_sad|> so by that logic the right lost its mind about a year ago
<|emo_anger|> Everyone’s freaking out about our OC. Our need for O-line is more substantial imo
<|emo_anger|> Sure. The subject of her video was certainly creepy and obnoxious.
<|emo_disgust|> fuck off. let people enjoy what they want to enjoy when it doesn't impact you.
<|emo_surprise|> I've never heard of this place. I know what we are doing next time we're up there!
"<|emo_disgust|> Honestly thought they were the same thing, thanks for the correction and the expansion of my terrible vocabulary."
<|emo_surprise|> Surprised they aren't already doing this kind of stuff for Zion.
<|emo_sad|> Was expecting a horrifically broken ankle. You have posted the actually unexpected
"<|emo_anger|> You're making me look bad [NAME], while she yells and screams."
"<|emo_anger|> Play stupid games, win stupid prizes... looks like she braced before impact. Probably gets this shit all the time. "
"<|emo_anger|> Crack whores are hooking in broad daylight now, eh?"
<|emo_fear|> That's beyond fucking creepy!
<|emo_anger|> Holy shit!!
"<|emo_sad|> I've had such bad memories, I remember when I remember bad times now! Haha"
"<|emo_disgust|> i swear i've seen this on a poster somewhere at my school, it's awful"
"<|emo_joy|> Yeah, it's pretty funny how incapable most of them are of actual satire and subtlety."
<|emo_joy|> I was actually thinking about that during tonight's episode. I don't think the show would last long without [NAME] though.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I might actually watch this weirdo movie this time. "
<|emo_joy|> The fact that they're flying their drone in the rain gives me anxiety.
<|emo_joy|> Love the new intro song.

"<|emo_anger|> Ugh, he sounds like a slob and you should leave him."
"<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME], dont talk about clippers!"
<|emo_sad|> I regret that I have but one downvote to give.
<|emo_sad|> Dude. Same. That would just be... Devastating.
<|emo_sad|> My favourite pool! Shame I don't live around there anymore
<|emo_surprise|> There is a surprisingly large number of [NAME] who play.
<|emo_anger|> You're pointing at me You pointed first I'm signaling that's not pointing Stop pointing at me!
<|emo_joy|> Mozzarella sticks!
<|emo_surprise|> Good riddance. I'm surprised it lasted that long. [NAME] is trash.
<|emo_anger|> FIRE THE MEDICAL TEAM.
<|emo_sad|> Must be a tough life when all you can think about is sad stories to keep you from enjoying anything.
"<|emo_fear|> It sounds like you’re the one who is afraid of the internet. Relax, bud. You’re on r/cringe "
"<|emo_anger|> Nah, this is actually my cat! He’s just the only other person I know that would eat em"
<|emo_fear|> Absolutely brutal.
<|emo_joy|> In draft I see a lot of enchantress. Even without Enchantress if Lodestone Demolition gets 6 dmg(same as Lightning Strike) I am happy.
<|emo_surprise|> What? I’m not downvoting anything. I feel like you’re coming off a little whiny and paranoid right now... please calm
<|emo_fear|> Yeah it’s the opponents club that should be scared of us! We are REAL MADRID!
<|emo_anger|> You can't just make bold claims like that and provide no evidence.
<|emo_sad|> A mix of useful idiots and active grifters. It's a sad sign of our culture that these people make a living this way.
"<|emo_disgust|> These guys are playing hard to get. Gonna take off my bra, BLAST MY NIPS!"
<|emo_surprise|> I was just in shock when she answered the door for devoin.
"<|emo_disgust|> If she deleted your Snapchat just because you showed up to a bingo, then it seems she's a bit of a bad person"
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is a murderer,a psychopath and he wants just to kill him"
<|emo_sad|> My sentiments.
<|emo_sad|> My mom used to throw tantrums in public. I wanted to crawl into a hole and die when she'd start.
<|emo_anger|> What the hell was that
<|emo_surprise|> Woah. I've been wondering when this kind of a situation would play out. I keep wondering if I'll recognize someone I know on these posts.
<|emo_disgust|> This joke is disgusting and offensive. Dictionaries don't contain proper nouns!
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] and his supporters are the dumbest humans in the fucking galaxy. They should be locked up for their own safety.
<|emo_sad|> What is the chair in the photo? I'm torn between sex toy and torture device.
"<|emo_joy|> No prob, glad you asked the question -- hope the response above helps fast-track folks like you who are interested in donating. "

<|emo_fear|> we are scared on /r/bengals rn
"<|emo_disgust|> Yessir, it gives me the creeps. That boy ain't in Scotland, and that boy ain't right."
<|emo_joy|> Avid Android user here. My Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 is by far the sexiest and fastest phone I have ever had. Such bliss when using it.
<|emo_anger|> Fuck yea!
<|emo_sad|> And that's why he's always injured
<|emo_joy|> That makes it an extra special accomplishment. Yay!
<|emo_fear|> Talking about scary foreign people spreading disease is a classic xenophobic trope. Vile.
<|emo_surprise|> Surprised he didn’t get hit with a random drug test
<|emo_fear|> I’m afraid it will eventually go that way.

"<|emo_joy|> ""A lion never stretches before it hunts."" ... Glad to see he's already on board with Green Bays injury first mindset. "

<|emo_surprise|> Oh. My. [NAME]. I can’t handle this

<|emo_joy|> Welcome! I'm a fellow INTJ-A female. Was also lonely for a long time. :) It's great to feel home!
<|emo_anger|> Motherfucker!!
<|emo_anger|> He must hate you
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] living her best life in Germany.
<|emo_joy|> Uh oh spaghettio

<|emo_disgust|> Yup this game just gets worse and worse
"<|emo_sad|> Wow, you folks sure are salty about losing the midterms! Pathetic?"
<|emo_joy|> The Button was amazingly fun. By far my favourite reddit memory.
<|emo_disgust|> Please stop cussing.
<|emo_anger|> Why would they stop there with like 15 feet of visibility? It clearly isn’t just the truck drivers fault
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is not a smart man. Giving a fraud a fucking card. Like wtf
"<|emo_surprise|> I find porn disgusting and boring, could this be a sign I'm asexual?"

<|emo_anger|> He doesn't He just want to get the F*** out of there.
<|emo_disgust|> How is ot unreasonable. You take responsebility for what you breed. This natalist perversion is disgusting. The product didnt fail you. You failed the product.

<|emo_anger|> Because killing people is wrong?
"<|emo_joy|> Wow! Thanks! We’re working on it! Glad you liked it (this is [NAME], the [NAME] one)... appreciate your support!"
<|emo_anger|> PayPal is fucking pricey. 500 bucks to Mexico cost me 60$

"<|emo_sad|> Did you hear about that old Italian chef? Sadly, he pasta way."
"<|emo_anger|> I honestly would've sued anyway. You could have died, and all you got out of it was a guy fired?"
<|emo_fear|> It still seems dangerous
<|emo_anger|> He thought of it but we don't want his mother's house to be wrecked by the staff.

<|emo_anger|> Every point you make is proven wrong lol. Just stop.

"<|emo_joy|> Shaun Of The Dead is way more comedy than horror, good laughs."

<|emo_joy|> that made me cry tears of sadness and joy at the same time.
"<|emo_fear|> Didn't go, but that's a killer picture."
<|emo_fear|> I don't feel so financially secure
<|emo_fear|> I spend a lot of time worrying about how and why that'll happen to me as I get older.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow you summed it up perfectly. Where can I find one of these rare specimens?
<|emo_fear|> There is something terrifying about petite crazy girls. LOL. The scariest girl in my middle school probably weighed 90 lbs. Everyone was scared of her.
<|emo_joy|> This is what I'm currently dealing with and I'm glad I read this. Nice reminder thank you lol.
"<|emo_anger|> Honestly, State and Revolution is what made me ananarchist."
<|emo_sad|> We're pretty spoiled in Halifax.

"<|emo_anger|> Bloody forking shirtballs! This has to be some kind of ""The Good Place"" / Bad Place repost robomod bullshort. "
"<|emo_anger|> How the hell is that comment ""holding the GM accountable"""
<|emo_joy|> I love going out in treacherous weather. For real.
<|emo_joy|> I think there’s something to the concept that overindulgence in technology contributes to a lack of physical and emotional bonding these days.
<|emo_sad|> Because prostitutes clearly can't be raped or kidnapped. It's so horrifying that our society still believes this.
<|emo_joy|> I’d love it if the Star Wars license was revoked from EA and then Obsidian make another KOTOR game.
"<|emo_surprise|> The UK government's No Deal plan is basically to do exactly what they would do if the withdrawal agreement passes, with some caveats, I believe."

<|emo_sad|> This is painful
<|emo_joy|> Happy cake day u/sneakpeekbot!
<|emo_surprise|> I've never seen him play so hard on defense. This feels different this time is all I'm saying...
<|emo_fear|> I don't drink at all specifically because the next day is sheer terror.
<|emo_sad|> 14 and im quite good at makeupmaxxing and tall so people (especially adults) always tell me i look 16-25 :(

<|emo_surprise|> Oh i had it where whoever you didnt pick becomes the mastermind
<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting. Apt.
"<|emo_joy|> Idk why youre downvoted, executing a manequin seems fun"
<|emo_fear|> The uncanny valley of creepy.

"<|emo_anger|> [NAME], I hate [NAME]."
<|emo_disgust|> .... That literally made my stomach clench. I can't believe they are charged for the samples... Just eww.
<|emo_sad|> I guess I am totally alone but I am really enjoying the audiobook and haven’t had a single complaint. I’m half way through now
"<|emo_anger|> I.e., you don't know what socialism is and what it strives for."
<|emo_surprise|> Oh the irony in the title
<|emo_disgust|> If you look back it is odd that most violent murderers have all eaten taco bell at some point.
"<|emo_sad|> dude,,, same i cried today because i couldn’t go to the gym bc my foot was too swollen to wear shoes lol"
"<|emo_anger|> i dunno, you commit one little genocide and you never hear the fucking end of it"
"<|emo_joy|> $9?! Yeah you git ripped off, hope you kept the receipt pal r/sarcasm"
<|emo_surprise|> Surprised [NAME] didn't add his hatred of interracial couples in the movie.
<|emo_disgust|> At SkyZone with the kid getting some energy out. Next up is a dentist visit...ugh
<|emo_disgust|> Because in some cases parents are basically having their own children kidnapped and held against their will and forced into these programs. This is child abuse.
"<|emo_joy|> I'm glad you have your kids, but have you seen Brooklyn 99 like the op stated? It's worth living for too."
<|emo_joy|> No worries! Hope you enjoy it as much as I have! :)
"<|emo_sad|> Man, this analogy is frighteningly spot on. Makes me sad for the province."
<|emo_joy|> I'm happy for you. May you and the boys have many happily ever afters!
<|emo_sad|> Not an awful offer but I don't know if I see AD promising to resign long term in Dallas.
<|emo_anger|> Especially mean! I’m with you. I like the funny posts but people use social media as an excuse to just be horrible people
"<|emo_sad|> Alternating between verbal abuse and neglect, nice. Why aren't you rushing to make this man a grandfather and include him more in your life? /S"
"<|emo_anger|> yeah [NAME] can eat glass, that guy fuckin sucks"
<|emo_fear|> By the way the dogs also alerted at kuss road but will just ignore that much like [NAME] did lol ciao

<|emo_fear|> [NAME] is pretty fucking scary
<|emo_disgust|> It feels oddly comforting and familiar that we suck at hockey again.
"<|emo_joy|> Cheers, I live minutes away from you, will check it out some time soon."
<|emo_sad|> It’s also dangerous to be riding a motorcycle waiting behind a stationary car if another car isn’t paying attention and slams into you.
<|emo_fear|> That ice is dangerously thin for such a hot take.
"<|emo_disgust|> I used to hate them too, but since vikendi I’ve gotten pretty used to them "
"<|emo_disgust|> Woke up feeling smug that I am off until Wednesday... Then I saw all the text messages, emails, and Skype messages. Fuuuuuuck. "
<|emo_sad|> Definite Fridge Horror moment for that movie. That poor man.
<|emo_anger|> But once again that is a problem with the people. So many just attack the people who disagree instead of the arguments.
<|emo_surprise|> Because his reconnaissance is not unique in any way. Literally everyone who saw that movie thought that was surprising.
<|emo_anger|> Damned straight.
<|emo_sad|> Youve missed everything.
<|emo_fear|> I heard the same thing after she had made false allegations and tried to hoover me back . Its so triggering now .

"<|emo_sad|> yep, I witnessed a broken blood vessel in the eye from stifling a sneeze"
<|emo_disgust|> Shamelessly stolen from
<|emo_joy|> Gang beast is really only fun with friends
<|emo_joy|> I was there in 89-91. Some of the best years of my life.
<|emo_joy|> Lovely day we're having.
"<|emo_sad|> That’s sad, although I’m aware they historically haven’t been weaned off of authoritarianism."
<|emo_joy|> Aw thats so sweet A loving cimmunity is what [NAME] and [NAME] deserve for giving us such amazing content every day
"<|emo_joy|> Me and friends just got Vermintide 2, and it isn't an MMO but it solves a lot of MMO problems we had. Quite fun so far."
<|emo_disgust|> Do your research. Not going to engage in conversation with you any longer. Put your Nintendo away and educate yourself.
"<|emo_joy|> ah, it does me heart good to see NIMBYs in the wild"
<|emo_joy|> I very happy with my character. I took my sweet ass time picking one that I liked.
<|emo_joy|> Welcome to the new normal.

"<|emo_anger|> If she deleted your Snapchat just because you showed up to a bingo, then it seems she's a bit of a bad person"
<|emo_joy|> Happy New Year to you too!
"<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry to hear, come see me when you die."
"<|emo_joy|> Glad you enjoyed man, yeah it was pretty spontaneous too, I was praying I wasnt about to pull some bartard move and get jammed lol."

"<|emo_joy|> Happy Cake Day Ph_Dank! Today is your day. Dance with fairies, ride a unicorn, swim with mermaids, and chase rainbows."
"<|emo_sad|> In like 5 years, your entire high school career will be one entire cringe. Congratulations. "
<|emo_surprise|> Wow - never seen negative karma before I clicked on your name lol.
<|emo_surprise|> Using Vtrigger and Vskill buttons!? Oh My.
<|emo_anger|> Hot damn.
<|emo_anger|> Who brings a gun to a middle school in the first place? This kid was not right.

<|emo_joy|> Thanks so much for taking the initiative to do this! Not all heroes wear capes :)
"<|emo_joy|> Wow, thanks so much for me to own tool that I can speak and understand Japanese fluently enough."
<|emo_joy|> And I laughed
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] just make one shot and we’ll be happy
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] saved by the very compassion in society that he is trying to destroy.
<|emo_sad|> Oops! The bottle was so oily it slipped outta my hand and into the trash!
<|emo_joy|> So many nice things here. Good vibes. Enjoy your cake day and weekend. ✌
<|emo_fear|> Scary. I bet youre fun at parties.
<|emo_joy|> Have fun.
<|emo_joy|> I didn’t say for how long I’d been in it. :) Maybe it was made of ply board and garbage!
<|emo_anger|> Your link won't load and are you seriously citing fucking Syria as a successful example of anything? [NAME] holy motherfucking pecker.
<|emo_sad|> literally I feel like crying
"<|emo_joy|> Man, this just gets funnier even after seeing it for the 30th time in the last month! /s"
<|emo_sad|> If you really think a horror movie needs jump scares then I feel bad for you son.
"<|emo_joy|> Hahaha, that's true for all their series."
"<|emo_anger|> ""There's always a bigger fuckup."""
<|emo_fear|> > Imagine the ~~nightmare of regulation~~ flood of unregulated money these guys are up for- congrats.
<|emo_sad|> Bad defensive move by [NAME] there
<|emo_anger|> Fuck her. I hate her so much. I wish she’s just vanish back to Indonesia with her mustache.
"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], what? That's pretty hilarious and disgusting. "
"<|emo_joy|> I mean, even happy-in-love, definitely-did-not-settle type couples still get divorced. It can go either way."
<|emo_anger|> HR is there to protect the company. Not you.
"<|emo_joy|> Hyde Park was beautiful this morning, frosty grass and the morning sun just catching the trees enough to make them glow. "
<|emo_joy|> we got good at breakaways!!
"<|emo_sad|> I actually rooted for you guys that Seahawks game, but now I feel the true pain. "
<|emo_joy|> Just got back from Orlando to Chicago yesterday. I have a good feeling about this one!
<|emo_surprise|> Oooooooh!!
"<|emo_fear|> I'm not saying the dog might hurt her, im saying she might not know when it is appropriate to have the dog degend her"
<|emo_surprise|> Venezuela has uniquely terrible oil.
"<|emo_disgust|> Oh look another stupid comment, original but not unexpected."
<|emo_surprise|> Omg the hockey god’s actually helped us !?
<|emo_sad|> Guilty :( I was ready to cry and everything >:(
<|emo_joy|> Oh that's actually really interesting. So IQ of the general population would be a bell curve by definition?
<|emo_joy|> I enjoyed that [NAME] kept saying [NAME] last name wrong over and over.
"<|emo_disgust|> -30°, then again I'm only 16. Been a while since these temps have come around so it's not pleasant."
<|emo_sad|> Ok sure that’s a nice unfounded opinion you’ve got there. Unless you’ve been in one in which case wow sorry
"<|emo_joy|> Man I am so happy for [NAME], they are selling out. Personally there is no way I would be able to afford them for 38$"
"<|emo_fear|> I'm sorry you had a bad experience, that's horrible. But that number saved one of my friends lives. Different for everyone"
<|emo_surprise|> Why? You can tell me all about it.
"<|emo_surprise|> > bad ass-friend *** ^(Bleep-bloop, I'm a bot. This comment was inspired by )^xkcd#37"
<|emo_fear|> Well.... it’s even more weird to drink the milk of other species..so...
<|emo_disgust|> Not admitting you like something because some of the fan base sucks is pretty pathetic.
"<|emo_disgust|> You’re right, this is absolutely terrible"
<|emo_disgust|> You come off as very cold and uncaring there.
"<|emo_disgust|> I am truly sorry for you because that ""song"" is so awful"
"<|emo_fear|> Yeah that’s one of the things I’m most worried about, still hopeful!"
<|emo_anger|> Good thing I don't give a shit.
"<|emo_disgust|> ""I refuse to argue with anyone born before 1980: They don't even know how to rotate PDFs"" That is exactly how this stupid argument sounds"
<|emo_disgust|> Well it would have been ugly tonight without him. And many nights.
<|emo_surprise|> Ohhh I didn't catch that :P
<|emo_joy|> This is incredible. I love this album so much. Everybody wants to rule the world is so good.
<|emo_anger|> Found the selfish and shitty anti-vaxxer in the thread. How many of us have to die before you get your fucking kids vaccinated?
<|emo_disgust|> That is so sad. So your sisters got to ruin their bodies and forego a career? Yikes.
<|emo_anger|> What in the actual fuck are these refs doing right now.
"<|emo_disgust|> It's like Guatemala, but instead of the US it's Mexico... disgusting "
"<|emo_anger|> Yeah it is, I hate it so much, I wish I woke up earlier."
<|emo_surprise|> The internet never ceases to surprise
<|emo_anger|> I read fuck and not tuck. Was wondering how the hell it wasn't creepy....
<|emo_joy|> The best thing about a traffic jam on 59 is getting out of it
<|emo_joy|> Enjoy the ride!
<|emo_anger|> > it will not make her look like an idiot It would be hard to make her look any more like an idiot than she already does.
<|emo_surprise|> That's... pretty unexpected actually.
<|emo_anger|> Making a woman feel uncomfortable is harassment and trying to flirt without a sign of interest just makes women uncomfortable
<|emo_surprise|> Omfg. I meant [NAME]
<|emo_surprise|> Sounds like my kind of place.
<|emo_anger|> Now ask me if I care. It's irritating and stupid.
<|emo_fear|> I thought this was a torb skin and I was about to die
<|emo_joy|> That was fun
"<|emo_joy|> Firm, but gentle. Baby hamsters or live goldfish. Soft female hands caressing my balls is a wonderful feeling. "
"<|emo_surprise|> Holy fuck, no wonder the turtle beat the hare"
"<|emo_anger|> Sir, you have been warned. You antagonistic attitude will not be tolerated. Please try harder at being a model citizen. Thank you for your cooperation."
<|emo_joy|> Now we play the waiting game.
"<|emo_joy|> Another day, another destiny! "
<|emo_sad|> My organs love me. I wonder how emotionally damaged a person has to be to come up with these. It's weird and sad.
<|emo_disgust|> This is one of the dumbest things I’ve read on reddit this year.
<|emo_anger|> Makes no sense. What the hell are you trying to achieve ? Sound like a dumho
<|emo_sad|> YES! Especially when I’m high 😭 spent like over $500 in December alone
<|emo_anger|> Adapt or die.
"<|emo_disgust|> Not having social media is such a blessing for me, it’s weird he messaged your mum though! I bet she loved hearing from him! "
<|emo_anger|> Don't you fucken do it
<|emo_sad|> pretending the issue is your wife cheating on you is why you're not learning anything
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if the school closures with MLK holiday reduce the priority to plow ...
<|emo_sad|> Break ups are painful and there’s no way to avoid that. Be honest with your current girl and end it.
<|emo_joy|> Thanks. That makes me feel a little less lazy and a little more responsible
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry to hear that, mate. Please get some professional help. "
<|emo_anger|> You commie bastard
"<|emo_joy|> To that I say, you're welcome to get in my pants as long as I'm not in them too... 😁"
<|emo_surprise|> This is the most perfect thing I've ever seen. So many layers
"<|emo_disgust|> You know, 4 months of use is basically nothing though. In that case the bad part of the deal is Nvidia's decision to start supporting freesyinc "
<|emo_sad|> You've been banned from /r/chicagobulls
<|emo_joy|> I unfortunately can not afford a lawyer. Luckily the only thing that we shared is our daughter
<|emo_fear|> I graduated in 2002 and had history books that ended with [NAME] 2nd term. I had great teachers but terrible materials.
"<|emo_joy|> Cheers, I enjoyed your announcers. Sucks we don't get to play again until next year"
<|emo_joy|> Glad to hear it has kept going strong. And employed your dad for that long.
"<|emo_anger|> That will catch up to him eventually, but right now he is dangerous"
<|emo_joy|> Happy cake day 🎂🎂🎉
<|emo_sad|> It didnt last long sadly
<|emo_surprise|> Had a stroke reading these.
<|emo_anger|> SIGN HIM NOW GASE
<|emo_anger|> I've been playing for years and it's still a bitch for me to lay off balls.
<|emo_disgust|> This is one of the worst I've seen...
"<|emo_joy|> Hey, don’t complain. I have 4 and I’m like “so you’re saying there’s a chance!” 😂👏🏼"
"<|emo_sad|> Yep, unprepared for first period, forgot my pants while wandering around the school, etc. Been teaching 5 years and I still get these dreams"
<|emo_surprise|> Doesn't look like any 12 year old I've ever seen.
<|emo_surprise|> Damn....
<|emo_anger|> > What? I second this
<|emo_joy|> That would be me lol; glad it made you laugh
<|emo_anger|> he is a very dangerous man
<|emo_fear|> Better stay out of trouble or they might send you off to a jihadi madrasah girls school
<|emo_sad|> I don’t understand the point you’re making sorry
<|emo_fear|> Since when can a family member drive against other familymembers because you both own it? That would go horrible if that argument was valid! What the hell!
<|emo_joy|> My blood pressure Edit: I'm just happy to be here.

<|emo_joy|> football is my best cope. its like chess to me
"<|emo_fear|> The one on the left looks weirdly suggestive and it creeps me out, you did better with yours"
<|emo_joy|> That’s cool. I didn’t know they had cameras like that. Thank you for sharing :)
"<|emo_anger|> It's 57% upvoted, which pretty much means most people hate it. "
<|emo_disgust|> It feels like it plays worse tbh
<|emo_joy|> I'm slightly ashamed to say I thought that was what the title implied too. Glad that's not the case
<|emo_sad|> All i see is a guy that’s fine stealing beats from his own farm
"<|emo_sad|> Not sure, but if so that is unfortunate. I really liked their cheese bomb deep dish. =["
"<|emo_anger|> Glad you didn't add some awful ""Read that again."" in the description like I see other people doing when they retell this joke."
<|emo_surprise|> Cant you just say no when it doesnt feel right? Sleeping in same bed can help heal...after the initial shock is passed.
<|emo_sad|> Very sad. It’s the child I feel for most.
"<|emo_joy|> Very cool toys, very cool video, very cool hostd"
<|emo_joy|> I had the biggest smile!
"<|emo_surprise|> Jitter mod SG12 has been a thing for awhile now, it's a wonder you're just now seeing it. "

<|emo_joy|> Les Collines (Never Leave You) is still a bop. I loved that song and is still awesome in 2019.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, never knew about [NAME] and I thought I was well-read!"
"<|emo_joy|> Haha, then i am in... :)"
"<|emo_sad|> She later drunkenly slipped on her puddle, fell onto the tracks, and was run over. RIP"
"<|emo_anger|> Fuck it, it's every man/woman for themselves in this fucked City. I've given up caring."
"<|emo_anger|> ""Oh, how DARE you discuss the disgustingly unhealthy and dangerous lifestyle I pursue!"" /s"
<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit! Did not see that coming! Gonna miss you [NAME] :(

"<|emo_joy|> Someone made this album, dwights a bit lanky but I enjoyed it. "

"<|emo_surprise|> Me, joining in everyone in the room saying it when she appears...."
<|emo_surprise|> Right? He actually came across as level headed and mature here so that was a shock.
"<|emo_joy|> take up english sometime, you might enjoy it."

<|emo_joy|> Having fun fighting that strawman? Let me know when you're done.

<|emo_disgust|> Yep. In Sixth grade a boy named [NAME] just stabbed me in the stomach with a pencil.
"<|emo_sad|> I love it. This made me smile so much, which is a big change from [NAME] which made me cry and further increase my depression."
<|emo_anger|> My goodness. Your such a fucking manchild.
<|emo_anger|> Where the f are you going to school that you are hearing such remarks semi regularly? That's horrible!
<|emo_disgust|> that's like a kel'thuzad/kael'thas wet dream right there. Line them up for disgusting aoe XD

<|emo_joy|> it’s what i would have wanted if i was a parent so yeah i’m glad i did something
"<|emo_disgust|> r/mildlyinteresting's stupid ""guys look at this thing I made aren't I cool??"" posts are the absolute worst"

<|emo_disgust|> Thats pretty lewd.
<|emo_surprise|> You're telling me you don't get excited when you see a big hit or players drop the gloves?
"<|emo_anger|> You're a freak, you dirty dog you."
<|emo_anger|> You are not intereating. You are an annoying cunt who should have never been concieved.
<|emo_surprise|> This is the dumbest post I've read today. How's that?
"<|emo_sad|> > It's upsetting. What can be done? We'll have to take it to the high courts, let them decide!"
<|emo_surprise|> I'm suprised I didn't see more of these. Thanks for the support :)
<|emo_fear|> People are often too afraid to speak out against the status quo though.
<|emo_sad|> If men were that aggressive we’d be arrested and then slammed publicly and socially. Lives ruined for a moment of drunken stupor.
<|emo_surprise|> Omg does anyone have a video of this
"<|emo_disgust|> Bruh, I’ve been getting this tough love since I was 18. Hence the dusty balls. "
<|emo_fear|> BP can bulwark counter A good number of deflects and even drop attacks We have more than that to worry about

<|emo_surprise|> Goddamnit [NAME] back at it again...
<|emo_sad|> I must be getting old. Much more likely to be horny at 2 pm.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] got a serious case of the giggles today.
<|emo_surprise|> I wondered where the quote about “supporting your azz” and was very pleased to finally find the train wreck that said it.
"<|emo_anger|> Great, petty revenge instead of making your GF happy by removing [NAME] from her life, nice job!"
<|emo_joy|> hello there¡ That one time i said i liked sex.

"<|emo_disgust|> Most men who gtow have had relationships in the past that turned out to be disasterous, and now they're just salty about women."
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder why! :/
"<|emo_sad|> Kids are curious and brutal. If she actually spoke in front of the class about, she'd probably leave crying."
<|emo_sad|> When he put his legs on either side of the crocodile I thought to myself “man you still have time to change your mind” but alas.
<|emo_fear|> But it's especially tough when its state-owned oil. A lot of Scandinavian countries had hiccups.
<|emo_joy|> This makes me happy. Happy new year everyone
<|emo_anger|> I guess a bunch of people will move over there to avoid Brexit.

<|emo_fear|> It's been feeling strangely like November the last few*****
<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow!!!
"<|emo_anger|> It's not conceited at all. We artists put fragments of ourselves into our work, either intentionally or otherwise. You have every right to be upset. "
<|emo_anger|> How dare u/Reijka92 disrespect [NAME] like that!
<|emo_surprise|> You think this really happened?
<|emo_anger|> Be careful with this. This is the same rationale lots of people used to hate on the Covington students.
<|emo_fear|> Man being unattractive in appearance has pretty much taken any joy out of my life
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] was the worst Of any sports team Unis!!!
<|emo_sad|> If that mask could talk it would beg someone to end it's suffering.
"<|emo_fear|> To be fair, they did call it a horror. "
<|emo_anger|> What they are doing is called Parent Annihilation. Courts take that very seriously.
"<|emo_disgust|> Never made it through, it makes me physically ill just seeing images of that monster combined with him describing his incomprehensible evil."
"<|emo_joy|> I really hope we see another fighter like him he was so fun to watch, a fighting machine with that killer instinct"
<|emo_joy|> Thank you so much. ❤ I'm going to be okay.
<|emo_anger|> I only remember her getting flamed by Thooorin yikes
<|emo_anger|> Why does everyone keep assuming that we’ll suddenly sign big name FA’s? This is a terrible idea.
<|emo_disgust|> If [NAME] is lurking here it's probably definitely not good for his issues
"<|emo_sad|> RIP [NAME], you were a sweet girl. It's been over 10 years but I still miss you."
<|emo_sad|> Here in America too. Those counter protesting fascist get thrown in jail and pepper sprayed like animals. It makes no sense that this happens.

<|emo_fear|> I’m to scared to tell them :(
<|emo_anger|> He should be banned from the nfl. I can’t get behind this.
<|emo_anger|> fat people want to be oppressed so badly. I guess it's because they need an excuse to emotionally eat.
"<|emo_sad|> Nah, I know why I am depressed, and I'm sorry to say it has nothing to do with you. "
<|emo_joy|> My favorite one that you’ve made so far haha Great work
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] looked so lost for 3 quarters. No pocket awareness. Terribly inaccurate. I hope this version of [NAME] is here to stay.

<|emo_surprise|> 23 minutes! Omg that's too long

"<|emo_fear|> For ""on the surface he looks calm and ready"" evil [NAME] would work "
<|emo_fear|> Sir that is a popular opinion. I'm too afraid of what sort of trade will happen to want one.
"<|emo_anger|> Not good idea, unless you mean ""money"" as gold. She would ruin it with inflation."
<|emo_surprise|> Yep. And if the reaction to the CovCath psyop is any indication there will be riots when her retirement or death is announced.
<|emo_disgust|> She looks like one of my exs always feels weird seeing her about
<|emo_surprise|> I had forgotten it was coming up until I saw this. That us my level of excitement and anticipation.

<|emo_joy|> [NAME] lol. I eat what I want.
<|emo_anger|> Or minor son - this news is about two female chiefs being accused of molesting two male trainees.

"<|emo_joy|> For me, she looks happy and nervous as well to meet to her future husband´s family."
<|emo_disgust|> The bot did its job. It’s me the awful one

<|emo_sad|> You win the poverty Olympics.
<|emo_anger|> It’s called concern trolling. Don’t be so gullible and quick to politicize everything.
<|emo_surprise|> I’m surprised that any of this is considered that big of a deal. At least he wasn’t molesting little kids.
"<|emo_surprise|> Hmm surprised that went on for as long as it did, at some point there must have been some redeeming qualities. "
<|emo_surprise|> I don't care about [NAME] story but I surprisingly found myself liking Bristol's.

"<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if we need to find a way, as a people, to not be so dependent on the government. "

<|emo_disgust|> This shirt is directly aimed at some very ugly individuals

<|emo_surprise|> Shocking that a fat DnD kid is this self-important. Remarkable.
<|emo_disgust|> He gave his 20 year old ex herpies dumped her and she killed herself. He’s an awful person
<|emo_surprise|> This is dumb. Why is Detroit Lions infiltrating here.
<|emo_anger|> Because its creepy and weird
<|emo_joy|> Why was everyone so happy when he pulled that knife

<|emo_anger|> If you just slam on the brakes and accommodate these assholes they usually don't even realize they've done anything wrong
<|emo_joy|> I'm just glad everything came out okay.
<|emo_joy|> THIS IS THE JOKE
<|emo_joy|> But that jumper looks hella cosy
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] You are freaking fast
<|emo_fear|> He must smell terrible when he sweats. That's honestly pretty gross.
<|emo_disgust|> Being a complete idiot and blocking a road in front of a bar. Which is where most cops tend to hang out trolling for DUIs at 2 am.

"<|emo_joy|> It’s always entertaining watching people in the background semi-dance, while being painfully aware that they’re on camera"
<|emo_sad|> Maybe you were depressed because your place was a mess.
<|emo_disgust|> Underrated comment.

"<|emo_joy|> Forgot he had been sent down and was really confused, but happy about this post."
"<|emo_anger|> Ok, thats my thinking too. If [NAME] really only gets 180 anyone who didn't make that deal (like us) is pretty dang foolish."
"<|emo_joy|> OMG, my two favorite franchises and the two best girls!!"
"<|emo_joy|> Bruh, fake music was the fucking best, wish we could go back."
<|emo_joy|> *Hey just noticed..* it's your **6th Cakeday** ThaJarseff! ^(hug)

"<|emo_sad|> Normally yeah but that was my friends first match ever and to encounter such a killer, who was running noed too is kinda disheartening for him"
<|emo_surprise|> OH MY GOD! The PTA has disbanded! Ahh! Ahh! AHHHHH •jumps through window•
"<|emo_joy|> That person my friend, you will remember till the day you die. The simple treasures. "

"<|emo_disgust|> Ha, I just saw that highlight. nasty"
<|emo_surprise|> lol since when do you have to go to a orientation?
<|emo_sad|> He literally laid in pain on the ground after the fight longer than the loser did
<|emo_surprise|> No! My furniture is floating!
"<|emo_sad|> ""Yeeaah, I know you're homeless and all but apartments are actually really boring. My most beautiful memories were all made outside in nature."""
<|emo_anger|> :( bastards
"<|emo_joy|> Yup, he's still one of the strongest turtles in the game though. Eventually you're gonna have to attack."
<|emo_anger|> Wouldn't have it any other way. Fuck my DNA. Fuck nucleotides.
<|emo_sad|> Is this from “Please Like Me”? I loved that show. The last season had me in tears though. Really hard to watch. 😢
<|emo_joy|> He remains the only serve bot I enjoy watching.
<|emo_anger|> I dare each or any of you fuckasses to try and blame [NAME] for this one
<|emo_sad|> Sorry buddy I think that one is permanently dead. :(
<|emo_disgust|> I’m offended that your offended
"<|emo_disgust|> His playstyle is everything that everyone complains about in Wisconsin basketball and is a cocky little shit, I love him. "
<|emo_joy|> There is... use a credit or debit card.... lol it hits instantly I just did it literally last Sunday
<|emo_joy|> I feel like I'm in a yoghurt advertisement announcing how my digestive system is all rejuvenated. Its that wholesome.
"<|emo_anger|> Also, if for some stupid reason you want to pull a move like this, you better shoulder check "
<|emo_anger|> What the fuck who likes cold
"<|emo_disgust|> I'm allergic to the red food dye too, a lot of foods have it in there. it sucks because I adore Swedish Fish candies."
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how many tries it took to get the spacing right
<|emo_surprise|> This is amazing!! I love it!
<|emo_sad|> Scotland aren’t the best team to compare against. On their day the could debatably beat NZ on a bad day they lose to America
<|emo_sad|> Oh well pain depends entirely on how you die
"<|emo_joy|> Well tickle me pink. Thanks for following up, I enjoyed the read."
"<|emo_sad|> I actually rooted for you guys that Seahawks game, but now I feel the true pain. "
<|emo_surprise|> Wow. That went south both times. Wanna try for a third?
<|emo_disgust|> My favorite part of women being in the game is fucking destroying them. Take that femenists
<|emo_anger|> You should braid your pubic hair just to really piss him off
<|emo_disgust|> And the woman dropped her underwear and begged him to fuck her. But in all his MGTOWness he refused.
<|emo_anger|> I am still missing money from a August 2018 withdrawal with no update and no success. Quadriga - give me back my money!
<|emo_anger|> THIS MADE ME CRY
<|emo_surprise|> Does negging ever actually work?
"<|emo_joy|> I love this so much, glad [NAME] made it to San Jose after all"
<|emo_joy|> The idea that fb might be slowly killing mlms out there gives me a glimmer of satisfaction...
<|emo_joy|> That's so frustrating but I'm glad you're all safe.
"<|emo_sad|> I can live with the bad textures, I just want them to fix the glitch that lets you see through them."
"<|emo_joy|> 1 5v5 goal in 2 months is not good anyway you spin it. But pleasure being downvoted by you, enjoy believing in WAR "
<|emo_sad|> They’ve always been bad my guy
<|emo_joy|> No worries. Glad you like it
<|emo_surprise|> Your video fails to show how though?
<|emo_joy|> Right!? I'm glad someone else noticed. I was horrified when she trespassed into a stranger's home. So violating!
<|emo_surprise|> That's a lot of calories!
<|emo_anger|> This is almost as effective as posting that sweet photo of [NAME] old band
<|emo_joy|> I cackled!!!!
<|emo_sad|> You're back but you're still broken.
<|emo_surprise|> It's amazing the people here supporting the [RELIGION] church and the child molesters over duterte... I wonder why.
<|emo_anger|> I would never stay at a hotel that had people ringing a bell at the bar nonstop. Not to mention the gong
"<|emo_sad|> Yes, very sad but that's the reality of competitive online gaming right now"
"<|emo_joy|> I made my own sauce for chicken dishes this week, I am happy, LGD"
<|emo_joy|> You’re only as young as you feel 😄
<|emo_surprise|> So much better that way!
<|emo_sad|> Sadly the minimum wage in Virginia is only $7.25 an hour so that definitely would not be enough.
<|emo_anger|> How dare you disrespect [NAME].
<|emo_sad|> Don't know how that was missed. Tragic really. Considering the title.
"<|emo_joy|> Hey [NAME], I'm [NAME] ! :) "
"<|emo_anger|> I will have nothing to do with this specter, who selectively appears to individuals and abandons others. No better than a cruel warlord."
<|emo_surprise|> I just really don't see 20% for him. I would be very surprised.
"<|emo_anger|> Not to mention the fact, that he's casually smoking a cigarette 3 inches away from an infant."
"<|emo_surprise|> Ahh well if some rando in reddit says something without evidence, that’s good enough for me! International association of medical doctors be damned!"
"<|emo_sad|> No, their reaction was just as bad."
"<|emo_fear|> Ugh I live in WA state and now I'm scared I'm going to get measles even though I'm vaccinated, I hate anti-vaxxers"
<|emo_surprise|> Plenty of Aboriginal blokes on here who criticised [NAME] too.
<|emo_anger|> PUT THEIR BLINDFOLDS BACK ON!!!
"<|emo_disgust|> There is a difference, because unless something had given them encouragement, they'd still be feeling negative about it. "
<|emo_fear|> I’ve never cringed so hard
<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit this speaks to me.
"<|emo_surprise|> Its almost like climate change makes hot places hotter and cold places colder. Jeez, who could have predicted that. "
<|emo_surprise|> Happy cake day to him
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh god, the one common denominator strikes again and is rubbing off on the other players. We're doomed, back to the drawing board in 2020"
"<|emo_joy|> Great post, glad you had a good time here. Xpost it to r/travel. "
"<|emo_surprise|> Can't believe this game actually released in the state it's in complete joke , should be criminal"
<|emo_surprise|> Wauw! Those weapons are awesome!!
<|emo_surprise|> BUT 3 MILLION VOTES!
"<|emo_sad|> Sadly, it was not"
<|emo_joy|> Glad you liked it!
<|emo_joy|> Thats so cool man. Have you tried dmt
"<|emo_joy|> when they finally do eat a decent meal, the will blow up like a balloon!"
<|emo_joy|> Seriously. I had 2 jobs and was in college. I sleep more now!
"<|emo_disgust|> Like the poor redhead in True Blood that got vampired as a virgin, but worse."
<|emo_anger|> Wtf. And then we wonder why people think DnD players are a bunch of fucking creeps. Sucks that you had to bear witness to such sadness.
"<|emo_disgust|> Kids are curious and brutal. If she actually spoke in front of the class about, she'd probably leave crying."
<|emo_sad|> Unfortunately not. 😏
<|emo_surprise|> I cannot imagine being so fragile that being able to smile threatens your identity and world view.
<|emo_fear|> Some additional background the robo-voice on that video is horrible.
"<|emo_joy|> Happy Cake Day! I, too, have been a victim of cake."
<|emo_joy|> Id gladly exchange firsts with the Suns
"<|emo_sad|> Friend of the younger sister of girl who was killed. She told me it was a bad acid trip. Very sad, family is holding a vigil tomorrow night. "
<|emo_fear|> This has to be made as a satire of terrible memes . Like r/okbuddyretard material
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you an asshole much?"
<|emo_joy|> Ok yea running toward him makes it easier good idea
"<|emo_disgust|> No, i'm arguing that if she calls someone disgusting for how they act it's wrong to act like the other person is an asshole for retaliating. "
"<|emo_joy|> I always loved Sunday’s because it was Extreme Homemaker, Desperate Housewives, and then Grey’s Anatomy. "
<|emo_disgust|> Ugh. Gross
"<|emo_sad|> Same thing happened to me but for my dog, stocking up on noodles tomorrow to get through the next month. "
<|emo_disgust|> assault? molest just has a connotation of someone being under the influence or without proper faculties
"<|emo_sad|> Wait, they banned his mother from travelling too? "
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah they taste so fake!!
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] sure are afraid of brown women.

<|emo_fear|> Thanks I was worried that I might die alone
<|emo_anger|> should've rolled into battle with a sword brad. that would have fuckin' rocked
<|emo_disgust|> I hate these cakes so much.
<|emo_sad|> But really Vanilla Ice is scum RIP [NAME] and [NAME]
"<|emo_sad|> Dude, she had just lost her baby, too. "
<|emo_surprise|> Oh jeez!! I didn't know! I retract my message.
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] voice actor by the end of the game was phenomenal. So much rage and sadness
<|emo_fear|> It scares me that left to right is also possible for anyone
<|emo_anger|> I hate betting unders.
"<|emo_joy|> Unfortunately that's a long old way from Sydney, but I'm glad teams don't mind having non playing members "
<|emo_joy|> lol [NAME].
"<|emo_joy|> Glad to hear this gets easier. I want to visit Hawaii, but I've held off to avoid those feelings. Same with Portland sadly. :("
<|emo_sad|> At least you should have helped out since you had rudely interrupted him.
<|emo_anger|> I doubt groot arms are on the list of MLB approved bats. It's politics
<|emo_fear|> I hate watching [NAME] play I can tell before he steps over half when he’s gunna shoot or pass. His BB IQ is atrocious
<|emo_disgust|> I feel terrible for their daughter. I wouldnt want to grow up in between the middle of that.
"<|emo_sad|> I worry about throwing draft picks around, but a guy like that is worth it IMO."
<|emo_joy|> Yep. I'm glad I never did. I'll gladly use their service for free when it suits me and give them nothing in return
<|emo_joy|> Maybe you'll get lucky and it will fall apart before they go through with it.
<|emo_surprise|> I was flabbergasted when I saw it.
<|emo_sad|> Oh my gosh!!!!!! 😂 you poor thing! Thanks for sharing!
<|emo_anger|> Cant wait til [NAME] passes him. [NAME] is an ungrateful mofo. Anyone that praises their own work ethic and hard work needs slapped silly.
<|emo_sad|> At home with a viral infection right now! Praying for death and to the god of paracetamol. Ugh.
<|emo_sad|> I'm going to hold out hope for something minor even though it looked really bad. Just going to wait for the official news.
<|emo_anger|> I can’t imagine having a plan B when it comes to dating. That just seems disrespectful to not devote yourself to the person your dating.
<|emo_surprise|> What did the dyslexic atheist insomniac do last night? He stayed up all night wondering if there was a dog
<|emo_surprise|> Ironic considering the amount of brigading AnComs do on this sub
"<|emo_disgust|> 4 lives essentially, its insane"
<|emo_anger|> You shut your mouth
<|emo_joy|> Hey! I play the lottery every week-this will eventually affect me...
"<|emo_fear|> She already had plans with some of her friends and it would have been weird for me to get there, I didn’t know any of them. "
<|emo_disgust|> That woman is simultaneously very evil and using her evil to make others regret doing evil things.
"<|emo_disgust|> And yet, it’s bad to manipulate people. Which is what the in laws are doing. "
<|emo_sad|> I have two and nothing has ever happened to me. The media doesn't want you to show your support because they want supporters to feel isolated.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] has consistently being volatile. It's just a matter of time until she's being rude to [NAME] again.
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, the show that had [NAME]? Yeah screw him."
<|emo_joy|> I turned the news on around 6 this morning and have never been so happy to have a commute of 4 miles to my job
<|emo_fear|> My parents are going to kill me when they find out.

"<|emo_anger|> The grey shirt guy: ""Oh shoot! I leave the stove on!"""
"<|emo_anger|> Fuckkkkk I'm doing Psychology lmfao, am I gonna fail at life now? "
<|emo_disgust|> He has the maturity of a 2 year old and you are right...ugly in his soul.
<|emo_disgust|> Nothing. Fuck the environment so people can think they saved a few bucks. People are fucking stupid.
<|emo_surprise|> Is that a real tweet? From the actual president? Not a parody? I can't tell anymore.
<|emo_anger|> The fact she'd want her daughter with someone as awful as [NAME] is strange. And what's wrong with [NAME] that she would stay with him ?
<|emo_anger|> Bitch right!
<|emo_joy|> Does your son do Scratch? My daughter doesn't do fortnite but Scratch is her favourite internet thing and she would love to add new scratch friends.
<|emo_fear|> I think the show was all about forgiveness. She can't change [NAME] and fighting with him only brings him around and brings her pain.
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh my god, I'm so glad this wasn't just me. I thought my YouTube was broken!"
<|emo_disgust|> Our education system has been a complete and utter failure...
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah, you get worried sick, imagine them hey slaughtered by Coyotes AND realize it’s all your fault."
<|emo_sad|> That woman is simultaneously very evil and using her evil to make others regret doing evil things.
"<|emo_fear|> Ah sorry [NAME], I was going to join. But your desperate posts scared me away!"
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] will be great. But I will definately miss if she's not there.
<|emo_sad|> you should have asked this question 15 years ago sadly :(
<|emo_joy|> Fucking happy this jerk is still well and alive.
<|emo_joy|> As someone who is about to be 29 this is the realest thing I’ve ever seen.
<|emo_sad|> I want to so bad it hurts. I guess I'm just scared.
<|emo_fear|> Hard to get motivated to play when the fans are burying one of your teammates.
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] became president and yet you think [NAME] becoming president is farfetched? Lol
<|emo_disgust|> that was such a misstep from their PR. wtf were they thinking people were expecting with a public countdown
<|emo_anger|> But he is. He won’t talk to us. [NAME] damnit OP answer us!!
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] gets eliminated the 3rd time she's in the bottom so this is wrong and [NAME] would have the best track record if this is true
<|emo_sad|> Because ridiculously attractive people also have self esteem issues and depression Guess what honey The world sucks for everyone There’s no escape We will all die in misery and alone
<|emo_joy|> Cool! Well I look dumb but I learned something
"<|emo_sad|> we have a ""righty"" complaining about ""lefties"" making up BS, while they make up BS... sad."
<|emo_disgust|> You wanna tap a foetus? Descusting.

<|emo_sad|> **Lost** children. Issues we face today are likely fabricated from the bottom up.
<|emo_disgust|> I hate those days man... So triggering
<|emo_anger|> Looks weirdly fake Edit: turns out it’s real
"<|emo_anger|> Yeah whether or not an animal is cute is pretty subjective, I was just in a bad mood when I wrote the post honestly."
<|emo_joy|> I prefer having the TV in the background more than music. Music is something I enjoy in the car or walking in the city.
<|emo_joy|> I would love to be woken up by that
<|emo_fear|> I have little to no anxiety and it really helps me when i have to take a test.
<|emo_joy|> Ooh I like that one :)
<|emo_surprise|> i love [NAME]. itd be incredible to see her
<|emo_anger|> I'd also report to the post office... and next time these nasty neighbors come-give them the number to call and complain.
<|emo_sad|> I'm so sorry that your partner doesn't understand that you no longer want to put hormones in your body.
<|emo_disgust|> “How dare you use your breasts for their biological function instead of my enjoyment!”
"<|emo_joy|> The few people that survive jumping from bridges say, almost invariably, that they regretted jumping the second they entered free fall."
<|emo_sad|> Sad but true.
<|emo_joy|> Hugs hugs hugs. So many big hugs and good vibes. That's the only thing I know how to say right now.
<|emo_sad|> It's so sad
<|emo_joy|> Thanks! I’m Excited To See How This Meme Become In The Future!

"<|emo_joy|> Oh of course,this bag will still be thoroughly enjoyed . Modern times have just turned me into a snob"
<|emo_sad|> as much as I could tolerate - sadly I gave you a view.

"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, guess my penis is small after all.."

<|emo_sad|> poor [NAME] is in jail now for assassination.
<|emo_sad|> A lack of the romantic partner is the stressful situation in my life.
<|emo_disgust|> Its weird because I didn’t say “house cat” I just said “cat” yet you felt the need to correct me.
<|emo_anger|> Drive thru is the worst. The number of times people would sneeze in my face at the window was infuriating.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that’s fascinating! I’d be interested to know the rationale (or lack thereof) for a [NAME]. "
<|emo_anger|> Oh no! We better stop now...before someone's feelings get hurt!
<|emo_joy|> Didn't even notice until you *pointed* it out. I had a bit of a giggle.
<|emo_anger|> Don't tell me what to do.

"<|emo_sad|> And you're a lame, sorry not sorry "
"<|emo_disgust|> Let's not try to pretend both were equally bad, [NAME] was magnitudes worse"
<|emo_joy|> I was so happy for cowboy

"<|emo_sad|> Sadly, it was not"
"<|emo_joy|> The happiest of birthdays to you, [NAME]!"
<|emo_sad|> The impact of his head hitting the court looked so bad. I hope he'll recover from this.
"<|emo_anger|> >The Charisma Myth"" It's bullshit too."
"<|emo_sad|> Yup, not enough money"
"<|emo_fear|> so lucky. im afraid to tell my [NAME] gf. :"")"
"<|emo_joy|> >[NAME] I don't know why, but that gave me a good laugh. Thank you. "
<|emo_sad|> If I wanted to send a message about how much I hate my life and get literally no response then I could just text my mother.
<|emo_sad|> Oh this poor sap
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is a fucking trooper
<|emo_joy|> Pot meet kettle. I don't enjoy having the last word as much as I enjoy you not having it. It seems pretty important to you.
<|emo_joy|> I prefer a good downdoot after a cup of coffee!
<|emo_joy|> I’m fine with that. I’m happy to be banned from subs like that.
<|emo_joy|> That's my stomach. my plate unfortunately has a boundary
<|emo_surprise|> My 1 year old ate TWENTY TWO broccoli tots for lunch. And he still wanted a cookie afterwards. Like...what?!
<|emo_anger|> She would betray her friends for chicken nuggets
"<|emo_disgust|> This is being said about every fucking update that lowers the skillgap. Yes, it does change the game because we're already affected"
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh my god, zero-calorie Gatorade is a thing ^(i don't care how many chemicals are in it if its zero-calorie)"
<|emo_sad|> North Central exactly... Poor dude's name is [NAME]. Popped right back up and finished the game...
"<|emo_anger|> I'm not vegan cause I love animals, I'm vegan cause I hate myself. "
"<|emo_sad|> That's awful. I'm sorry that you had that experience, but yeah, mission accomplished, sorta."
<|emo_sad|> Yeah the lack of visibility of the survey likely means the survey is gonna be skewed towards people who are extremely online on this sub specifically.
<|emo_joy|> My friend with BPD has just done this very thing when I moved down to their city. Have become a total stranger.
<|emo_joy|> Oh my [NAME]. Yesssss.
<|emo_disgust|> Reacting to [NAME] at this point just makes me feel worse about the artist.
"<|emo_disgust|>  You're lecturing other people and you can't even spell ""Dwig***H***t""."
<|emo_anger|> Swap places? I'd take your place over listening to my father complaining about how Canada's not conservative enough.
<|emo_anger|> That's no excuse.
<|emo_joy|> I love it lol!
<|emo_anger|> Thats awful and Im sorry for your friend. I whole heartedly agree. Its getting out of hand.
<|emo_joy|> Is that how you deal with people you disagree with? Nice personal fantasy you have there.
<|emo_surprise|> >!I mean he did give himself a weird new arm...!<
"<|emo_sad|> This happens to me all the time I’m so sorry 😣 it’s always with burgers, too. So painful. "
"<|emo_disgust|> I may have awful taste, i would want this cake"
"<|emo_sad|> Oof, that's rough. :( Sorry that happened to you, mate. "
<|emo_disgust|> yea so disgusting
<|emo_surprise|> Well that was strangely majestic.
"<|emo_fear|> It's so weird having HGs up this early, but I love having something to watch before my 8am lecture starts."
<|emo_anger|> YOU BLEEPING NEED ME! YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS SUB GREAT WITHOUT ME!
"<|emo_disgust|> Alright dude just fuck off ok, it's not the funniest thing on the internet but it did make me smile so in conclusion fuck you"
<|emo_fear|> These are some of the lamest threatening letters I’ve ever seen. She’s a metahuman who can you murder people with her voice.
"<|emo_surprise|> That looks like before Fox even owned it, I was surprised to see it's almost been 30 years"
<|emo_anger|> The only time this movie should encourage blindfolds is when watching it. Then hopefully you won’t witness the giant plot holes and terrible ending.
<|emo_anger|> I hate [NAME] and [NAME] for what they've done to this franchise. And I'm growing to hate [NAME] as well.
<|emo_sad|> I called an ambulance for my friend without knowing it was against her wishes. She never blamed me but I felt really bad about it.
"<|emo_anger|> Yep. I did this in uni, got mad respect for holding my ""booze"". "
<|emo_joy|> Glad someone brought that up.
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh no here come the fanboys and girls, dude... RUUUNNN"
<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is supee trashy. How did it get to front page?
<|emo_surprise|> I always flew out from Edinburgh. First time flying out from Glasgow and I was shocked at how small and... dingy it felt in comparison.
<|emo_anger|> You look a trashy stripper that brings her kid to work. You also look like [NAME] if she continued taking heroine
"<|emo_fear|> Not the right sub, I'm afraid."
<|emo_joy|> I really love [NAME]
<|emo_fear|> It's this kind of fear that made me make this
<|emo_surprise|> That's literally insane considering we're talking about [NAME] and [NAME].
<|emo_joy|> I always fall for this joke on here..
<|emo_sad|> OMG kids are dying from polio??
<|emo_disgust|> It's not even the ads. It's the complete lack of anything worth watching between the ads.
<|emo_surprise|> Can't believe me and my family were gonna leave five minutes early to beat the traffic. Honestly the best game I've ever seen live
"<|emo_sad|> See that's what I figured, but at the same time academy is such a hindrance 😂"
<|emo_fear|> I honestly predict a riot on the scale of the 2011 ones if we undergo a no-deal brexit - possibly even worse. It's terrifying.
"<|emo_surprise|> Yikes. That’s straight up paranoid, you can tell they were looking through comments for someone to rage at. "
<|emo_surprise|> I know it’s perfectly cooked but something just grossed me out about it. Oh well
<|emo_fear|> Nobody wants to fight the naked guy.
"<|emo_sad|> He was cut yesterday, unfortunately"
<|emo_sad|> That such a sad flop [NAME]
"<|emo_fear|> ...be careful, guys"
"<|emo_sad|> Yup. I feel you. I'm very sorry it happened to you, too."
<|emo_fear|> I feel attacked
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] got a bad report card from [NAME] as well today.
<|emo_disgust|> It's not even the ads. It's the complete lack of anything worth watching between the ads.
"<|emo_joy|> the sky, living a happy and amazing life in the clouds."
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, if I hadn't seen my mom's cat recently I'd think this was him! I hope you find the owners"
<|emo_sad|> That's just sad if it's for a game
<|emo_surprise|> I knew this was a Shitpost before I clicked it. Is this an INTJ thing btw?
"<|emo_anger|> You fool, you have no idea that you talked about team fortress all along!"
<|emo_surprise|> I still can't believe I used to watch [NAME] videos
"<|emo_anger|> And Mac and cheese is shit too. If a grown man has to eat children's food, then STAHMs can get minimum wage jobs"
<|emo_joy|> Happy New year!
<|emo_disgust|> I cant believe we elected this goon
"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, super glue and band aids stat!"
"<|emo_sad|> omg, id cry if this was my store "
"<|emo_joy|> Interesting. Expected them to go with more established names, but glad they didn’t."
<|emo_joy|> Oh wait that's tonight?!?! Totally watching 😎
<|emo_anger|> This is so painfully 80s. I hate it.
<|emo_disgust|> It’s more like a bunch of vaguely veiled racists and sexists and MAGAtards. Unless that’s what you consider “good.”
<|emo_joy|> That is what we love to hear. :) We hope you enjoy the game and that we see you again soon!
<|emo_joy|> I enjoyed the new format but I will say it was strange without the band
<|emo_joy|> I just love the look of most benzos. Bars of course the most. But a handful of 10mg valiums or 2mg klonopin is also mouth watering :)
<|emo_anger|> My goodness. Your such a fucking manchild.
<|emo_disgust|> How dare you put x on the same level as [NAME] and [NAME] [NAME] that's disgusting
<|emo_disgust|> I wasn't digging it and then [NAME] did her spiritual spacewalk. I almost walked out.
<|emo_sad|> things are simply wrong and ignorance is an insufficient defence from prosecution.
<|emo_joy|> Welcome to the Wild West. It's fucking amazing.
<|emo_fear|> Oh my [NAME] please no
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, what a find. The store actually began clapping"
<|emo_anger|> Stop virtue signaling.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I’ve never seen so many deleted comments, and that’s saying something."
"<|emo_surprise|> Dammit, you know I proof read this and I thought it changed correctly but I guess it didn't."
"<|emo_fear|> Same here, i hope my upcoming trip is gonna kill me"
<|emo_anger|> Wow guns and ignorance. What else is wrong with her?
<|emo_sad|> The life of a bus driver is harsh.
<|emo_anger|> I hated broccoli until my parents tapped into my obsession with dinosaurs and got me to pretend I was a brontosaurus
<|emo_surprise|> I was wondering the same thing?
"<|emo_sad|> Eh, loser. It’s sad how some people don’t care about their relatives."
"<|emo_sad|> Why would the landlord pay it if electric isnt included. Sorry to OP, need to cut the heat down"
<|emo_sad|> sorry mr brolobo
"<|emo_sad|> Actually feel sorry for her. She has depression and low self esteem, this is not going to make it better."
<|emo_anger|> #SOMETIMES YOU CAN TELL RIGHT AWAY SOMEONE ISN'T WORTH ANY MORE TIME!
<|emo_disgust|> Favorite: Hardhomme! That epic stare down at the end! Least favorite: No One. Completely ridiculous and unbeleivable
<|emo_disgust|> I'm not being told I have issues by a guy who actually and genuinely has an interest in coprophagia.
<|emo_fear|> And you can amend a tax return. She can’t amend a terrible life choice like that.
<|emo_fear|> Well that’s horrific
<|emo_fear|> That opening is quite terrible tbh
<|emo_joy|> It happened and I'm very happy
<|emo_disgust|> Holy fucking shit
"<|emo_fear|> Everytime I see something in this sub that looks sharp, I get very worried. "
<|emo_sad|> I was living for him. Now he left me. I'm not gonna live anymore.
<|emo_fear|> Scary stuff.
<|emo_surprise|> It’s such a horrible argument I’m shocked they still use it.
"<|emo_joy|> I did, I did!!!! Now I feel special "
<|emo_sad|> Star Wars Episode IX: We’re Sorry Please Come Back We Fixed It
"<|emo_sad|> Sadly, I don't have insurance so unless I'm bleeding out I won't be getting medical help."
<|emo_joy|> OK. caitoz is an [NAME] shill and closely aligned with Russia. Enjoy irony!
<|emo_anger|> Oh [NAME] how awful
<|emo_fear|> I don’t know anything about Israeli politics except that [NAME] is awful and I hope he loses.
<|emo_sad|> Sorry for your loss. My bestfriend is turning 13 soon and I'm trying to cherish every minute we still have.
"<|emo_anger|> Liberal circlejerk “ o ya those conservatives suck” 10,000 upvotes"
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow- some truly have crazy different genetics. I’m glad you got her a friend, I’m sure it helps immensely. "
<|emo_joy|> Happy for u!!
<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry. Does Scholomance exist in the World of Ice and Fire?
"<|emo_disgust|> Then they're the worst fascists of all time, because their critics have been extremely loud and public, while not being murdered."
<|emo_anger|> Angry old men raise their canes when angry. Raising Cane's is a fast food chicken finger chain.
<|emo_anger|> Its ok we all know you suck scrub.
"<|emo_disgust|> wow it’s literally disgusting that you’re getting downvoted for pointing out that she abuses her kids. this is the society we live in, eugh"
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] that was so awful I collapsed into a singularity
"<|emo_fear|> I feel terrible but I do this too, or watch obese people doing mukbangs"
"<|emo_surprise|> Didn't expect him to land back in the championship, although mears was much more unlikely"

<|emo_anger|> You die.
"<|emo_sad|> If it was communism, the poor lad would be killed"
<|emo_anger|> I read this while taking a sip of tea. Bad idea
<|emo_disgust|> It's so much worse with a child involved. I'm so sorry you have to go through this.
<|emo_surprise|> I really love the sorta sharp angles you used !
"<|emo_joy|> I love his reaction. ""That was amazing"""
"<|emo_anger|> Good job, white truck! Don't use the damn shoulder to pass!"
<|emo_fear|> The faces in that drawing are kinda horrifying
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME]. When my ex and I discussed baby names, I feel in love with this combo"
<|emo_sad|> Occupation badges are dumb and I’m sad they made the transition to OCP.
"<|emo_joy|> My entire family is Buffalo fans, it's all I've heard about this week"
"<|emo_anger|> Take your upvote, you no good bastard."
<|emo_sad|> Yeah but being president is the only thing keeping him from being indicted so he’s kinda stuck.
"<|emo_anger|> Dont worry guys, its all sanitary. He hit the wrench with some WD40 before he started."
<|emo_surprise|> wondering what the hookup scene is like in the north woods of Wisconsin?
<|emo_anger|> And you didn't read the filler did you?
<|emo_anger|> your first mistake was trying to make something look presentable while serving it in a tupperware
<|emo_surprise|> I reported an old man for terrible driving and the police actually took it seriously (pleasantly surprised). It's worth a try!
<|emo_surprise|> Surprised Colorado ain’t got one the way things have been going here past couple years
<|emo_anger|> Your ass after I beat you so hard you shit yourself

<|emo_anger|> I think it should be a felony. Kind of crazy that illegally entering a country is such a minimal offense.
<|emo_anger|> Removed? Damn no respect.
<|emo_joy|> This is the first time I’ve ever been reposted. I’m honored
"<|emo_joy|> I think thats the point, this screams irony. Like r/comedyheaven brand"
"<|emo_anger|> Sew up that cockholster son, no one gives a fuck."
<|emo_sad|> I quit soda about a month ago and this makes me want to go buy an entire 2-liter just to comfort myself
<|emo_surprise|> It surprises me that he's a mod some days...
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad we agree.
<|emo_joy|> The Imperial is the best gay bar in Sydney. PERIOD.
<|emo_joy|> Funny how you're implying he'd even have a chance against [NAME]
"<|emo_joy|> OK sweaty, have fun in ur collapsing Union while I'm restoring the Empire xoxx"
<|emo_surprise|> This guys still alive?
<|emo_fear|> I have that problem myself sometimes.

<|emo_joy|> Organizational Change Manager and I fucking love it and have for 7 years. Still enjoy going to work every day.
"<|emo_sad|> Nah she's just a dull asari doctor, with a pleasing voice."
<|emo_anger|> Burn it!
"<|emo_joy|> Good times, good timessss lol"
<|emo_disgust|> U dumb.
<|emo_fear|> The dude was absent in the Ohio State game... IDK I would be very worried if he was the pick.
"<|emo_sad|> Such a good story. Im now a grown man, crying at work... on reddit."
<|emo_disgust|> This would be completely ludicrous. Turkey can literally just drive tanks over these guys if they want.
<|emo_fear|> Same. I unfollowed the cast and the fan pages. I can’t anymore lol
<|emo_joy|> Couldn't have said it better. Just did the same over my winter break and really got to know myself a lot better. Cheers to the new year!
"<|emo_joy|> Yea, I saw him live in Stockholm. It was awesome!"
<|emo_joy|> I would think I was in a horror movie and lock the doors. Lol
<|emo_joy|> Surely a ferry could be more cost effective and fun than that.
"<|emo_joy|> I am real excited for this, I just hope they don’t ruin it."
<|emo_joy|> Good to know ED either doesn’t affect this guy or he’s projecting hard because it’s the worst thing he can try to handle
"<|emo_joy|> I did! Never moving back, I love my life in the ""big smoke""."
<|emo_disgust|> Booping can be dangerous though.
"<|emo_surprise|> This is the first I’m hearing of this. Not on any of the local news, but on Reddit! MASSIVE media bias."
<|emo_joy|> It’s not so much that I enjoy money and more that I do enjoy scamming people.
<|emo_anger|> Plus there's this expectation/trope of flowers sent to workplace being a way for someone who's fucked up to apologize (which is icky as hell but whatever)
<|emo_sad|> So you'll bleed and be in pain twice that day.
<|emo_joy|> 1k followers on Twitter. Seem to have no sponsors. Not looking good
<|emo_sad|> Not [NAME]. He really didn’t seem like the Canuck players that played with him missed him at all.
<|emo_disgust|> How the fuck do you moan tho
<|emo_anger|> #I HATE BOTH EQUALLY
"<|emo_sad|> I am truly sorry for you because that ""song"" is so awful"
<|emo_sad|> Same here. The critical sign and the little chevron only shows up.
<|emo_sad|> This makes me want to die
"<|emo_fear|> Late-stage Reddit. I'm afraid it's malignant, there are only palliative care options available at this point."
<|emo_anger|> I still don’t understand what did [NAME] do? Lol
"<|emo_fear|> I'd say the bigger potential problem is getting reported for public indecency, that goes on your criminal record."
<|emo_sad|> i got a bump and a bald spot. i feel dumb <3
<|emo_sad|> I have endured worse.
<|emo_joy|> I loved [NAME] as a little kid but I wanted jean's powers but I couldn't stand how goodie goodie her and [NAME] were.
<|emo_sad|> I’m doing married. Sorry.
"<|emo_disgust|> I know, that's why I said one of the reasons. The main reason is his uselessness when your team is bad"
<|emo_anger|> First of all how DARE you plague this country with your USELESSNESS you degenerate smh
<|emo_joy|> Congrats! Glad it went well for you!
"<|emo_disgust|> Except [NAME], he somehow defies any common sense and sometimes he comments here."
"<|emo_joy|> I, too, am a lot of fun at parties. We can stand together in the corner! "
"<|emo_anger|> Bore off, you pearl-clutching, centerist coward. "
<|emo_anger|> This really tickled my anxiety. I hate it
<|emo_disgust|> Pant full of turd.
<|emo_joy|> She has no idea. You've got this ♡
"<|emo_anger|> WHAT?! You dare insult the band of gods?! Typical teen, I hate my own generation! *screams in 16 year old*"
<|emo_surprise|> You were shot by a Vigilante!
<|emo_disgust|> They are dumb 43 / 37 year olds.
<|emo_disgust|> You give me too much credit... That comment is as trash as the meme
"<|emo_anger|> see, i'm over here thinking ""i hate sports"" now if you could just take my balls and go home"
"<|emo_sad|> Please be [NAME]. I like [NAME], for the record. But I'm def willing to part ways with him. "
<|emo_anger|> This is horribly disgusting. It's worse than the god damn chicken wire.
<|emo_surprise|> Let me add to them - it was awesome. Also unexpected!
"<|emo_disgust|> You’re right. My biggest pet peeve is the lights, it washes out all the colors and textures, I hate that BGs use them"
"<|emo_sad|> Honestly if I didn't have this many favorite characters not yet in the game, I would probably waste my 7 votes on Merlinus."
<|emo_surprise|> Aww man. And I just came up with a great shitpost I mean idea....
<|emo_sad|> sadly it is ;-;
"<|emo_surprise|> Damn dude, can’t believe I never considered this possibility."
<|emo_anger|> > punishment for saying no to rape Surely if you wanted to rape someone you'd have to punish them for saying yes...
<|emo_anger|> How dare you hate [NAME]

<|emo_disgust|> Great vid but horrible grammar. [NAME] i had to read the title 4 times
"<|emo_sad|> You've been a sad boi around here for the last week straight, you'd do well to take a break."
<|emo_sad|> Sorry for your loss 😣
<|emo_sad|> Buying Bitcoin at it's peak is the equivalent of people buy Fyre festival tickets. I'm glad I did neither
<|emo_joy|> Awesome! [NAME] is stilling kicking it through the uprights!
<|emo_sad|> I got a free Razor for being a student so I'm a net loss on their company :D
<|emo_joy|> Saw this a couple days ago and had to stop it and rewind!
<|emo_sad|> Just reading this makes me sick
<|emo_sad|> WHAT. It says due date 12/31/18. Did she have the kid yet? Oh [NAME] I feel so bad for her and that child...... nooooooo
<|emo_anger|> It was stupidmancostume
<|emo_joy|> Happy to hear this! Stay strong and continue fighting! We believe in you <3!
<|emo_anger|> This comparison pic kills me! Stassi looks like a California Raisin!!
<|emo_surprise|> It’s shocking isn’t it? I paid less for a flight from London to Manchester than it would have cost for the train.
<|emo_surprise|> Lol not gonna happen. He is just in love with [NAME]. He fell in love with her when she gave him the hand of the Queen.
<|emo_joy|> I use pinecones :)
<|emo_sad|> I’m thinking it’s from when she was abused when she was pregnant and lost the baby.
<|emo_surprise|> Are you in love with the memories or do you still love him for who he is now?
"<|emo_joy|> It's 2019 and people are *still* saying ""SJW's?"" Ha! Hahahahaha! Oh my life. [NAME]."
<|emo_disgust|> Sex is gross and gross things are immoral to conservatives unless they are doing them.
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME], just admit your were mad."
"<|emo_joy|> I, for one, am glad you didn’t. Happy you’re still with us "
<|emo_disgust|> Vans are ugly as hell. You just cant make a Minivan look mean. Also why are they trying?
<|emo_anger|> WAIT IS THIS FUCKING LOSS!?!
"<|emo_anger|> It looks like those ""true facts"" memes are coming back, too. SHUT IT DOWN, OTTO."
"<|emo_joy|> Now that you're saying it, it actually makes sense. I'll be really hurt, but if she makes him happy I can't stop him."
<|emo_sad|> I am sorry human being :(
<|emo_surprise|> Oh do the thing where you flick food into my mouth!!!
"<|emo_disgust|> My mom likes to use the word, “tripolar” for me and it’s aggravating. "
<|emo_disgust|> I’m a big Spider-Man fan and this looks terrible compared to Spider-verse and the PS4 game.
<|emo_anger|> > Sleeping next to someone I knew my wife is trying to kill me!
<|emo_surprise|> Now I'm wondering on what I've been missing out. Again thank you for this.
<|emo_surprise|> Lol no wonder it's so expensive. I've been wondering if his developers are taking him for a ride.
"<|emo_sad|> Attention, [NAME]! The Empire is attacking the city! I've got a score to settle..."

<|emo_anger|> I know I care about people more than animals... Im a fucking monster.
<|emo_joy|> Hands down one of my favourite VA's and a main reason I go FemShep or play games she's in.
<|emo_anger|> It’s called concern trolling. Don’t be so gullible and quick to politicize everything.
<|emo_sad|> And unfortunately videos like this act as a constant reminder that most people are complete dumbasses. Sad really.
<|emo_sad|> Both parents were drunk. Where were the small children? You helped her cheat and possibly contribute to child neglect. Awesome.
<|emo_surprise|> stone hard heart??????
<|emo_surprise|> My wife would say that all of the above and another dozen more are cheating...and she wonders why I’ve fucked other women...
"<|emo_fear|> Same, ASMR is nightmarish. My skin crawls just thinking about it."
"<|emo_anger|> Yep, hell of a listener"
"<|emo_anger|> I have this too, so don't worry. We are not crazy. Just regular humans who happen to have an anxiety issue. "
<|emo_fear|> I'm scared because we don't really have any isolation scorers right now.

<|emo_disgust|> Cant talk about the a***a
"<|emo_surprise|> Omggg me too ahahaha, i should try shopping in kids"
<|emo_joy|> The characters and story are really enjoyable. The dungeons are awesome. Generally decent sidequests. Fun items. Cool art style and character designs
<|emo_sad|> Had a stroke reading these.
<|emo_surprise|> That comment reads like something out of a circlejerk sub. I can't believe it was said unironically
<|emo_fear|> I know I've heard this phrase before but it's driving me crazy not remembering what it's from Please save me from my torment
"<|emo_anger|> Unfortunately I'm guessing their toxic attitude will alienate them from others, which will only make them more angry and resentful."
<|emo_joy|> Sometimes I think the Padres link these rumors just to remind the world they still exist. ... But it would be fun if they actually came true.
<|emo_sad|> This is going to end badly for him
"<|emo_joy|> Yay, I hope so! I'm feeling good about this decade."
<|emo_joy|> My daughter attempted in November of 2012. She also still struggles. Glad you’re BOTH still alive!
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah, sadly, looks like this champ will be pretty opressive. "
<|emo_anger|> BITCOIN SEND MONEY INSTANTLY (waits 6 months to get money and still praises site)
<|emo_sad|> Its to hard to write for [NAME]?
<|emo_anger|> Then getting irrationally angry when they don’t see it your way.
<|emo_disgust|> That's just reckless. He's lucky he didn't get permanently disfigured or killed.
<|emo_joy|> Feels good to be a Nets fan right now
<|emo_sad|> I set the house on fire and almost killed my entire family
<|emo_anger|> This is amazing OP. Don't care if it's OC or not. This shit had me dying
<|emo_fear|> Seriously Creepy.
<|emo_joy|> Idk I sort of loved seeing rich kids get stranded on an island with nothing but retired 737s to get them home.
"<|emo_anger|> What the hell does metaphysics have to do with this? Also it’s a meme, get over yourself. "
"<|emo_anger|> WTH?! Sorry, but you might need better friends! That is wrong. So wrong. "
<|emo_joy|> oh Ye crazy again for 2019 huh
<|emo_anger|> It was pretty cool seeing him play all the horrible games based off his childhood stardom on AVGN’s YouTube channel. Fucking [NAME].... Bane of my childhood.

"<|emo_joy|> Watched it last night and as someone not generally into supernatural horror/thriller type stuff, I thought it was pretty damn enjoyable. "
<|emo_joy|> This’ll get [NAME] pumped to come over!
"<|emo_sad|> Withdrawal, psychic-shattering, and other activist groups, the principle is very sad."
"<|emo_sad|> We all know you like men who kill lol, so I can see why you'd downplay it."
<|emo_disgust|> You are a disgrace to the species
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah, I was very sad to read that!"
<|emo_anger|> annoyed at most
"<|emo_sad|> Excited? No. Sitting back with popcorn? You bet. Sorry, privilege of not living in the united States."
<|emo_fear|> Yikes that's cringe
"<|emo_disgust|> The only thing worse than this guy, is an actual vegan lecturing random strangers on why meat is murder. "
<|emo_surprise|> I honestly can't tell if he really doesn't care or if he's just soft af... or maybe both lol
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] did a YT vid and now everyone trying to be like him. Sad!
"<|emo_fear|> Honestly thought they were the same thing, thanks for the correction and the expansion of my terrible vocabulary."
<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME]... now you’re stealing my lines.
"<|emo_surprise|> What are you talking about, there was an update this week. And even then 3 weeks is not enough for a huge update"
<|emo_anger|> Goddamn right!
<|emo_anger|> You’re a women hating racist. That’s what you are. Stop talking shite and trying to pretend otherwise
"<|emo_joy|> Gotcha, thanks for the reply. I know about the emulator ones, just wasn’t sure if any had been ported"
<|emo_sad|> I miss seeing us have desperate intense energy. Maybe next game
"<|emo_joy|> okay, enjoy living in ignorance and hatred"
"<|emo_surprise|> Omg actually?! I mean no judgment , I am just SHOOK "
"<|emo_anger|> ""Get the fuck out of the fucking chair"", or something to that avail."
<|emo_surprise|> I genuinely cannot believe [NAME] didn't get fired years ago. It shocks me more than [NAME].
<|emo_anger|> Who’s fucking a shark !?
<|emo_joy|> Omg I love it
<|emo_surprise|> I was explaining how baptism does not affect a person in the same way the Immaculate Conception did.
"<|emo_disgust|> I've got my sticker peeled off, nasty desperate notes left on the windshield, driver door.."
"<|emo_sad|> [NAME]’ column the other day had an interesting line, “zealotry is often people working out their psychological wounds.”"
<|emo_joy|> Wow! Noted!
"<|emo_anger|> I bleed it out, chicken tikka just to throw it away..."
"<|emo_sad|> Yup, I'm sick with a mild cold"
<|emo_anger|> She's a freedom hating commie is what she is. Of course the media loves her; she wants to dismantle everything that made America good.
<|emo_joy|> * hugs you * there you go bro.
<|emo_anger|> Omfg the worst!! want to pull my hair out!!
"<|emo_joy|> Don't be, this is funny. I love it when [NAME] shows his emotions."
"<|emo_sad|> And then there's ""having to listen to parents bragging about how hard they have it"" tired."
<|emo_disgust|> So. Fucking. Tone. Deaf.
"<|emo_fear|> She threatened to hurt you, I would file a police report."
<|emo_sad|> BREAKING NEWS: The new girl had to shred/chip a 6lb entire chub of Kentucky Gold ham today. Poor girl's arm ached the rest of the day.
<|emo_joy|> The smell of pipes and cigars reminds me of my grandpa.
"<|emo_surprise|> I never imagined the world would get so weird that I *wanted* to believe the conspiracy theorists, but here we are."
"<|emo_joy|> I envy flippers, but am in Canada where postage is so high, shipping would eat any profit."
<|emo_joy|> Thanks... that's the laugh I needed today.
<|emo_sad|> I don't get it :( + Idk which game u guys talking about :(
"<|emo_fear|> That or spot up shooting. I like the confidence though, he’s not scared to expand his game."
<|emo_sad|> That is disgusting. No one should act like that to you. I'm so sorry that happened.
"<|emo_joy|> I hope that you find happiness, too. I'm happy that you've had a place to vent. "
<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry for your loss. From the picture it looks like he had a great life if that helps
"<|emo_anger|> Yeah, but nobody takes McD's hamburgers seriously. "
<|emo_sad|> Right there with you. 20 years together and suddenly its over. I'm tired of crying and hurting. We'll get through this.
"<|emo_joy|> Awesome, let's celebrate! Send the free pack over here ;)"
"<|emo_surprise|> I love that in this example the Soviet Union was communist when they were fighting [NAME], but somehow not communist when [NAME] was killing... like everyone."
<|emo_disgust|> That’s sick!
<|emo_joy|> You are a unique woman. Happy for you that you found someone who suits you so well.
<|emo_anger|> Wow she said that? Let me just #red flag
<|emo_joy|> No kidding. Pretty sure my husband enjoys it as much as I do.
<|emo_joy|> This subs favorite game.
"<|emo_sad|> Every time, lots of people overwhelm me. I have light sensitivity to florescents so that doesn't help. "
"<|emo_surprise|> oh that's cool, I didn't know they already got sick time. It'll help a lot with retail workers who get dicked by shit scheduling "
<|emo_anger|> I love working with people but sometimes I really hate people. 🤷🤷🤷
<|emo_sad|> Yep. Been there. Watching my baby crying while vomiting and her eyes looking at me so hurt was hard.
<|emo_sad|> It's more like depression is the default state. We live in a depressing society.
<|emo_anger|> Any more comments calling me SWERF for caring about sex workers will be blocked and reported I s2g
"<|emo_sad|> Oh no, are you going to be psychologically tormented and cry in the shower about it later? "
<|emo_surprise|> it did really
"<|emo_disgust|> Play stupid games, win stupid prizes... looks like she braced before impact. Probably gets this shit all the time. "
<|emo_fear|> I guarantee you it is a huge concern to him. Never let up on the pressure against fascists.
<|emo_anger|> She must hate her father.
<|emo_disgust|> Is the Queen movie bad? That makes me sad. I'm still watch it anyway.
<|emo_joy|> *Most of us are happy to help.
<|emo_joy|> Someone has already written [NAME] is the Aus Open winner on her wikipedia page. Haha
<|emo_sad|> My bad I’ll try to do better
<|emo_anger|> Of course it was a huge hit for him. I hate people
"<|emo_disgust|> Right now, it feels like a good thing but not a great thing. I don't love it... But I don't hate it. "
<|emo_anger|> Fuck why didn’t I think of that
<|emo_anger|> Oh fuck off. Soooo...... when is [NAME] and the gang going to un mask [NAME] as President [NAME]?
<|emo_fear|> That was the only place I saw and their pictures looked horrible. Might just have to go to the source and vacation in southern Asia
"<|emo_fear|> *me Doesn't make any sense if your anxiety is afraid of these things, since it would be scared and go away then. "
<|emo_sad|> Some people have no shame or sense of self-worth. It’s sad.
<|emo_surprise|> She had a reality show that actually showed her in the act doing horrible stuff
<|emo_fear|> If they want to attack [RELIGION] they should be honest with the website title Imagine a [RELIGION] creating a website and calling it WikiChristianity and constantly attack [RELIGION].
"<|emo_anger|> No mercy, if there is any man left inside you than walk out now."
"<|emo_sad|> Help, help, I'm being repressed!"
<|emo_joy|> If anything [NAME] has shown he can do a lot with very little. The Bucs are just a fun team to watch
<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe he came in and 4 seasons in he managed to turn the team into this.
<|emo_surprise|> I don't think you can find a better support line in contenders than alarm and elk. absolutely insane and clutch it's unbelievable
"<|emo_anger|> I swear, this is the most brutal one of this year yet. "
<|emo_joy|> thats amazing!! Congrats!
"<|emo_anger|> This is more like Instant Karma. The schadenfreude is strong with me, here! Wish I could upvote this twice! :)"
<|emo_disgust|> Now you know which cars to wreck into !
"<|emo_joy|> A joke is subjective pal, second of all you need to mature/grow up and get a taste of the real world before giving your political opinions."
<|emo_surprise|> ...what? You're far more concerned with the o line than signing [NAME].
<|emo_joy|> Someone get fat boy [NAME] a happy meal.
"<|emo_sad|> In addition to poor judgement, she is incapable of admitting she is wrong and apologizing. "
"<|emo_sad|> ""But Aunt [NAME], I don't *want* to send Grandma back to Italy!"""
"<|emo_sad|> Yes, at home recuperating from a fractured ankle. "
<|emo_surprise|> I'm baffled
<|emo_disgust|> He’s bad
"<|emo_disgust|> what do you wanna bet [NAME] thought they meant ""his"" campus sexual assault info as opposed to everyones and just stalled to be safe?"
<|emo_joy|> Thats fine as long as the creative director is still there.... Though the talent will be missed
<|emo_surprise|> Yeah usually there are the c-1 but this go around this is what was handed. I like them
"<|emo_anger|> For serial rapists, its not about the physical pleasure. Its all head games. Damn freaks"
"<|emo_anger|> Feudalism is statism, dumbass."
<|emo_fear|> why fire make hand hurt
<|emo_surprise|> You haven’t missed anything. I looked out of curiosity and didn’t look twice. I was surprised that Colt would do that.
"<|emo_disgust|> FUCK OFF THAT""S A PEN"
"<|emo_sad|> Damn, and now this GIF has become bittersweet. I really wanted him to become a revolutionary icon."
<|emo_disgust|> This is his worst season since his rookie year
"<|emo_fear|> I tend to invalidate my feelings because I’m always worried that they’re going to think that being silly, I’m always struggling with it"
"<|emo_sad|> Feel so bad for her, not even mad about the glove wipe-offs. "
<|emo_anger|> It's a prime-time soap. I feel so guilty.
<|emo_anger|> Block him and stop replying to his comments. Not worth it.
<|emo_fear|> That was brutal as hell. Loved it
<|emo_anger|> This is repulsive what the fuck is wrong with places like this. It does have an element of hilarity tho
<|emo_disgust|> Today is the only day I really hate my job as a dog walker
"<|emo_anger|> That's ironic. Because [NAME] isn't getting the Wall funded, we are pulling more resources off the border blockade effort?"
<|emo_anger|> What the hell did you just type?
"<|emo_sad|> They're all the same, all the ratemes are a trap. It's just sad people keep falling for them because its so obvious it genuinely hurts."
<|emo_disgust|> Well that sucks. The disconnect reconnect and keeping your bloodpoints I mean. The accidental vs purposeful disconnect seems fair.
<|emo_sad|> Yikes. I feel sorry for the team that gives him anything above 5.5
<|emo_sad|> my mistake :(
"<|emo_sad|> I’ll miss you, [NAME] Today is a sad day for our high sock loving brethren [NAME]"
"<|emo_joy|> Well being very close to the border, I know lots of [NAME] and your guys' hugs are always warm!"
<|emo_sad|> Struggling to find :(
<|emo_sad|> My grandmother-in-law does this. I’m sorry to anyone in the Va Beach area.
<|emo_anger|> How many attempts did that insane tech take to pull off?
<|emo_disgust|> I mean purely in the context of these pants he isn’t wrong
"<|emo_sad|> Clearly, he had a bad Wednesday practice…"
<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry for your loss
<|emo_joy|> That'll be a testical festival for sure. Have fun.
<|emo_anger|> Holy hell I hate them so much.
<|emo_fear|> I’m kind of scared to talk to my manager about it
<|emo_disgust|> It’s awful. I couldn’t even see the ending at all.
<|emo_surprise|> Omg lol at least now you Will be more careful before throwing out words like that. I would die.
<|emo_sad|> It would be funny and sad if he gets heart complications again
"<|emo_joy|> That’s kind of what makes the “guest” response funny, how did it get there?"
<|emo_anger|> I'd rather die than drive a Volvo!
"<|emo_anger|> Ahh damn! Gotta pay attention to that, never even knew!"
"<|emo_anger|> Dig up, stupid! "
"<|emo_anger|> No my friend, no, I no make fuck-fuck. I take you to girls, many many girls. You make fuck-fuck with girls."
<|emo_anger|> WAIT IS THIS FUCKING LOSS!?!
<|emo_sad|> I remember that one. It was so painful to watch
<|emo_surprise|> Wow...is that true? I’d love to see more on that. Can you provide any links or documents on that?
"<|emo_disgust|> Always remember that when problems get hardcore, Pornshit will be there to Worst them."
"<|emo_joy|> Kinda like getting your RN. And, kissing your knees, back, etc goodbye."
<|emo_surprise|> OH MY GOD! The PTA has disbanded! Ahh! Ahh! AHHHHH •jumps through window•
"<|emo_disgust|> If we change the definition of what we are, maybe women will want to fuck us! -incel logic"
<|emo_disgust|> I told you I'm not in the mood for a snog tonight!
<|emo_anger|> What the Fuck?
"<|emo_disgust|> Good lord, totally missed that. What a croc."
<|emo_fear|> This is scary.
<|emo_fear|> It's a weird way of saying you don't want to see my penis
<|emo_joy|> Work on your anxiety and self-esteem. Do things for YOU. Love yourself.
<|emo_joy|> Love this answer.
<|emo_sad|> who was it I missed it
<|emo_surprise|> Wanna trade lives? I'd gladly take normal height with hair and have the same experience.
<|emo_surprise|> My [NAME]... This makes it so much more cringe.
<|emo_disgust|> The fact that this statement got downvoted shows how worthless some people on here are.
<|emo_disgust|> > What plans should I use to hide the scent of a decaying body? Can you bottle up his farts? Seriously.
<|emo_anger|> It's more like the western world is infuriated that a non-democratic Asian republic is on the trajectory to becoming the leading superpower. Case in point ^
<|emo_surprise|> OMG!!
"<|emo_fear|> Some people just need reassurance that they are, in fact, dumb. "
<|emo_anger|> She is an asshat for driving on the walkway but fuck these guys. They should probably find something better to do with their lives.
<|emo_anger|> No it's not. I'd bet his biggest crime was being an introvert. Low-inhibition psychos never seem to lack for female companionship.
"<|emo_anger|> This is such a lame idea. Instead of getting better and outplaying your opponent, you just want to make your opponent worse. Sad."
"<|emo_surprise|> Ah, interesting. I couldn't find a translation like that. My French is very basic though so it might be right!"
<|emo_fear|> That sounds terrible.
<|emo_disgust|> I'm so tired I read anti neurons as anti lemons for some reason
<|emo_anger|> Wtf is a weeb
<|emo_anger|> All the people who got on at canning bridge station this morning and kept pushing and shoving each other like animals.
<|emo_surprise|> He’s 30 freaking years old and is scared of managing a bank account. *eyeroll*
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I read that years ago, but I didn't realize it was about Narcs."
<|emo_fear|> You're creepy
<|emo_sad|> I’ve always heard that the two people you *never* hook up with are exes and roommates. That’s the only bad sounding part of this.
<|emo_disgust|> Thats absolutely disgusting.
"<|emo_joy|> >cold, dead butt Ah, so it's laughter. Laughter is what kills me. "
"<|emo_joy|> Haha I don't know where you are, but I feel you"
<|emo_sad|> You are a sad person
<|emo_disgust|> He was horrible
<|emo_sad|> I try my damndest. Hard to be sad these days when I got this guy with me
"<|emo_fear|> Auch, that's gotta hurt..."
"<|emo_disgust|> Do you have any non anecdotal stuff to say or? Also burden of proof is a thing, you made a claim, prove it or fuck off"
<|emo_sad|> That has gotten me killed a few times lately.
"<|emo_anger|> He forgot the most important law : Everyone can be stupid, and everyone will be at some point. Although he does illustrate it very well with his article."
<|emo_surprise|> shockingly close to reality.
"<|emo_anger|> It has to be, or there will be nothing left to save."
<|emo_joy|> I have found that sometimes you can redirect their tantrums by asking them where their nose is.
<|emo_anger|> How dare you disrespect my boy [NAME]
<|emo_surprise|> Glad to see Tael (wabi) on the list but surprised its not at the top.
<|emo_anger|> I hate it too. But I will....
<|emo_surprise|> Are we not going to discuss the fact that his head is forming from the top of his ear
"<|emo_sad|> There has been the odd occasion without condoms. No deep penetration, but never the less. Some. I feel awful."
<|emo_surprise|> What have I watched ?! My eyes!!! Mom!!!
<|emo_sad|> This really hurts my feelings.
<|emo_joy|> Phoenix sunrises and sunsets have been nice the past week with all the clouds and rain - beautiful shot!
<|emo_joy|> I bought milk and honey for its cover. ended up loving it anyway.
<|emo_disgust|> This sounds an awful lot like khorne......
<|emo_sad|> Not really cringe. Just sad.
<|emo_fear|> What’s the clip from? I’m scared to put “teen boy good kisser 900 number” into YouTube
"<|emo_anger|> I review you - *clap clap* - [NAME], bye bitch, gone"
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME]. someone finally posted something I can't bring myself to finish reading, it's too much"
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] fuck those creeps
"<|emo_surprise|> Fox News devoted 42 seconds on [NAME], wow."
<|emo_anger|> Poor poor poor bastard
"<|emo_joy|> Been to 54 countries at age 34. No debts, ever. Aiming for retirement in my early 40's. Life is good."
"<|emo_sad|> He probably does, but people don’t speak Godlish very well."
<|emo_surprise|> I took in a friend of mine and creating a vanity for her (she loves to do her makeup) is honestly one of my more cherished memories.
<|emo_joy|> It's a great time to be Scottish anaw
<|emo_anger|> Good that corporate knows about it. They'll launch a LP investigation and fuck the idiots doing this.
<|emo_sad|> Sorry for having a working brain :3
<|emo_sad|> I wish I could be desensitized to my sadness sometimes lol
<|emo_surprise|> A beautiful poem for a beautiful thing. Happy cake day btw!
<|emo_disgust|> This is a bad post and you should feel bad for being the author
<|emo_sad|> My organs love me. I wonder how emotionally damaged a person has to be to come up with these. It's weird and sad.
<|emo_disgust|> Never forget when [NAME] almost knocked [NAME] out
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if truly might be work stress. He works long hours at a prestigious law firm. I need to five him more credit.
<|emo_disgust|> I can’t look at [NAME] with this hair!
<|emo_joy|> I for one am happy for [NAME] ballin out. Now let's go win this game !!!!
"<|emo_anger|> At least he was polite - ""please"" fuck off! "
<|emo_fear|> Who is brainwashing people to believe it's all a social construct ? It's really frightening that it's become so mainstream.
"<|emo_anger|> >Downvote me, you cowards."
"<|emo_disgust|> Ah, so you've an ugly face as well. Can it be rectified via plastic surgery?"
<|emo_anger|> the worse part is you might be crazy yourself and have no idea!
"<|emo_sad|> I'm in a similar boat, had surgery to correct Pectus Excavatum when in 2011, also 18 now, also deal with constant chronic pain."
<|emo_surprise|> I think Judge came in a little too late so he’ll need to be amazing for the next 8 years
"<|emo_disgust|> The baby photos, holy fucking shit there's so many baby photos now."
"<|emo_fear|> Nah, rest is pretty cringe too"
<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe he used the N-word.
<|emo_disgust|> It’s more like a bunch of vaguely veiled racists and sexists and MAGAtards. Unless that’s what you consider “good.”
<|emo_joy|> Hahahahhahhaha!!! Thats the right wing in a nutshell.....
"<|emo_sad|> That's fair. Seems pretty lefty heavy, though."
<|emo_disgust|> that was a horrible mess with 3k skills
<|emo_anger|> We need to end the nonsense of objectivity in teaching. Students need to hear how educated adults think.
"<|emo_joy|> My dog knows when I say ""BRB"" on the mic he gets up and runs to the door."
"<|emo_joy|> Joseph Vincent is the goat when it comes to highlights, I’m so happy he made a Saquads video"
<|emo_joy|> > when Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha
"<|emo_anger|> I wish, the brainwashed idiots here in California love her. It makes me sick. California is a lost cause."
"<|emo_joy|> You too! (FYI I accidentally initially replied in a new comment, in case you didn’t see my other reply)"
<|emo_surprise|> This makes me wonder if they fixed [NAME] having a very noticeable gap between her body and legs with her new shorts.
"<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck? Really? That’s horrible. That’s probably illegal. If it isn’t, it should be."
<|emo_fear|> No bullet dodged this was a traumatic event that will follow this poor thing around the rest of her life.
<|emo_fear|> This is terrifying
"<|emo_fear|> Oh, the ""Thomas the nuclear bomb""? That scarred me."
<|emo_anger|> Never said that. Not once. Punishment isn’t slavery. Unless you’d rather just kill lawbreakers
<|emo_sad|> Sorry was talking about OP being in Alabama.
<|emo_sad|> My whole life’s been a lie
"<|emo_disgust|> That’s about what ours is, but our rush hour traffic is horrible."
"<|emo_joy|> I really enjoyed Fractured But Whole, but I don't remember the meals being significant (it's been like a year). Can you explain?"
<|emo_surprise|> TIL that [NAME] is a guy.
<|emo_surprise|> It a scammer not an undercover
<|emo_sad|> It'll be hard to surive on that wage in Vancouver. It's expensive AF here.
"<|emo_fear|> [NAME], that is so horrible. I’m so sorry for you and OP."
<|emo_joy|> Finally the UN gets off their ass and does something. So glad she’s finally safe (for now).
<|emo_anger|> >CFMEU Any excuse to act like thugs and not do any work.
"<|emo_surprise|> Did not expect to be over here shouting in agreement with [NAME], yet here we are!"
<|emo_disgust|> I'm [RELIGION] and I'm disgusting lol
"<|emo_anger|> You really don't comprehend anything my man, now do you? Goodness gracious the amount of stupidity. "
"<|emo_fear|> I fear slowly losing myself, and my cognition over an illness far more than I fear dying from a random accident tbh. "
<|emo_anger|> oh shitttt. it’s upside down
"<|emo_sad|> Great read, still know a few folks who are still unhappy about the situation and won’t support [NAME]"
<|emo_sad|> This is so sweet and it makes me so happy. But also so sad because I hate seeing families torn apart.
<|emo_sad|> Shows you that one must never underestimate the rust caused by ACL injuries
<|emo_disgust|> The worst is starting out in a new relationship after leaving a failing one. You want to fall but you know how much the breakups hurt
<|emo_anger|> ... or if they’re having a bad time because life is a bit crap.
"<|emo_anger|> I read that as ""It's fat being fucked in the picture"" lmfaoooo"
<|emo_sad|> Scars do not fade after 2 weeks. Its gonna take a few months. I've got some nasty scars too girl I feel your pain
<|emo_anger|> Not if ya delusional boi here buys it first
<|emo_joy|> I was JUST thinking about how much I enjoyed Swalla la laaaa last night too!
<|emo_sad|> poor [NAME] is in jail now for assassination.
<|emo_anger|> The fuck?! You're in the wrong subreddit with this regressive bullshit victim blaming.
<|emo_disgust|> Wow those latkes look even worse than I thought they would.
<|emo_joy|> Good luck to you! Cheers to a new year! 👍🏼
"<|emo_sad|> I would never wish for someone to get injured, but an injury needs to happen at the Pro Bowl so they cancel it forever."
<|emo_joy|> Pretty cool.
<|emo_surprise|> The amount of overreaction on this thread is too damn high!
<|emo_joy|> No worries. Have a nice day.
<|emo_anger|> Shame the 'all in' doesn't apply to managers. He has hired some duff managers over the years.
"<|emo_anger|> Accounting. I love the work, hate the people and the environment."
<|emo_disgust|> Honestly I’ve seen kids that age do really gross stuff
"<|emo_anger|> Too many people using it to justify bigotry. Mostly homophobia, transphobia, sexism, etc etc."
<|emo_joy|> I'm 35 was married for 10 years and now I'm not and I am so happy to be alone
<|emo_joy|> I really like this ring so I’m glad to hear that.
<|emo_anger|> He’s a professional liar making promises to get elected when all he concerned with is a power gain.
"<|emo_anger|> Tortilla chips are the worst oml. One time a piece got lodged between my gum and my tooth. Like, that fella was /deeply/ embedded in my gum"
<|emo_fear|> It just never got weird enough..
"<|emo_joy|> This is a real funny joke, [NAME]."
<|emo_joy|> Everytime I get to hug someone.
<|emo_anger|> Sucks to suck
"<|emo_joy|> I feel you, mama. I hope tomorrow is a better day."
<|emo_joy|> I would think I was in a horror movie and lock the doors. Lol
<|emo_sad|> Be adult Pay taxes to govt Be deemed incompetent by people with different views Feels bad
<|emo_anger|> They’re not just investments. They’re deliberately exploitative and China’s not operating in good faith
<|emo_anger|> So why did [NAME] leave? They were predictable and mostly tolerable. Three wings is absolutely intolerable. I hate him.
<|emo_anger|> Yeah but being president is the only thing keeping him from being indicted so he’s kinda stuck.
<|emo_joy|> I had a blast watching it and am glad you did too!
<|emo_sad|> look more 4th grade comments. sorry you're a child who has no brain. I bet your mother wishes she had a child who lived.
"<|emo_fear|> Tranlated: Wooooo be afraid of the spooky ""shadowban"" so don't do the thing that gets your message to a wider audience. Smh"
<|emo_disgust|> I would of taken a shit in the woods real quick
<|emo_fear|> Or you just get rejected and then not murdered and your anxiety worsens until you can no longer approach women or even men.
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME], you’re 12. Go do your homework instead of trying to be edgy on the Internet. "
<|emo_joy|> now I kinda wish [NAME] wasn't an imaginary cartoon character because this would actually be fun.
<|emo_joy|> Swordfish is my go to gun. Used my first unlock token it given how much I enjoyed it.
<|emo_surprise|> This was literally me!
<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] this is going to garner such hate hahaha
<|emo_surprise|> SOOOOO TRUE!!
<|emo_surprise|> The savior!
"<|emo_sad|> He burnt out. Give it some time. Other option is he never really cared, but I find that unlikely. Also maybe life just happened."
"<|emo_surprise|> How did [NAME] just give that beatdown to Attach, the other player was so far away."
<|emo_anger|> People deleting and stop caring IS THE REASON why artifact is under 2k players.
<|emo_joy|> Awesome; two steps back then one forward; so many big devs these days.
<|emo_anger|> Im retarded lmao Etiz/flualp
<|emo_joy|> Happy MLK day

<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit that’s nothing
"<|emo_joy|> Love this. I thought I replied this morning, but I’m definitely taking your ideas and going to try them! Best of luck"
<|emo_anger|> Oh man is this true. Coffee has a seriously negative effect on some people! I'm 39 and just figured it out this year
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah the question makes no sense without more context.
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME]? Nah, that's him in the background. The idiot with the leaves is [NAME]. It's always fucking [NAME]."
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, did you not know [NAME] is the highest graded overall passrusher in this class? At any position!"
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, now that you say that . Although, we do have [NAME], South Park, Family Guy and American Dad now. Mmmmm, [NAME] "
<|emo_joy|> That’d be lovely. Although now I have to root for AD to the Lakers which makes my chest hurt

<|emo_joy|> And I will laugh at everyone wasting their first round pick on him.
<|emo_disgust|> There are worse things!!!:
<|emo_disgust|> one of them shotting 22lr if I recall? Heck most the worst used a pistol ether exclusively or with a shotty too
<|emo_anger|> what a ground licker. Day 9799 of being alive - I still hate people.

"<|emo_disgust|> Pb, filth!"
<|emo_sad|> I'm lost here
<|emo_sad|> That last sentence pains me

<|emo_disgust|> People are very complicated.
<|emo_anger|> What a cuck! But the sword and steal the groceries!

<|emo_anger|> Chaaaandler BING! OHHH MYYY GAWDDD!
<|emo_disgust|> That doesn't sound right but I don't know enough about stars to dispute it
"<|emo_surprise|> This seems like a good as time as any to ask, what's some hype super robot stuff to check out? I've only ever seen Gurren."

"<|emo_anger|> Everyone hates guys that talk shit and can't back it up, don't start shit when you suck."

<|emo_sad|> Imagine the baby being retarded
<|emo_anger|> Yeah that was inexcusable
<|emo_joy|> This is a really lovely ends to a crappy means. I’m glad you enjoyed yourself and got something out of it.

<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is a hungry little bastard.
<|emo_fear|> Horrific. Shameful.
<|emo_surprise|> Talk to your grandparents... you will be surprised on how much general knowledge they have to share.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME]. [NAME] and [NAME] just style on these scrubs with fucking mecha Tai Chi.
"<|emo_anger|> They wont touch a hero if they tweaked it in last 6-12 months. Like [NAME], they fucked/nerfed her and thats it."
"<|emo_sad|> That's awful. I'm sorry that you had that experience, but yeah, mission accomplished, sorta."
<|emo_disgust|> The more you wind me up the worse it gets for her later on
<|emo_surprise|> I moved from Chicago to Indianapolis a couple years ago. Nobody shovels their sidewalks here. Nobody. It's pure horror.
<|emo_joy|> It makes me feel good. Wholesome is a very subjective thing.
<|emo_joy|> Last time I saw was loooong ago. Basically before LN announced they went for probabilistic routing.
"<|emo_surprise|> I've heard how hard it is to get into nursing programs, congratulations!"
<|emo_disgust|> Damn. I want to see some of those comments!
"<|emo_anger|> Poverty has taught me to be practically happy with being hungry, especially considering when you finally do eat you'll be in fucking heaven"
<|emo_joy|> It was my wedding song!

"<|emo_sad|> What are you even talking about? I'm sorry you don't like [NAME], get over it."
<|emo_sad|> My score per minute is terrible because I only snipe so asking the wrong person. Sorry dude
"<|emo_surprise|> It sounds like you’re enzyme deficient, I’ve never heard of someone becoming sensitive to a drug from using it "
<|emo_disgust|> Well that's disgusting
<|emo_anger|> What the hell is going on at Getty Images?
<|emo_joy|> Hi [NAME]. Glad you are joining us and am looking forward to watching your episode. Did you do sleeve or rny? I am having rny in 2 weeks!

<|emo_sad|> Purposefully hurt people. [NAME]. I don’t understand why anyone cares.
"<|emo_disgust|> Even better, won't feel as bad eating the whole thing in one sitting then."
<|emo_disgust|> Scared? A little bit. It's more of a simmering disgust at this point for myself.
<|emo_sad|> ... and no one seemed to care Except that lonely woman with white hair
<|emo_joy|> You are correct. But sometimes you might have a plan or you have to improvise. I’m glad it worked.
<|emo_sad|> It’s not you. These subs are terrible. Even beautiful women get insulted on there ugh
<|emo_surprise|> No joke. Physics or chemistry I can see but comp 101? I’m surprised he has the ability to find the internet
<|emo_sad|> Females living on Recruit difficulty. Smh
<|emo_anger|> you can't really see the shitty comments on youtube. On instagram it's much easier
<|emo_anger|> you beat me to it. Take your fucking upvote
"<|emo_fear|> Given my grandpaernts survived the holocaust and told us everything, we have a horrible yet interesting family humour. "
"<|emo_anger|> And if they can't find US suckers to give them cheap labor with desired skills, they'll simply replace you with an imported indentured laborer from India."
"<|emo_sad|> Bravo! It's hard saying you need help, and sometimes even harder accepting it. So proud of you momma!"
"<|emo_sad|> Oh sorry- to be clearer, I meant everyone not on the APP looking for a scooter will get sick of seeing random scooters. "
<|emo_sad|> I don’t get it :(
<|emo_joy|> I’m happy for you two. Cheers!
<|emo_disgust|> Kratz and insertion in the same sentence makes me nauseous for some reason..
<|emo_sad|> Those ads actually make me feel bad for financial advisors gouging clients with excessive fees.
<|emo_joy|> Just think of the awesome stories though!
<|emo_joy|> Very sweet of [NAME]
<|emo_disgust|> He’s creepy
<|emo_surprise|> Look at that subtle colouring. The tasteful thickness. Oh my [NAME]. It even has a watermark.

"<|emo_disgust|> Bro, highmountain looking sick"

<|emo_joy|> We don’t improve without discovering our problems. Good on you man- wish you and your boyfriend many happinesses 🙂
<|emo_surprise|> Wow 😮 you really convinced me... like gtfo here
"<|emo_surprise|> Suddenly, I was awake."
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad you're feeling better! Keep smiling :)

"<|emo_disgust|> People will stop wanting to punch/jail these people when they stop being ignorant, selfish pricks putting newborn babies at risk."
"<|emo_disgust|> Ah, so you've an ugly face as well. Can it be rectified via plastic surgery?"
<|emo_disgust|> It *feels* unethical?
"<|emo_joy|> I enjoy the harsh throat hit, reminds me of cigs. Edit: Mango is still my favorite though."
<|emo_joy|> Nice-full circle! Leaving [NAME] for dust- I love it.
<|emo_fear|> Looks deliriously boring.
<|emo_surprise|> time flies so fast when you're 18. i didnt expect id turn 30 and still a virgin. hah
<|emo_fear|> Idk I’d kind of like [NAME] to come up next year. [NAME] still scares me a little. Not saying I don’t like the guy
"<|emo_anger|> sorry this happened to you. id be sad and angry too if i worked hard on something, and someone took that away"
"<|emo_joy|> Me too! So pumped! Enjoy the game, bud!"
<|emo_joy|> It was funny until they started to diss on chick fil a

"<|emo_surprise|> Frankly, I'm continuously shocked that more than 35% of the population actually think he's doing a good job. "
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] you are a freak.
<|emo_fear|> That is not the reason we do not want to leave the CU. Try again.
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a creeper and hangs out with underage girls n shit.
"<|emo_sad|> Life is nothing but a hell filled with torment, misery and loss."
<|emo_anger|> Damn the Cubs fell hard!
<|emo_joy|> Enjoy :) You won't regret it. The first couple seasons will be a little confusing but wiki helped me understand this show a lot!
<|emo_sad|> Imagine being born in 1987 and not having been invited to a party since your friend's birthday party in 1999 though :(
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] just commented on my comment with links to the pamphlet! ‘Tis real!
<|emo_joy|> Happy Birthday!! It was great seeing her at the Royal Rumble and SmackDown.
"<|emo_anger|> The biggest argument on your side is depreciate costs. You could challenge their concern of ""getting fooled"" by getting the car inspected by an independent."
"<|emo_fear|> For sure. I am infatuated with sharks, and much of that obsession comes from absolute fear haha. "
<|emo_sad|> I called an ambulance for my friend without knowing it was against her wishes. She never blamed me but I felt really bad about it.
<|emo_surprise|> Most likely shock that had him so comatose.
<|emo_sad|> Actually [NAME] had the #1 PP who bazooka [NAME] fired lol
<|emo_fear|> Women are dangerous as hell too.
"<|emo_disgust|> I think everyone should watch the first season. It's hilarious, but also a pretty brutal indictment about what a show politics is."
<|emo_disgust|> Never happened to me. Seems it would feel weird.
<|emo_surprise|> Damn. Didn't know [NAME] was still making videos.
<|emo_sad|> Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result
<|emo_disgust|> Shut up why do you even care about what people choose to do with their bodies lol move on and keep living your miserable and ignorant existence.
<|emo_fear|> I can't imagine how scary that was for you. What is wrong with people?
"<|emo_surprise|> Yes. Wait until recreational marijuana is legalised federally. Portugal could legalize all drugs including cocaine, but they are a small country."
"<|emo_surprise|> Wait, what? You're a gamer who's never even heard of TB?"
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] has gotta he replaced or that was just terrible writing
"<|emo_surprise|> That’s awesome, what do you do if you don’t mind me asking?"
"<|emo_anger|> Some college professors and their teaching staff may need to die. Oh, wait... saying that is hate speech."
<|emo_joy|> Awesome! Glad you found it informative! Thanks for watching.
"<|emo_sad|> as a woman, I can tell ya it’s not uncommon for that to happen, haha. [NAME] make it extra sad though."
<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised [NAME] let her post that.
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME], we have a guy with a bucket on his head and you have pornstars. I’m glad I live on this side of the Atlantic "
"<|emo_surprise|> Omg what the ever loving bloody hell did I just read?? As an artist, this was extra painful to me."
<|emo_anger|> Now I really want to see them. Stupid brain!
"<|emo_sad|> one dude puked on my patio, he fell out at 2am! weak!"
<|emo_surprise|> Not any meaningful amount as far as I can tell. Although I’d love to be surprised
<|emo_sad|> I guess I'm just too nice to people and I gotta learn to start sayin no.
"<|emo_sad|> I feel bad for her, talk to her :("
<|emo_disgust|> Being ugly and confident does not mean you'll do well in dating. You'll just try more.

"<|emo_anger|> Don't bother, redditors hate Israel "
"<|emo_sad|> How about this, you can be the ""bigger man"" and the rest of us will bask in the tears of saints fans. "
"<|emo_joy|> That's just the adrenaline. It'll set in soon, haha"
<|emo_anger|> Exactly. It's rediculous
<|emo_joy|> Oh cool. Did everything else that got listed not happen either?
<|emo_sad|> I was also bullied at work. I was on lithium for a while. You're not alone.
"<|emo_disgust|> If being bisexual means I'm in a cult, I'm kind of pissed because I haven't received my cult robes yet."
"<|emo_sad|> Ah, i misunderstood what he was going for, sorry my bad"
"<|emo_disgust|> Exactly and the ""they removed it because of historical accuracy"" is bullshit because crossbows were invented way before then."
<|emo_anger|> only suckers believe this don't be a sucker
<|emo_anger|> I thought chiropractors were bad! Look as these medical doctors who were pushing opiates on their patients by the thousands!
"<|emo_disgust|> Crack whores are hooking in broad daylight now, eh?"
<|emo_anger|> The phone calls in the first 10 minutes are absolutely damning.
"<|emo_disgust|> If your weed is decent you don't need tobacco to help it burn, and tobacco is addictive"
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] fucking dammit
"<|emo_disgust|> Disgusting, but fascinating."
<|emo_disgust|> She NeVer SaId No. ThAT's hOw CoNsEnT wOrKs rIgHt? She OWES me sex. She has boobs and we're fRiEnDs!
"<|emo_sad|> That’s what the auto-shut off is, that thing that I said malfunctioned due to the extreme cold."
<|emo_surprise|> 0 <----- This is how many people were surprised
<|emo_joy|> I’m glad not too much time was put into this
<|emo_anger|> I'm just now realizing that I married a covert narc.
<|emo_disgust|> No! That's horrible news!..for Galaxy fans lol
<|emo_fear|> I'm phobic of needles and babies so that was NOT a picture I wanted to see.
"<|emo_anger|> Fuck the people that couldn't make rent, pay bills or medical costs because of the shutdown, right?"
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] looking like his fucking controller disconnected
<|emo_sad|> That's unfortunate for you.
<|emo_disgust|> That mustache looks like it smells.
<|emo_joy|> Love reading these kind of posts! So happy for you.
<|emo_anger|> Oh this poor sap
"<|emo_anger|> Real paying customers never need to remind you of that fact. Tresspass her out of your shop, she wasn't going to buy anything anyway."
<|emo_fear|> I’m kind of scared to talk to my manager about it
"<|emo_fear|> Well I'm scared as shit let's hope for the best, benz should be back(?)"
<|emo_surprise|> oooops... now you tell me???
<|emo_disgust|> It's even worse when one considers that they are intent on moving to Europe and that by moving to a developed region their carbon footprint will increase significantly.
<|emo_joy|> Happy just came out
<|emo_sad|> This mode is dead. Sorry :/
<|emo_sad|> Please tell me that [NAME] never said this.
<|emo_fear|> this video made me feel like screaming
<|emo_joy|> Volunteer. Helping people in need will make you feel better about both yourself and others.
<|emo_fear|> As anyone else ever **needed** waffles before? This winter morning is killing me.
<|emo_disgust|> This is so cruel. I literally feel physically sick.
<|emo_surprise|> Is that seriously the story? I haven’t googled it. I just thought it was cool as a WW2 buff
"<|emo_sad|> True, but I meant he has no holiday themed skin from any of those events and all his skins (volsksya included) are pretty bland sadly..."
<|emo_fear|> That live snail got me freaked
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] tipped 1000 Donuts for this comment!
<|emo_disgust|> Being a [NAME] is no different from being a [NAME]. Both have caused genocides. I hate how our society only focuses on one though!
<|emo_sad|> My comment provided shame. I am nothing.
<|emo_sad|> sick burn
<|emo_disgust|> Thought it looked weird as well.
<|emo_fear|> There’s this which is terrifying to think about
<|emo_disgust|> you just use the word weird like that's all there is to it. weird isn't the issue. the issue is garbage
<|emo_anger|> Damn you! Now all this dirty money is flooding Frankfurt and Dublin!
<|emo_surprise|> I know I don't know the Spanish alphabet but I can't believe I didn't catch that before
<|emo_surprise|> Nice try hom... oh no it’s real this time D:
<|emo_sad|> That’s very unfortunate for the bosses. Capitalism sure does commit genocide. Ireland. India. Indonesia. Vietnam. Iraq. Should I name more?
"<|emo_sad|> It's brainwashing. When you have people keep pleasuring themselves, they're easier to manipulate. "
"<|emo_disgust|> When I need to skin an alligator they cease to exist but when I'm escaping I hear the alligators yell ""WELCOME TO THRASHTOWN, POPULATION YOU"""
<|emo_joy|> the ancap ideology has spread to birds now. Our numbers grow stronger every day😂

<|emo_joy|> So glad to hear that! you go girl<3
<|emo_joy|> Spending the day with family in beautiful Bowral 🌿
"<|emo_surprise|> That's true, but I was surprised to find absolutely ZERO information about a person who , presumably, has quite a bit of power and influence."

<|emo_joy|> [NAME] line of drool made me very happy I waited to watch this til I was eating dinner i love the power hour so much
<|emo_joy|> That's pretty gross. Unlucky OP.
<|emo_joy|> r/redditminusmods its the first post there.
<|emo_sad|> Very sad news for the man. Widespread travel disruption is expected for the evening commute
<|emo_sad|> wanna high key low key high key slide into [NAME] DMs even though I'm literally distraught at him and [NAME] separating
"<|emo_sad|> While it is unfortunate to hear that he is no longer interested, I hope that this brought some level of closure to you."
<|emo_sad|> I always move back and always regret it.
<|emo_anger|> It's not illegal to be ungrateful. You can't force someone to take care of someone like you're wanting.
<|emo_sad|> You know I’m sad the [NAME] hype is over because I actually think he’s been really good for us overall. I still trust him.
<|emo_sad|> Right... so true. I’m sorry you’re going through this too.

<|emo_anger|> THIS FOOKIN GAME
<|emo_joy|> Which is why I'm glad he turn around as he did. xD Still is both scary and funny if you look at it from a different light
"<|emo_joy|> That sound you are hearing is me, a middle aged woman, applauding you wildly. How fun this is to read on my morning break."
<|emo_fear|> This is scary and so very sad. Eleven??? A baby! I was still building forts. I weep for this child.
<|emo_sad|> Is it because of the huge black spider above it?!? That bugs me more than it being off center...
<|emo_joy|> Let's go [NAME]
"<|emo_disgust|> What a disgusting pair of human beings, if you can even call them that"
<|emo_joy|> Fly out of KDVT? Love flying out there.
<|emo_disgust|> I would be creeped out.
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] THAT HURTS DON'T DO THAT
"<|emo_joy|> I too have had this happen on XBONE. I really want to love this game, but it keeps giving me reasons to play something else."
<|emo_anger|> What a greedy person. 8 years jail and hopefully disgraced out of his profession.
"<|emo_joy|> Funny enough, I'm a Braves fan from CT whose main football team is the saints... So I don't like this post one bit. "

<|emo_sad|> It's hard to care about a woman dying from giving birth when you hate women in the first place.
<|emo_joy|> Omw. When my man sends me that I get all warm and excited cuz I know I get to spends the next couple hours or days with him
"<|emo_joy|> Thank you. I think I may know that already, but I might need to hear it from others at times when I miss him a lot. "
"<|emo_anger|> Fuck it, maybe the faceless men worship the great other AND assassinated the fire warlocks in valyria, hwo knows?"
<|emo_joy|> Someone get fat boy [NAME] a happy meal.
"<|emo_surprise|> Yes, because private matches are a thing. Surprised no one else has mentioned that one."
"<|emo_sad|> As someone who has been in a similar relationship, it is indeed emotional abuse."
"<|emo_sad|> That’s too bad, I didn’t know that."
<|emo_joy|> Glad he survived or it might have become a *dead*lift.
<|emo_anger|> Mine is 2.5 and trying to drop her last nap. She needs it so desperately though. It is HELLLLLL dealing with this.
<|emo_surprise|> I’ve never heard of this before. That’s awful.
<|emo_sad|> I HAVE EYE PROBLEMS NOW IM REALLY YELLING
"<|emo_disgust|> Democrat politician, my bad should have specified. We are mostly all “liberals” here even if we’ve been alienated on this issue."
"<|emo_sad|> There are no words to help heal your broken heart, but I’m sending you as much love and support I can. "
"<|emo_anger|> Say thos: mom, dad, she's busted. Respect my wishes!"
<|emo_joy|> And yet the next time [NAME] stirs the pot with some stunt like this it'll get major traction AGAIN.
<|emo_disgust|> Wtf you missed the Tigers 2005 dynasty
<|emo_joy|> If your dog is an arctic breed they will go crazy with joy and be sad that you don’t share in their happiness for the bitter cold.

<|emo_joy|> saved... i'll enjoy this video
"<|emo_surprise|> I found a shirt hanging on a pants hanger last week, but not even between the clippy parts."
<|emo_anger|> they just want someone to agree with them and tell them they're right. that's all these sorts of posts ever are.
<|emo_joy|> So PST it is. Glad we agree.
"<|emo_disgust|> I spent a week in Ottawa one night. Amazing architecture but awful, filthy, drug infested city. Terrible ppl and a dirty trash hole."
<|emo_joy|> Ohhh. [NAME] is my absolute favorite person ever. She just gets better as the season goes on. Enjoy!
<|emo_sad|> so obnoxious.
<|emo_fear|> Cause emotions are difficult and people fear rejection
<|emo_sad|> I can understand political acrimony but the death of humor is really disappointing. Very sad indeed.
<|emo_sad|> Sacrifice the individuals rights for the greater good of the community. That's the definition of fascism.
<|emo_anger|> “Don’t discipline my kid!”
<|emo_disgust|> I would vote no to a United Ireland because the Republic doesn't have a free health service and no free prescriptions
<|emo_anger|> YOU UNDERESTIMATE MY POWER!!!
<|emo_surprise|> Wow what a final quarter. [NAME] throwing two intersepts. What a dog
<|emo_sad|> Growing up there were people in our church who hated the Smurfs because they were magic using communists.
<|emo_disgust|> Worst case scenario here is he dodged a psychopathic bullet.
"<|emo_sad|> To each according to their needs... Except entitled parents, who need everything."
<|emo_anger|> ITS MAM!
<|emo_surprise|> So [NAME] proved that they are not literally selling their workers into sex slavery. That's a pretty low bar!!
"<|emo_surprise|> They already put extra seasoning to account for this, opening it upside down is just gonna give you super oily hands. "
<|emo_surprise|> oh my [NAME]

<|emo_sad|> It doesn’t look cool
<|emo_surprise|> **I can't believe she held out for a full 24 hours before flip-flopping**
<|emo_disgust|> This girl is really hot. tight biker suit and all that.
<|emo_anger|> The supplement industry is another scam. Multi billion dollar industry. Stop wasting your money on GNC prework out drinks and go straight to the real source.
<|emo_anger|> lol dont try and fucking blame [NAME] for not passing it to a guy who has been bricking all night.
<|emo_sad|> I am but me and my SO live separate lives.
<|emo_joy|> Our games against San Fran always seem to have amazing finishes
<|emo_sad|> It usually comes out after people catch me dissociating.
<|emo_disgust|> Seeing him RT rev gave me some hope which hurts worse
<|emo_fear|> [Serious] I'm fairly certain this poster has Asperger's Syndrome or OCD or some other mental disorder. He obsessively fixates on really really weird subjects.

<|emo_surprise|> I'm actually heartened that I'm not the only one that thinks about that group. wonder if men ponder on it.
"<|emo_anger|> I honestly thought that they could have chosen ""bigger"" words than those, [NAME] clearly knew what they meant!"
<|emo_fear|> There are no helpful ideas like the one you're looking for. There is only one idea... Tell your parents and get authorities involved.
<|emo_joy|> 10/10. The end had me rolling tho lol. Got me at the right moment.
"<|emo_sad|> You made me cry. That rarely happens, it's like poetry. Someone gets me. Someone feels my pain. Thank you."

<|emo_joy|> I appreciate the pointer. It definitely sounds like something I’m capable of. I’ll reach out to them.
<|emo_joy|> I’m just glad to finally see something truly cringy in a while
<|emo_surprise|> This can't be real...
<|emo_anger|> Your just killing time now.
<|emo_sad|> Rip [NAME] and [NAME] if [NAME] exposes everything to [NAME]
<|emo_sad|> Omg this is repulsive
<|emo_anger|> And here I thought it was just my phone... damn what a horrible site.
<|emo_surprise|> What? You don't know what punishment is?
"<|emo_joy|> Including the fact that once I pirate something, i usually will purchase it later on either through frustration / poor quality/ actually loving the product / etc"
<|emo_anger|> I would absolutely hate it if they used it in the games tbh
"<|emo_sad|> correct me if i’m wrong but when [NAME] eliminates [NAME], she technically has a better track record than [NAME]?? i’ll fucking cry"
<|emo_surprise|> That glo up though. Omg 😍😍😍
<|emo_sad|> Pretty sure the legislature needs to change laws
"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, it's disgusting & I'm so disturbed by everything going on. Never ever would I have believed this is where people were headed. "
<|emo_anger|> They’re so angry!
<|emo_disgust|> Combination of lapses in defense and the continuing saga of the Sabres' god awful PP.
<|emo_anger|> Unbelievable! Here. Have your iPad back. Not interested in being treated like a criminal. I’ll write home with pen and paper
<|emo_surprise|> Look like when i wake up in the same bed with my uncle
"<|emo_disgust|> Hey, at least its not a fucking sauce post! We really need a new season."
<|emo_disgust|> I'm still a little surprised at how god awful that defense was. The Bengals definitely have some talent to work with.
<|emo_disgust|> Imagine running willingly into a new pair of broken ribs.
<|emo_surprise|> Ahem....Repost Alert!
"<|emo_anger|> The shipping container are my friends, damnit"
<|emo_joy|> my favorite moment in the history of the show is when he thrashed that woman.
<|emo_surprise|> The internet never ceases to surprise
<|emo_fear|> I’m afraid I just blue myself
"<|emo_surprise|> That looks like before Fox even owned it, I was surprised to see it's almost been 30 years"
<|emo_fear|> This is really scary. The saddest about this is i really think it will be possible quite soon. :(
"<|emo_joy|> Wouldn't that be the western sky? Also very beautiful pic, OP."
<|emo_joy|> Maybe try to do some little thing you really used to enjoy. Even if it's just for 5 mins it's still a small victory.
<|emo_sad|> Lots of botox. That face doesn't move. She has to squint her eyes to indicate to others that she is mad.
"<|emo_joy|> Just a friend, chill"
<|emo_anger|> Dude I have a verrrrry strong feeling the barber did that on purpose. Nowhere in the world is that an acceptable haircut. That’s fucked up
<|emo_joy|> You too! Yay to a family of choice!
<|emo_surprise|> Girl gets pregnant. Start selling my services to infertile couples. It’s a miracle. Profit.
"<|emo_joy|> Different personalities, I've always been like that with friends and family."
<|emo_sad|> I BELIEVE! I am sad that likely no one else will see it besides me...
<|emo_anger|> As much as I hate [NAME] I love the guy a lot
<|emo_anger|> Yes that was abuse.
<|emo_anger|> A fatass? Look at him. You think he cares about his appearance? He’s likely talking about alcohol anyway.
<|emo_disgust|> Is it weird that I was practically drooling while watching this
<|emo_fear|> So. This is scary as fuck.
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, I would refuse to do anything really nasty, with profanity or violence."
<|emo_anger|> Trash princess makes me imagine a possum with a little tiara.
<|emo_sad|> the older i get the more it hurts
<|emo_surprise|> And you wonder why Labour get's a bad name for anti-Semitism with statements like that. Ok hun.
<|emo_joy|> All good brother
"<|emo_surprise|> Honestly after he was so reasonable and calm throughout this confrontation, the hatchet man tattoo made me chuckle. Definitely unexpected."
<|emo_sad|> This is awesome. You can really see how little wasted motion [NAME] had—everything looked effortless.
<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit! Did not see that coming! Gonna miss you [NAME] :(
<|emo_joy|> mystery solved.
<|emo_joy|> I did that a lot as well. I always loved going with her.
<|emo_surprise|> I feel like I went out to get the pizzas and I came back to my apartment on fire.
"<|emo_fear|> >Some ~~drugs~~ people are just... Scary... Some drugs tend to bring out what's bubbling under the surface, so in that way, yeah. "
"<|emo_sad|> Agreed. Sadly, it's not uncommon enough, and it makes me sad because of the implications about mutual respect or the lack thereof."
<|emo_joy|> Ah yes. Red Dead 2. My favorite movie
<|emo_sad|> The poor car.
<|emo_joy|> I bet she smells like a jar of mayo left open for a week in the summer
<|emo_disgust|> Pepsi tastes better in the UK than Coke but US/Canada coke is pure diabetes and Pepsi is disgusting.
<|emo_joy|> Luckily my wages are rising faster to compensate. Oh wait...
"<|emo_sad|> Sadly too easy to gank. Bronze brawl 4-man notices you are split pushing, you are dead."
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is not good enough to get that angry.
"<|emo_anger|> I can hear [NAME] now: ""Why don't I have a mic why don't I have a mic FUCK I need a mic"""
<|emo_surprise|> I'm more surprised the dash cam was functioning properly. Usually around these incidents 3 of them were not recording and one had the lens cap on...
<|emo_fear|> No! That's horrible news!..for Galaxy fans lol
<|emo_surprise|> Got to love all the fake fans that know nothing about hockey!
<|emo_joy|> Where did you get those tunnels? I love them and would like some myself!
<|emo_sad|> You're saying it's depressing to see someone eating whilst other people are starving.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow misleading title.. Ffs
<|emo_surprise|> Got damn look at that body
"<|emo_disgust|> They hated [NAME] since the beginning of [RELIGION], they treated them like animals"
<|emo_sad|> stop hurting my feelings
<|emo_anger|> The Netflix documentary about [NAME] absolutely sucks. Don't waste your time.
<|emo_sad|> I was waiting for that but this isn't r/nononono or r/Holdmybeer
<|emo_disgust|> This is one of those hobbies where the exit strategy is paralysis or death.
"<|emo_sad|> That's really the only standard of your life, whether or not it makes liberals furious? Sad."
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh so it is a separate guy filming, it’s actually impressive how synced up their speeds are"
<|emo_fear|> “Got caught talking about meditation” Sounds terrible I am so sorry you had to go through that kind of thought policing.
"<|emo_surprise|> Huh, I was just wondering if something like this existed. I'm working in food manafacturing an this would be epic."
<|emo_disgust|> I swear these people would try to sell shoes to someone without feet.
<|emo_surprise|> Tbh it really is a long name. And pretty unusual for a ring name.
<|emo_surprise|> Ouch! My hear sank. Don’t do this to me.
"<|emo_surprise|> Really? In real life, she's wearing comfortable clothes with no makeup. Other than that she looks the same."
<|emo_disgust|> He is just awful enough to do something like that.
"<|emo_disgust|> *She. This was posted by a woman, apparently. Its just as disgusting either way though."
"<|emo_joy|> with his luxurious salary, nice pension and zero accountability for anything it does, its a hard old life!!!"
<|emo_surprise|> How did I not know this?! That show is so good.
"<|emo_joy|> Haha, I love that! :) I'll see if he's interested now"
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] what an asshole.
<|emo_sad|> It’s hard to be negative in that situation.
"<|emo_surprise|>  ### A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one "
<|emo_surprise|> I thought I was the only knicks/browns fan on this sub! That's cool. But yeah I love hearing him and clyde do broadcasts
<|emo_fear|> Try wearing something unattractive when that student is around.
"<|emo_joy|> Could not agree more. Personally, I love watching any comp at pro level. GOATS is fun to watch the micro play and ability timings and synergy "
<|emo_disgust|> Soon: Mass death of pink-skinned Aussies.
<|emo_surprise|> Just happened to me lol
"<|emo_surprise|> Stolen valor, there's no way someone who is actually in the military wouldn't understand this. You're a POSER"
<|emo_anger|> I regret this post so hard so much debate and anger lol
<|emo_sad|> And I'm crying. But you're so right. Thank you.
<|emo_disgust|> You look like 1 of those ISIS fighters got shot in the head
"<|emo_joy|> Just hit my 3pl8 squat, been looking forward to this for a long time so really happy I finally got it! Now on to 4"
<|emo_surprise|> Oh 100%. And I could see [NAME] & [NAME] both picking [NAME] cause of how she wanted to play the game.
<|emo_sad|> Ouch. Rough year for the jags. Where upstate are you?
"<|emo_fear|> Oh, you had me worried there! Still if it doesn't then what can you do I suppose."
<|emo_joy|> lol I hope no-one bothers to answer you in earnest honesty because you are so childish it'll just wash right over your ears.
<|emo_joy|> Congrats to you
"<|emo_joy|> That sounds awful )-: I'm so grateful that my parents and therapist want to let me figure this out with minimal ""supervision"""
<|emo_joy|> Have to stay positive! I AM getting a new job I love in the field I want to work in!
<|emo_surprise|> beautiful story arc. glad you decided to end it in my semi hometown of excelsior - really neat lil town.
<|emo_joy|> uwu guess i have to do it too
<|emo_disgust|> Except for the part where it grows in with that awful shape people make because they can only see themselves in the mirror.
<|emo_fear|> It scares me that left to right is also possible for anyone
"<|emo_joy|> I don't find it awkward, it's relaxing and I want to enjoy having some else wash and cut my hair."
<|emo_joy|> I actually really like it the way it is now! The pink sky with only a few clouds is different and very cool.
<|emo_disgust|> >fail at reading comprehension >Other guy must be a troll ¯_(ツ)_/¯
"<|emo_joy|> Nihilism makes me happy, but I know that’s just my opinion."
<|emo_surprise|> omg so quirky
<|emo_surprise|> I had a second date yesterday with such bad breath! I gave him a pass on the first date because we met online.
"<|emo_anger|> Try ""turn that shite aff!"""
<|emo_joy|> I thought it was funny ‍♀️
<|emo_surprise|> NL West had 3 teams in the playoffs in 2017 and 2 in 2018......wtf you on about
"<|emo_sad|> Yeh pretty rough. I mean we all know [NAME] won, but it was much closer than that "
<|emo_joy|> -9 and I’m out shopping. Sun is out feels great.
<|emo_sad|> The only part of church I'm sad my kids will miss.
<|emo_anger|> I've always hated the 610/45 interchange. Everyone slows to a crawl when there is no need to slow down.
<|emo_anger|> No it’s a lie because he could not possibly have been in Vietnam. And he did not correct a single outlet who said he was.
<|emo_joy|> Haha okay. Much love brother!
<|emo_sad|> It’s kinda sad that this made me lol.
"<|emo_anger|> So just tell me I dont want to go look, was the video cut/edited? Or is it RAW? I MUST KNOW!"
"<|emo_sad|> using the crying emoji is a sin against humanity, and you should be executed via the electric chair for doing so. "
<|emo_joy|> I laughed at this
<|emo_surprise|> Wow! You must have pretty low standards for teachers in your state/school! I guess that's why Massachusetts is always first for education.
<|emo_fear|> You're right! What a nightmare.
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME], is this the new transphobia specific ""Post Hog""? Because it really should be."
<|emo_anger|> This was a hate crime. Cut and dried.
<|emo_joy|> Oh la la
"<|emo_joy|> Look! More complaining about people complaining, thus compounding the issue! What a happy little circle-jerk : ) You guys will never stop."
<|emo_joy|> So now you’ve been given several answers.
"<|emo_sad|> I believe that any country that has hungry people, and too many animals in the shelters, doesnt have a food problem, it has a priority problem. "
"<|emo_surprise|> Whoa, wasn't expecting a rational take on this here on reddit. Well done."
"<|emo_surprise|> Checked my EBT balance yesterday. ""You will not be receiving benefits for February."". I wonder when the riots are going to start."
<|emo_anger|> ARGH!!
<|emo_joy|> Made my day!
<|emo_disgust|> He ain’t lying. I’ve seen the way he eats tacos!
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] would love it if we rolled over into the hypocrisy of pacifism. The only problem I have with punching [NAME] is making sure your aim is correct.
"<|emo_surprise|> Kind of astonishing to see AstroKatie is completely unaware of everything unchecked migration has done to Sweden, France, Germany, etc etc etc."
"<|emo_surprise|> Hahaha I wish I was that witty at the time, I think I was still in naive shock at the rudeness of people in retail. "
<|emo_surprise|> Hard to believe we scored like 8 points through the first 6 minutes.
<|emo_surprise|> Is that seriously the story? I haven’t googled it. I just thought it was cool as a WW2 buff
<|emo_anger|> Well son of a....
"<|emo_anger|> > You have no shame. This is just more Ad Hominem FFS! You really can't help yourself, can you? "
<|emo_sad|> Mom will get sad. [NAME] still good. Hanging out with friends still good. Money buying foodie exp is still good.
<|emo_fear|> Right!? I'm glad someone else noticed. I was horrified when she trespassed into a stranger's home. So violating!
<|emo_joy|> None that's why I asked. Glad to see your doing something and not just wishing or whining as that wont make it happen
<|emo_disgust|> Or just get the fuck out and never look back.
<|emo_anger|> Real class A asshole there
<|emo_surprise|> OH MY GOOSE! You got my super obscure reference! I literally squealed out loud when I read this comment.
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] what do you do with his underwEAR
<|emo_fear|> I want to get off [NAME] wild ride
<|emo_fear|> Was expecting a horrifically broken ankle. You have posted the actually unexpected
"<|emo_joy|> haha I'm guessing she doesn't spark joy for you, so you can let her go "
<|emo_surprise|> I'm a guy and I'm squirming. My wife asked me what the hell I was reading and I told her. She said wtf really loud.
"<|emo_disgust|> You can't be worse than [NAME], your hired!"
<|emo_disgust|> Can't help that the president hangs out with the bottom of the barrel.
<|emo_disgust|> This is child abuse. No decent parent would force their kid to starve just because they don't understand science and nutrition
<|emo_surprise|> That season 2 opener was great and completely unexpected.
<|emo_anger|> I bet if anyone else had his condition without being a Veteran would have served some sort of punishment.
<|emo_anger|> I still hated the system though. I felt penalized for using anything that wasn't the power beam the entire game.
<|emo_joy|> Hooray for the cancer! /s
<|emo_joy|> He probably enjoyed it so much with his frat brothers that he's willing to buck his own party for good weed.
"<|emo_anger|> Just because you lack critical thinking and reading skills doesnt mean i am a moron, it means you need to learn how to think for yourself."
<|emo_disgust|> Pure unadulterated hatred. It’s disgusting.
"<|emo_joy|> Don't worry, you'll get to keep your same plan. It'll just double in price."
"<|emo_joy|> I'm interested, more than I should be."
"<|emo_surprise|> the father sending up 4 donuts every morning via stair lift to dtr, before she even comes down to breakfast, wonders if he is enabling her."
<|emo_sad|> It's in my garage. Couldn't be any easier to access it.
<|emo_anger|> Those women are the worst.
"<|emo_anger|> It's not his fault, it's your wife's. Shes the one you need to be pissed at"
<|emo_anger|> the fuck is wrong with this guy
<|emo_anger|> READ A BOOK YOU FUCKING CROOK.
"<|emo_anger|> Whaaaat no way, you can’t play it with other people? "
<|emo_anger|> How the hell
<|emo_disgust|> This is so bad that I immediately retold it to everyone I know.
<|emo_sad|> Aaaand everybody got diarrhea. Thanks dummy
<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry OP but this is all on you. Your parents played you like a $4000 fiddle.
<|emo_surprise|> He looks like he’s trying to blow shit up with his mind
<|emo_disgust|> These are the signs I'm getting old... Wtf is a weed cartridge??
<|emo_disgust|> That's quite a lot worse tbh
"<|emo_sad|> Well it didn’t work that well, I mean... they lost"
<|emo_anger|> Well if he takes his daughter to a nightclub then that’s a bit inappropriate
<|emo_anger|> It was or I’d have walked out!! Lol!
<|emo_joy|> Omg I thought you were paraphrasing. I'm so happy that those were the exact words they said.
<|emo_joy|> Honestly- live your life as a person who can love what others hate- because that’s just a little more joy in your life versus their hate.
<|emo_surprise|> Massive overlap. I have been vegan for 10 years and anti birth around the same time for the reasons you note.
"<|emo_anger|> I am serious, and don't call me [NAME]."
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] these are hideous
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, season 3 is actually out already. Need to check it out"
"<|emo_fear|> Couldn't really fit this as a ""how to,"" does that mean I have to go to jail now? Source: "
<|emo_surprise|> Wow I bet someone would look at this and get inspired to make a movie about aliens with [NAME]
<|emo_anger|> It was deloitte wasn't it. That is some bullshit application.
<|emo_sad|> Kid looks like he's about to cry
"<|emo_joy|> I can name a favorite verse in the bible, it’s that one yknow, the one with [NAME] and [NAME]!"
<|emo_anger|> I immediately block these shitheads/asshats
<|emo_sad|> Some people might be into that. There are some freaky people out there.
"<|emo_disgust|> I don’t cry, either. It’s weird. I think it’s a personality/mentality thing. Just depends on how your brain is wired I think"
<|emo_sad|> The poor car.
"<|emo_sad|> Yep, lack of proper coaching yet again. Sucks we missed out on [NAME]. "
"<|emo_joy|> Nothing happens. However, I'm glad that ICOs have ceased to appear. "
<|emo_joy|> It is so crazy to me that people unironcally use “kicks their trash”. I guess they just don’t want to swear.
<|emo_joy|> This person is being a killjoy but there is a difference between being a killjoy and acting smart.
<|emo_disgust|> They said that about Standard Oil as well. No company is too big to fail provided the state is stirred enough to take serious action.
"<|emo_fear|> Yah, totally. It's just kind of scary when all you hear are loud extremes on both sides. "
<|emo_sad|> Well 216 is out now and Im crying. [NAME] why?
<|emo_sad|> You had a tough childhood :(
<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I can save $15 and buy this used version?!?!? How wonderful!
<|emo_sad|> It’s very difficult for men to have platonic friendships with women. Unfortunately it’s just part of life.
<|emo_joy|> I enjoy gameplay grind. Don't shoot me lol.
<|emo_joy|> My blood pressure Edit: I'm just happy to be here.
"<|emo_sad|> She doesn't sound like a good girlfriend then, assuming you've done nothing to warrant such jealousy."
<|emo_surprise|> Wow Jurassic Park looks a lot different than in the cinema
<|emo_anger|> I feel a little sad for her. That she thinks the only options or something to do is having kids. Fuck her tho.
<|emo_anger|> The third period is going to be uncomfortable and I preemptively hate it.
"<|emo_anger|> ...oh goddamn it, that's in my sales territory."
<|emo_joy|> Saving this. Happy 2019 to ya!
<|emo_joy|> Thanks man! That feels good to hear. I’m glad someone is on my side and finally understanding how I feel about this season.😄👍
<|emo_joy|> Glad to see that thoughtful doggo found a home here!
<|emo_sad|> This hurts to watch
"<|emo_disgust|> I hate the message that's being pushed, and it's even worse that it's being pushed by this guy."
"<|emo_joy|> Usually it's not entertainment, it's mostly curiosity and fascination. Like when you see something horrible, but can't turn your eyes away."
"<|emo_joy|> I'm so happy that this worked for you! Go forth, and have unashamed sex in my honour."
"<|emo_joy|> I was Isla Vista, beautiful and terrible place"
<|emo_surprise|> That's a weird way of spelling Disenchanted
<|emo_anger|> Will forever be burned into my brain! Will never forget the feeling just please not 2 cycles in a row 🙏🏻
<|emo_anger|> She talks about him getting some manners... She's the only without manners... and she should've gotten kicked off...
"<|emo_disgust|> He had one poor split, and he already looks strong, fuck your mindless hate"
<|emo_sad|> Drunk and crying in bed with my pets. :|
"<|emo_anger|> It's not his fault, it's your wife's. Shes the one you need to be pissed at"
<|emo_disgust|> What a useless answer in this situation
<|emo_sad|> My daughter attempted in November of 2012. She also still struggles. Glad you’re BOTH still alive!
<|emo_sad|> Oop my bad
<|emo_joy|> Its fun to draw in an empty space.
<|emo_sad|> I miss the bch/bsv war...the quality of posts were getting better....back to square 1
<|emo_anger|> Oh boy I was wide awake when I lost my under 51.5. [NAME] can go fuck his ugly self
<|emo_joy|> No problem. I'm happy to know it's not what you meant.
<|emo_surprise|> So. Much. *Effort.* I ca't believe a tree died for this sin.
"<|emo_joy|> Funny, no. Unsurprising, yes."
<|emo_anger|> Except forming an opinion of a topic without even having basic knowledge of said topic makes you sound pretty arrogant and entirely undercuts your opinion.
<|emo_anger|> He raped her. What is wrong with you? Go back to Incels.
<|emo_disgust|> A year ago I said that this continuous ISO by Houston is disgusting to watch. It s still disgusting.
<|emo_joy|> Good for you man. Enjoy.
<|emo_joy|> I almost thought this was gonna turn into a story of your tissue you'd been reusing for months. I'm glad it was not lol
<|emo_sad|> The only death that made me feel any emotion. And it wasn’t even the death itself.
<|emo_disgust|> You are disgusting.
<|emo_surprise|> Doesn't suck nearly as bad as Metropolitan Grill. I'm surprised that place is still open.
"<|emo_joy|> Okay fine. Still though. Make some joke ""maybe we should cuddle for warmth"" and see how she responds. "
"<|emo_disgust|> I don't know what you're talking about, but that sounds just as racist as it is sexist."
<|emo_surprise|> Surprised they aren't already doing this kind of stuff for Zion.
"<|emo_joy|> ""Holding [NAME] up like baby [NAME] would be a fantastic way to excite a fan base that’s been neglected for years."""
<|emo_joy|> Better get yourself here before March 😂
<|emo_sad|> oml I’m so sorry OP for all that
<|emo_fear|> I'm actually scared to find out what kind of thing you could get for breakfast there. I won't check.
<|emo_disgust|> Bless this woman. That honestly sounds horrific from every end. I hope her ex [NAME] has lived a horrendous life since perpetuating that disgusting act.
"<|emo_sad|> While Girl Scout Cookies and weed are old friends, I am unfortunately not in contact with a dealer of the latter!"
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] fucking christ. When [NAME] came into the league he was pretty much as skinny as [NAME] is now. And look at the dude now.
<|emo_surprise|> Who would have thought people were going to be using the Padres for their fake news to generate clicks. This is nuts.
<|emo_sad|> Fingerprints not [NAME] or [NAME] red is [NAME] don’t just make things up now that is sad !
"<|emo_fear|> As horrible as it is to say, evidently the voting population doesn't care enough to make a large impact. "
"<|emo_sad|> Hi u/CareeningDirigibug, thanks for posting this however I am afraid it has been removed as this video has already been posted within the last week. Hope you understand."
"<|emo_joy|> Proof of [NAME] love for mankind, beer and dogs. Love both and abuse neither."
<|emo_surprise|> Weird. He's like the one capitalist in this sub that I feel I've had substantive conversations with.
"<|emo_sad|> I couldn't even get an internship for Human Resources without having 2-3 years 'Real World' experience. Still in customer service, with a ton of debt. "
<|emo_joy|> Feeling this so hard right now. Virtual hug.
<|emo_anger|> hell yeah dude
<|emo_joy|> We could cure child cancer and pictures like this would still make me happier
<|emo_anger|> Not to be harsh but I feel like she has been dieting and working out for quite some time .. wouldn’t there be some change by now ?
<|emo_sad|> Thank you for saying that I just haven’t felt right and I’m so sad constantly
"<|emo_sad|> Due to work, gotta stay legal. Edibles aren’t legal yet sadly. Fortunately not taking it for cancer though, just pain."
<|emo_anger|> It's piss but its [NAME] piss so you make your move.
<|emo_fear|> That was worse than a movie jump scare. I don't know why but giant squid feel more fearsome than sharks.
<|emo_sad|> It's so really sad how praising the Creator ([NAME]) has become something associated with terrorism... Astaghfirullah.
<|emo_joy|> Wow! What a joyous companion--for each of them. How wonderful!!!
"<|emo_sad|> It sucks being unattractive. It pisses me off that there are so many beautiful people in the world, and I ain't one of them."
<|emo_joy|> My nightmare is having an iphone.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow! Dude has aged well. Maybe I need some of that snek oil!
<|emo_anger|> And fake papers are probably dwarfed by genuine but bad papers. So what?
<|emo_disgust|> You don’t have to hate players just for being on a different team. I hate that [NAME] is an [NAME]. I don’t hate [NAME]
"<|emo_sad|> “Jinkies, unmasking the monster is such a pain... Nyeeeeeeeeh~.”"
<|emo_anger|> I do the 4-second gap as well and is it infuriating to see someone take advantage of it.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, this is bizarre. Well, I agree too. A wealth tax is exactly what we need."
<|emo_anger|> PARENTS: VACCINATE YOUR FUCKING KIDS OR THE NEXT NAP THEY TAKE WILL BE IN A COFFIN OMFG
"<|emo_anger|> Does that idiot not realize he's roasting himself by calling [NAME] a bad lawyer? You worked with him for a decade, moron."
<|emo_sad|> I'm so sorry. Hang in there.
<|emo_surprise|> I really like the colours but I'm wondering where that bit of shadow on the chin comes from.
<|emo_sad|> Kid looks like he's about to cry
"<|emo_anger|> Welcome to racial integration, where your civility standards are racist and you better shut up or else."
"<|emo_sad|> No, what’s sad is saying the same message like it’s news. He’s a copy paste machine. No original thought."
<|emo_joy|> Lol thats Why i lose my Games cuz i Play with bots like you. Do the World a favor and go back too minecraft Lol
<|emo_anger|> I still think hating [NAME] isn't a good move for them. Could turn those undocumented [NAME] into undocumented [NAME].
<|emo_sad|> I cried more here than in Star Wars.
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] is such a gift. I love him.
<|emo_fear|> Worth reading if you worry about
<|emo_disgust|> My mother did this. This isn't just a millennial thing.
"<|emo_anger|> Governments aren't generally considered ""monopolies"". You can't have two governments (at the same level). "
"<|emo_anger|> Peeps poisoned our water supply, burned our crops, and delivered a plague unto our houses!"
<|emo_anger|> How DARE you!
"<|emo_sad|> we have a ""righty"" complaining about ""lefties"" making up BS, while they make up BS... sad."
<|emo_surprise|> Wow what's it like to be so petty? (Fixed)
<|emo_surprise|> I’m surprised they find toothpaste still
<|emo_anger|> It's not a question of law; it's a matter of school policy.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. Thanks! So this person was going for that.
<|emo_joy|> I actually have the complete collection so I can play any of them when I want to!
<|emo_anger|> you dirty karma theft

<|emo_joy|> Happy for you!
<|emo_surprise|> My [NAME]. I think we have a winner. IT'S. A. REAL. PLACE. Best part
"<|emo_anger|> Yet, his recoveries on attacks are abysmal."
"<|emo_surprise|> Just saw that. CP3 era, wow I feel old "
"<|emo_fear|> I’m not waiting for help, I’m constantly trying to fix it myself but it would be nice if [NAME] help came"
<|emo_fear|> I'm surprised that this is still happening despite the threats of an invasion of manbij.
<|emo_sad|> I’m sorry. He’s in a better place. I hope you can keep the good memories
<|emo_sad|> damnit i've been enjoying the mutual pisstaking with my Swedish mate

"<|emo_disgust|> I've said it before, but yuck, kissing that bloody mouth... Watch out, [NAME], you don't know where that's been."
<|emo_disgust|> Justice for that horrendous no call
<|emo_joy|> The good news is you’re catching the possibility of it early. And medicine has come a long way! Giving you lots of good energy
<|emo_fear|> Yeah but then C diff turns into the hulk and then we’re REALLY screwed
"<|emo_sad|> You know we can see your post history, right? Orange fan sad."
<|emo_disgust|> That son of a bitch!
<|emo_fear|> Somebody is really insecure about their career decisions.
<|emo_surprise|> LOL...love nagy shock-faced

<|emo_surprise|> My [NAME] this Administration is somewhere between the mafia and the three stooges
"<|emo_disgust|> This live meet the queens is awkward AF, I’d rather them produce this and make us watch nicely edited stuff."
<|emo_disgust|> Weird. He's like the one capitalist in this sub that I feel I've had substantive conversations with.
<|emo_sad|> If we trade him I don’t think be will be a playoff team :(
"<|emo_anger|> Holy fuck, report this now. The fuck you doing on reddit? "
<|emo_anger|> People are idiots! No one should shame [NAME] for doing her job as a mom! Shame [NAME] instead for putting her kids' life in danger!
"<|emo_anger|> I'll kill you if you do that again, *honey*"
<|emo_anger|> That was brutal.
<|emo_disgust|> Because in some cases parents are basically having their own children kidnapped and held against their will and forced into these programs. This is child abuse.
<|emo_sad|> You absolutely dodged a bullet. You can be sad about it because it sucks to be broken up with but you def dodged a bullet.
<|emo_joy|> i think its cool because its a hybrid that comes in stickshift
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] 1st wife was his fucking cousin

<|emo_anger|> [NAME] I HATE those.
<|emo_sad|> It's sad how long it took me to get that. Haha got em
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry, I should have clarified that I meant when they determine your eligibility/payments in regards to the Repayment Assistance Program."
<|emo_surprise|> Honestly took me by surprised. Good job!
<|emo_joy|> Hell yeah it did!
"<|emo_joy|> Sounds like you two are really good together - cheers, and much happiness to you both!"
<|emo_sad|> I didn’t know I’m sorry
"<|emo_anger|> “WTF, He helped me? ...I’ll eat him last :)”"
<|emo_joy|> It’s fun until you’re looking back
<|emo_disgust|> And I call them alcoholics who can't hold a relationship together
"<|emo_anger|> You're really on a shit-posting streak lately. Something happen in your life that you need to talk about, bud?"
"<|emo_joy|> Hey, thank you. :) I appreciate it."
<|emo_fear|> I'm so afraid to weigh myself. I'm gonna have to do it soon though 😭
<|emo_anger|> So you're proudly ignorant. Cool bruh
<|emo_sad|> This gave me PTSD
<|emo_surprise|> It would have been more believable if he stated he was attacked by penguins wearing red hats.
"<|emo_joy|> Gore magala is my favorite monster in mh4u, you did an amazing job!"
"<|emo_anger|> Like women don’t have enough things to be judged on, now everyone is talking about our eyebrows..this is the most ridiculous trend to me. "
<|emo_disgust|> I want to call bs on this after smelling my boyfriend's. Have to leave the room whenever he lets one out...
<|emo_sad|> Topic change #4. This is getting sad.
<|emo_fear|> What a terrible list
<|emo_anger|> Bloody useless Pakistan
"<|emo_disgust|> He did. He needs the facial hair, and that haircut is horrible he should just shave it and start over."
"<|emo_joy|> No switch , option c) everyone comes together and wins in the good spirit of non-toxic competative overwatch"
<|emo_anger|> And you know they never grow out of that...I hate people. Myself included.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is just pretending to be uncoordinated while he plots to end careers
"<|emo_joy|> Wow. No words. America, the land of opportunity!!!!!"
<|emo_joy|> Taking a float plane is such a amazing experience - highly recommend!
<|emo_anger|> YOU STOLE MY GODDAMN COMMENT! <3
<|emo_fear|> That movie really scared me when I was a kid.
<|emo_anger|> The fuck is a fortnight? Like the game?
"<|emo_sad|> It's only 5 mins, but I hope this is the one. Sorry that happened to you friend."
<|emo_joy|> This was very helpful to me. Thanks for explaining it so well.
<|emo_anger|> I hate Detroit
"<|emo_joy|> Cheers, I will do "
<|emo_surprise|> Local man screams on >!cosplayer!< for absolutely no reason
<|emo_joy|> What’s the reference matter if it’s still insulting? Glad your degree is coming in handy for something.
<|emo_joy|> Lol get those pitchforks ready boys
<|emo_surprise|> wow so almost every sub has grown a lot in 7 months. Also 8.3k!! what!? that's insane
<|emo_joy|> This literally made my day!

<|emo_joy|> My mommas homemade mac and cheese almost makes me cry on how great it is
<|emo_joy|> That must have bean awesome to find those
"<|emo_sad|> Oh god, never thought of the implications of [NAME] not selling BB-8 as mirroring her parents giving her up. That tugs the heartstrings a little bit."
"<|emo_anger|> Dam boys, we announcing players back in training like new signings! "
<|emo_anger|> Why would they stop magicking away their shit. That seems more practical than a giant plumbing network.
"<|emo_anger|> It's ""soaked, frostbitten chic!"""
<|emo_sad|> That guy with the orange jacket looks so distraught. Feels bad man.
"<|emo_joy|> This is simply beautiful <3 thank you for sharing this, it touched my heart to hear such a wonderful success story <3"
<|emo_disgust|> Edited to “voters” that’s what I meant but I was getting a haircut and a little distracted.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wait, what? You're a gamer who's never even heard of TB?"
<|emo_sad|> I've isolated myself to the extent that i only focus my energy on myself/work.as lonely as it sounds its been such a breath of fresh air.
<|emo_sad|> cool... Sorry bro
"<|emo_sad|> It's probably more like when the only tool you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. I'm so sick of this paranoia."
<|emo_anger|> The story fits here -- arrogantly oblivious customers from a different viewpoint.
"<|emo_fear|> I think it was, it was do scary, i honestly never wanna do that stuff again"
<|emo_anger|> Agreed. Everything she did was bad. She didn't anything good at all. Edit: Grammar.
"<|emo_sad|> Watching Revenge sometimes makes me cry, thinking back to when I tried to memorize that song, and listened to it over and over."
<|emo_fear|> I think the teacher was right though. Money would make a terrible aggregate.
"<|emo_fear|> Threaten to release....welp , nothing coming from this."
<|emo_disgust|> > they look like such fucking OCs. [NAME] designed them I don't know what you expected. He phones in video games all the time.
<|emo_joy|> Super glad this is now all nice and official! Really looking forward to working the NGS peeps!
"<|emo_joy|> That sounds like a hot date. ;) I've never been, but friends say just order the cheapest food and enjoy the ambiance."
<|emo_joy|> Idk you seem pretty miserable and really bitter and angry. It must be exhausting and I hope you find happiness some day.
<|emo_joy|> Got a good laugh out of that. Plenty of wall of shame material.
<|emo_disgust|> Idiots are downvoting your correct comment.
<|emo_anger|> Who the hell has all these power tools but no hammer
<|emo_joy|> Happy belated cakeday.
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad you liked it :D
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] was the same in Crestwood. Scary as hell.
"<|emo_fear|> Nah, black bears are big scaredy cats Now brown ones on the other hand..."
<|emo_surprise|> wow even the buildings on the poster haven't loaded in
<|emo_joy|> It would be hilarious if it was a pasta place too
"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, I want some! "
<|emo_anger|> Because it's not mildlyinfuriating that you have to ask strangers to not be assholes?
<|emo_anger|> Really? Shucks! I’ve never seen it...thought it was a perfect add. My bad.
"<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. If I were a celebrity, I would probably do the same."
<|emo_sad|> I know and that made me sad!
"<|emo_sad|> ""antibiotics I had left over from last year"" THERE IS EVERYTHING WRONG WITH THIS STATEMENT"
"<|emo_joy|> Hey if any are left, I'd like to happily donate!"
"<|emo_anger|> Collusion! Nah but seriously, Knicks need to fall back. "
<|emo_disgust|> And fake papers are probably dwarfed by genuine but bad papers. So what?
<|emo_joy|> Yeah I'm glad he got caught. What a piece of crap.well at least he won't be a virgin in jail anymore haha
<|emo_sad|> It still hurts 15 years later. I don't know how people can be so callous their own child
<|emo_sad|> I hate it and I love it.
<|emo_joy|> Amazing detail with the hot dog in the virgins hand.
<|emo_sad|> Whoops!! I totally didn’t realize ‍♀️
<|emo_surprise|> Oh god. Imagine losing to Toronto in the cup final. You would spent the rest of your life hearing about it
<|emo_surprise|> Pilots omg... you are not alone there!
<|emo_sad|> My score per minute is terrible because I only snipe so asking the wrong person. Sorry dude
<|emo_anger|> > why have all of my responses been restating my opinion Because you're cruising on righteous indignation rather than empirical evidence. Facts don't care about your feelings.
<|emo_anger|> Its like the worlds most infuriating reality show.
"<|emo_sad|> Unfortunately for you, no one of importance cares about your absurd views. "
<|emo_anger|> That it just seems worst now because we have phones (instant media)
<|emo_sad|> Sick BURN!
<|emo_sad|> My bad.
<|emo_joy|> Try it sometime man. You may just enjoy it
<|emo_joy|> Good to know 😊
<|emo_disgust|> I really despise that woman.
"<|emo_fear|> I dont mind these people dying, what bothers me is that some random bystander could be smashed by this guy should he fall"
"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, my two favorite franchises and the two best girls!!"
"<|emo_fear|> IMO there are quite a few jobs that are criminally underpaid, but that's just me."
<|emo_anger|> Keep pressuring the landlord. Threaten to sue them if they don't take care of the problem.
<|emo_surprise|> I've always wondered how cases where an individual gets a 7 or 8 figure sum issued against them work in practice
"<|emo_anger|> By ranting aimlessly on the internet about it, obviously ;)"
<|emo_disgust|> HAS THE WHOLE WORLD GONE CRAZY‽ AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO GIVES A SHIT ABOUT THE RULES‽ MARK IT ZERO!
<|emo_surprise|> omg this is a bit too relatable
"<|emo_sad|> My nipples are rock hard right now, just ruined my shirt. "
"<|emo_sad|> This is just sad. So, so sad."
<|emo_anger|> I am getting a lot of weird replies...
<|emo_sad|> This hurts to watch
"<|emo_disgust|> Take a shower brother, i can smell you through my phone"
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] awful.
<|emo_fear|> I love the way you phrased that. I do believe she is terribly afraid to look inward at herself.
<|emo_sad|> Unfortunately not. 😏
"<|emo_disgust|> Dear [NAME], please help [NAME] be less disgusting. Amen."
"<|emo_surprise|> I didn’t know [NAME] was a boxer, he can take a punch though!"
<|emo_surprise|> The amount of hate that [RELIGION] people get in the world is absolutely staggering.
<|emo_joy|> Pleasure!:)
<|emo_anger|> OHH this is what Reddit finds ridiculous about this situation.
<|emo_surprise|> What? You don't know what punishment is?
"<|emo_surprise|> Even after achieving 100% in this game, his performance still amazes me."
<|emo_anger|> That damn FDR who America loved so much they had to write an amendment to the Constitution to keep anyone else from being elected that many times
"<|emo_sad|> No, but its a big problem in itself. "
"<|emo_joy|> Now is the fun part, where you try to maintain this lifestyle."
"<|emo_surprise|> I've honestly looked at mine and thought, I wonder if it'd keep my cup of coffee hot."
"<|emo_anger|> Ok, I get a feeling that you might be a bit too radical here. I'm not going to keep trying here, have a nice day."
"<|emo_anger|> If I ever see that in my area, that will be a bullet to the head. Fuck Reddit's rules."
<|emo_anger|> Because I have no self-control and I hate myself.
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME] all at top tier make me happy"
"<|emo_joy|> Great deal for us, happy he's back. Up next, [NAME]! "
<|emo_disgust|> I never think someone is sincere when they say why “would I care if I’m being lied to” constantly?
<|emo_surprise|> Definitely surprised we took out [NAME] there. We needed to finish the quarter strong and it went straight to shit when he left.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Have that much debit in your bovada account is something crazy. Props to you
"<|emo_joy|> Really? Edit: Ah yea, I saw the original one. It still reminds me of Wind Maker."
<|emo_anger|> Stop gaslighting. It's gross.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow... drug smugglers will always find a way I guess. I bet that took a ton of work
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] fucked up with this line up. Why do you change it, if everything was going good? Idiot! "
"<|emo_anger|> I figured this story would end with her screaming, ""I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE... THIS IS A CAR.. TAKE ME HOME!!!"""
"<|emo_disgust|> See, this is what films lack nowadays, taking real risks with implications of [NAME] on Animal fart sex. Bravo [NAME]!"
<|emo_fear|> Right?? It makes no sense she’s horrible
"<|emo_anger|> How dare you care about your physical and mental health, you shitlord you! /s"
<|emo_disgust|> A derogatory term.
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] [NAME], you made me think I was going colorblind for a second! How are there more colors in your rainbow than in mine?"
"<|emo_fear|> I actually see this one a lot. ""Allergy: fire ants."" Me too, bro. Ants will fuck you up."
<|emo_disgust|> Stop saying that ? Makes my tummy upset 🤢🤮
"<|emo_sad|> He's controversial from what I know. A canny leader to be sure, but his coziness with Dominion Energy has unnerved some [NAME]. "
"<|emo_sad|> Dude, she had just lost her baby, too. "
<|emo_joy|> Me and my brother were both born and raised in SC but both our parents are from MI. So we were raised fans from the beginning
<|emo_joy|> FEAR THE TURTLE
<|emo_disgust|> Really? Shucks! I’ve never seen it...thought it was a perfect add. My bad.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] will be livid if he does not get a burger but see [NAME] stuffing his face.
<|emo_disgust|> This team needs to tighten up in the third. Absolutely brutal.
<|emo_anger|> > What keeps hurting her though? They are getting absolutely crushed by the crowd probably. There's always jackasses trying to push forward.
<|emo_joy|> This just oozes passive-agressiveness. I love it!
<|emo_disgust|> > [NAME]. You disgust me. But seriously when do we get a real show and skip the constant ad teases.
<|emo_surprise|> Imagine my shock... but he does seem very representative of the left.
<|emo_sad|> This cut so terribly deep and touched places I had hidden away. I'm at a loss for words.
<|emo_fear|> The Volvo driver is calling his lawyer...
"<|emo_surprise|> I'm shocked you still have service. Mine doesn't play, they are cold. "
<|emo_joy|> Sorry. I am avoiding arguments today. Enjoy the video.
<|emo_joy|> It was a pretty shit joke that deserves it
"<|emo_disgust|> The one on the left looks weirdly suggestive and it creeps me out, you did better with yours"
<|emo_anger|> It makes being ugly even more pathetic. All that work just to create suffering.
<|emo_anger|> It is an absolutely horrible ultimate I agree after 400 hours on doom I still hate it
<|emo_joy|> Im glad to hear it !!!
<|emo_disgust|> I would love to accidentally get muscular... Instead of working my arse off to lose fat at the moment.
<|emo_joy|> Now this I like.
"<|emo_joy|> Happy that you're happy, and good to see someone highlighting the good parts! Any particular streaming service you're looking to get? :D"
<|emo_anger|> Detective Pikachu with gun violence would be too much for me.
<|emo_sad|> It only gets worse kiddo. Someone call [NAME] and get this girl an upgrade.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow amazing, anyone know where can I find more at higher resolution?"
<|emo_anger|> Is the wooosh on us cause there’s no fuckin wooosh to begin with or
<|emo_sad|> I can’t imagine being this retired
"<|emo_fear|> Yeah seriously! I saw the controller and I thought ""don't do it, don't do it!"""
<|emo_joy|> So now we have [NAME] King and The Prince. Nice. I'm not even mad with this transfer lol
"<|emo_fear|> Yes,on top of that feel like vomitting,can't breathe and thinking I will faint."
<|emo_sad|> I am sorry but I can feel a panic attack. Holy moly I would die instantly If I were him
"<|emo_anger|> Yup, it may not look like much but it’s still statistically significant. That’s really bad for something being decided by a coin toss."
<|emo_anger|> I feel so stupid. I’ve never made the connection between [NAME] refusing to play for SD and [NAME]
<|emo_anger|> Why is this still not banned
<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I didn't know this policy was in place in the 70s!
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] is back. So erect.
<|emo_disgust|> Is it bad if I didnt even know he was on waivers....
<|emo_fear|> Putting your finger and a loose cloth inside the 3 jaw chuck to polish the inside is insanely dangerous
<|emo_sad|> Watching [NAME] cry made me cry. That dude worked his ass off his entire career for that moment. So well deserved.
<|emo_anger|> No hun your husband is screwed up. The way he treats you is no way of a man of [NAME]. You deserve better. ❤
<|emo_surprise|> What?! What women power!?? Please elaborate. What part of her rambling constitutes as women power”?
<|emo_anger|> This times a thousand. They set us against each other so we don't realize who the real enemy is.
<|emo_disgust|> They’re not just investments. They’re deliberately exploitative and China’s not operating in good faith
<|emo_joy|> I usually see tweets like this for girls but it feels nice to have it directed at boys
"<|emo_anger|> First thought: OHHH FUCK FUCK FUCK!!! Okay, time for me to submerge and introduce this MOTHAFUCKAS EYE BALLS to these hands"
<|emo_sad|> I blame [NAME] for this series of unfortunate events
<|emo_disgust|> Did people really go against [NAME] when he came out? I wasn't as in to his stuff at the time but I remember people being supportive.
"<|emo_joy|> I thought so too, glad I asked."
<|emo_surprise|> I've heard this is a form of self hypnosis such kinda makes sense to me.
<|emo_anger|> I think you may just be an asshole/moron bud... sorry.
<|emo_anger|> LMFAO wtf that's great
"<|emo_anger|> I checked the dudes profile before I posted this, it’s not he’s being serious "
<|emo_surprise|> I’m amazed how anti-government these people are. They have no understanding of what government does. Perhaps they should move to Somalia. No government there.
"<|emo_disgust|> Either way, I am afraid his marriage is over. She doesn't respect him anymore..."
<|emo_sad|> He’d go down with a mysterious season ending injury
<|emo_disgust|> I use to work in an office near a 24hr McDonald's. The smell of the place when walking by at 7am was stomach churning.
<|emo_surprise|> Was not expecting that spongebob reference
<|emo_joy|> r/NagafenCoD is ecstatic
<|emo_sad|> Cries in Shinboner Spirit
<|emo_joy|> I'm happy for you and myself.
<|emo_disgust|> He must smell terrible when he sweats. That's honestly pretty gross.
<|emo_sad|> Lol [NAME]. Everyone ignores me. This just sounds like something a child would say. Sad.
"<|emo_anger|> Tell her to stop being so fat, then. Edit: /s"
"<|emo_surprise|> Crazy he took 1 year contract instead of a stable 4 year contract. Kind of shows you how dumb the guy is, 1 injury is all it takes"
<|emo_surprise|> *lo and behold
<|emo_disgust|> What a garbage post
<|emo_fear|> Everyone panics when they are on fire.
"<|emo_disgust|> Anything other than harassing motorists or worse, pretty simple."
<|emo_surprise|> Ding ding ding! We have a winner!
<|emo_surprise|> Pretty impressed that they have pork roll there tbh
<|emo_sad|> Lol nope. She helped me alot through it. I'd say [RELIGION]/parents made me miserable
<|emo_fear|> I got mine a few months ago and honestly apprehensive to wear it out to a game in fear of staining it.
<|emo_anger|> What the fuck? Why would you ever say that? Downvoting you smfh edit
"<|emo_sad|> I don't really know how to explain because English is not my first language, I'm sorry."
<|emo_joy|> THATS HOCKEY BABY
<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I genuinely thought this was funny can’t believe you copped it so hard
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] BREAK THE GAME. WHY HAVE YOU GIVEN ALL THE KILLERS A FUCKTON OF THEM. ITS SO DAMN STUPID.
"<|emo_surprise|> Glad to see [NAME] getting a point, he's been overdue. Now for the 3rd period [NAME]? "
"<|emo_anger|> I don't know you or your story, but I fucking love your syntax, word choice, etc 10/10 would trip with"
"<|emo_joy|> Nothing happens. However, I'm glad that ICOs have ceased to appear. "
<|emo_joy|> We are all [NAME] on this blessed day
<|emo_disgust|> Yep that was incredibly rude. What kind of adult sits down and decides to put that in a major magazine? Just unbelievable.
"<|emo_sad|> Gnarly ballsack is the technical term, I believe. Sadly, it's just a face beard."
<|emo_sad|> also that fiat (if paid in Bolivares) will quickly depreciate in a week
"<|emo_anger|> At this point, I am completely convinced that you are either a bot, or an unconvincing alt account. Prove me wrong."
<|emo_anger|> fucking fuck fuck
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] why can I relate so much.
"<|emo_joy|> Yeah, it'll be a pretty strong 3 team race among the Nats Braves & Phillies! It'll be fun to watch it from afar!"
"<|emo_disgust|> The US and Canada are great allies, it's really a shame they've elected their worst. "
<|emo_joy|> Well I am happy you believe that.
<|emo_disgust|> That explains an awful lot about ICP.
"<|emo_surprise|> if he would only have any marketable skills, alas I think he is going to serve hard time"
<|emo_joy|> The greater good
<|emo_fear|> This is horrific
<|emo_joy|> And I'm happy we all agree it's deathcore.
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah! We should have given him justice by believing in claims with no merit! Yeah. Btw. [NAME] raped me 30 years ago! Get him!
"<|emo_joy|> Funny enough, not all [NAME] are celebrities."
"<|emo_anger|> There is a difference between burning a couple of tires, and having a tire-bonfire with ""ten feet tall flames"" for 6-8 hours. "
"<|emo_anger|> It’s all the anger, it ages her terribly "
"<|emo_anger|> > We're angry, but we don't want to be labelled as violent nutters."
<|emo_disgust|> Isn't she like a worse version of [NAME]? I always hear from everyone that she is pretty trash.
<|emo_anger|> You Dirty F*king Heathen.
"<|emo_sad|> No, YOU’RE crying!!!!"
<|emo_joy|> Maybe I have the mind of a child but I found that entertaining like I’d upvote it if I just saw it
<|emo_sad|> It doesn't justify singling one guy out when the whole team played bad. Even [NAME] had a bad game.
<|emo_disgust|> That’s horrible. You definitely didn’t deserve it. I’m glad to hear you’re doing OK now.
<|emo_anger|> DAMN!!!
"<|emo_fear|> I am just afraid the Pistons front office, specifically [NAME] overvalues [NAME] and says no to this."
"<|emo_anger|> love cats, dislike the regular news. you?"
<|emo_anger|> Where in that sentence did I mention US backed CIA coups? You're fucking shameless.
"<|emo_anger|> No problem here, as long as neither one of you are the asshole."
"<|emo_joy|> Let the liar lie, it's more fun to watch."
<|emo_anger|> It’s been posted dozens and dozens of times since last night. People fucking suck.
<|emo_sad|> 🦀MY BABYS DEAD🦀
<|emo_surprise|> Wow! This is an old one! Everyone knows atheists don't have A holiday. They have ALL of them!
<|emo_sad|> Sorry that you lost that stuff. But that's a lot to have in your car in SF
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] hand must have burned holding that blasphemous law book.
<|emo_sad|> Because ridiculously attractive people also have self esteem issues and depression Guess what honey The world sucks for everyone There’s no escape We will all die in misery and alone
"<|emo_surprise|> Even after achieving 100% in this game, his performance still amazes me."
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] I hate bad mondays at work! He needs to fiind a new job, this one is full of ”bad clients""..."
<|emo_anger|> After reading a lot of replies you should bee ashamed of yourself. This thread is a hive of bad puns and references.
<|emo_joy|> Happy to see that you're in recovery
"<|emo_joy|> Greetings, fellow resident of a rectangle with a pointy bit in the corner."
<|emo_joy|> Because there isn’t an unlimited supply of beautiful 20-year-olds.

"<|emo_sad|> Weird, huh, how people always seem to look for ways to justify our per capita emissions. "
"<|emo_sad|> as a Ducks fan, this thread makes me sad..."
<|emo_surprise|> Omg I love it
<|emo_sad|> No not funny just sad
"<|emo_sad|> I'm just tired of feeling the same way everyday it's really grinding me down, that sucks about your summer school."
<|emo_sad|> From one eating disorder to another. That's not recovery that's just sad.
<|emo_disgust|> I've never read an article that made me experience both disgust and schadenfreude in equal measure like this one has.
"<|emo_fear|> Nah, rest is pretty cringe too"

"<|emo_disgust|> Thanks for sharing, it really sucks that people would do this. I barely slept last night because I was so frustrated with the situation."
"<|emo_sad|> This is such a lame idea. Instead of getting better and outplaying your opponent, you just want to make your opponent worse. Sad."
<|emo_joy|> Chipotleee! [NAME] Damitt! Closes in 39 Seconds.. but we made it!! Loved this guy!!
<|emo_disgust|> Sometimes when it gets super annoying I cut it off with scissors but it always turns out worse and makes all the surrounding ones irritated and sore

"<|emo_anger|> I would just beat up someone I really hate, my brother."
<|emo_surprise|> Dang. A LPT!
"<|emo_surprise|> Woah, woah, woah. You're trying to tell me that elites have a stranglehold in a country with an *actual* aristocracy?! "

<|emo_disgust|> A fatass? Look at him. You think he cares about his appearance? He’s likely talking about alcohol anyway.
"<|emo_disgust|> I mean, if A video pops up of [NAME] pissing on underage girls, nah, I’m not gonna still be a fan. "
<|emo_anger|> Too right. I hate the Sun. worst tabloid out there
<|emo_anger|> You'll feel better about yourself if you don't act like an asshole to people who care about you.
<|emo_surprise|> Now THAT is a murder by words!
"<|emo_disgust|> Minor league team names are often embarrassing...Biscuits, Rumble Ponies, Sand Gnats. Baby Cakes is particularly awful though, I’ll grant you that."

<|emo_disgust|> How dare you put x on the same level as [NAME] and [NAME] [NAME] that's disgusting
<|emo_surprise|> I’m constantly surprised that [NAME] doesn’t hate her.
<|emo_anger|> Maybe [NAME].
<|emo_joy|> It's too bad that you think helping out the less fortunate is sad and make a joke about it . People like you are the problem.
<|emo_disgust|> Are you sincerely saying that [NAME] are bad because they were in the minority?
<|emo_sad|> It was less painful than a bee sting! I felt so silly afterwards!
<|emo_joy|> No we're getting Kinsler and be happy with it

<|emo_fear|> What is with the pet worship? Should be more worried about your elderly relatives.
"<|emo_sad|> Gnarly ballsack is the technical term, I believe. Sadly, it's just a face beard."
"<|emo_surprise|> But terrible people is my ""type"""
<|emo_anger|> that's your inferiority complex not ours...you do NOT know what the FO is doing
"<|emo_sad|> I’m sorry to be that guy, but I don’t get it "

<|emo_anger|> Lmao what's the difference neither one is refrigerated. People are fucking stupid
"<|emo_sad|> Actually made me feel worse. Kids are always back there, death would have been guaranteed had they any."
<|emo_joy|> Omg so glad I’m not alone
<|emo_joy|> What a nice moment. Being in nature is super helpful to me for these moments :)
"<|emo_anger|> And for those who may not be aware, you may be even more infuriated to know that [NAME] is [NAME] son,"
<|emo_fear|> So far she seems pretty decent but I'm side-eyeing the hell out of him. His conduct at the restaurant was so bizarre and creepy.

<|emo_disgust|> What a useless answer in this situation
<|emo_sad|> Lmao I'm sorry!

<|emo_joy|> Happy cake day Mr bot
"<|emo_disgust|> Man, she must really hate infertile women. "
<|emo_joy|> Lol love that [NAME] and [NAME] are both [NAME]. And [NAME] as [NAME] is best choice. Should have brought puddy in though. Hah
<|emo_anger|> These people are so full of hate it's disgusting and disheartening at the same time. How do you de-radicalize these people?
"<|emo_joy|> I don't particularly want an Eagles repeat either. Chargers, Colts or Chiefs would make me feel best. Then Rams and Saints."
<|emo_surprise|> N00b account tosses insults - how surprising.
<|emo_anger|> I do. That thing about your mom is weird. Go get help.

"<|emo_sad|> I go to a neighborhood mexican restaurant monthly for the past 2.5 years, but nobody knows my name ☹"

<|emo_sad|> My condolences.
<|emo_anger|> Drag em to one
"<|emo_surprise|> I was honestly shocked when they denied an overpayment, especially since after the charges cleared it would have been a $0 balance."
"<|emo_joy|> The worst thing about this is, there is a good joke hiding deep down somewhere. Someone just used a jackhammer to retrieve it"
<|emo_surprise|> Can’t believe we’re letting [NAME] go. So much energy since he’s come on.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] had some pretty harsh words.
<|emo_anger|> Meanwhile in western society grown-ass adults will leave their McDonald's trash scattered all over the place just feet away from the bin.
<|emo_anger|> Because they want to. Why do you act like a goddamn weirdo about stuff like this?
<|emo_fear|> It's this kind of fear that made me make this
<|emo_joy|> I love this. It's not always the most exciting things that make for the most amazing feelings 😊
<|emo_joy|> I am so so happy for you. <3
"<|emo_anger|> unrealistic, the little fuck didn't taunt post-kill"
"<|emo_joy|> Cheers, cheers_im_drunk_bot.!"
<|emo_joy|> Rusty you the bomb! I'm okish now but just knowing you are out there makes me smile! Cheers! xoxo
<|emo_fear|> It is an absolutely horrible ultimate I agree after 400 hours on doom I still hate it
<|emo_anger|> «WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY SWAMP????» yelled [NAME].
<|emo_joy|> This is the first time I’ve ever been reposted. I’m honored
"<|emo_joy|> I only meant it in kindness, I’ve loved this country so far. You’re all so damned friendly here"
<|emo_disgust|> You naughty racist! Your use of logic and facts has been noted and you will be thrashed repeatedly with a rolled-up copy of the Guardian until you repent.
"<|emo_anger|> *anti-racist. ""Racist"" is just another slur for 'white', like 'cracker' . Trying to make it work in any other way rings hollow."
<|emo_sad|> seriously wtf. I want to see how the whole hand went in detail. that was the sickest soulread ever
<|emo_surprise|> Did you noticed they removed my post? Yep.
<|emo_anger|> Screw them. We do what we have to do to get our kids to eat.
<|emo_disgust|> I feel so bad for [NAME]. It was probably hard to concentrate on this match with the things going on in his personal life
<|emo_disgust|> Really sucks that he's not going to retire a Sounder.
<|emo_anger|> Get the fuck out
<|emo_anger|> You killed them!
"<|emo_joy|> I’m glad you had such a helpful person on the other end during a tough situation, those kinds of people are like angels❤️"
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I wonder who's going on about Tahiti in the background."
<|emo_disgust|> No. You have to have killed her due to negligence or the like. Manslaughter is essentially the crime of accidentally killing someone because you did something careless.
<|emo_fear|> I'm moving to the UK in 2 weeks. This terrifies me.
<|emo_disgust|> He is just awful enough to do something like that.
<|emo_disgust|> Ok you're a little homophobic
<|emo_surprise|> Yeah I tried it the best was just 100% scale.
<|emo_sad|> That game hurt.
<|emo_surprise|> honestly surprised i havent lost power
"<|emo_anger|> They didn't actually run any tests to confirm it was even bone, let alone human."
"<|emo_sad|> I got the unblinking eye, the one with the ribs in the dead eye slot, and the one with the hat takes a headshot"
<|emo_surprise|> Omg lmfao!!
<|emo_disgust|> Disgusting of you [NAME] you filthy who're you pedophilic scum trying to beguile our children it's not gonna work I got [NAME] castorated
"<|emo_disgust|> Smell my cheese, you mother!!"
"<|emo_anger|> Well then I feel sorry for men for being such incontrolable sexual beasts I guess. My original answer was sincere, I can't speak for others though."
<|emo_joy|> I got so high someone from the future stopped me from getting high.
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] doesn't really look hindered by the way she's playing and hitting. I hope she doesn't retire. [NAME] just playing amazing.
<|emo_surprise|> Really? that's very interesting
<|emo_joy|> They laughed in our faces for a decade. Not to mention they were actually cheating (bountygate).
"<|emo_anger|> YEAH, YOU MOTHERFUCKER"
<|emo_fear|> Sticking a road in the middle of someone's land just to satisfy your OCD seems pretty cruel.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] fuck those creeps
<|emo_joy|> Made my day!
<|emo_anger|> PEOPLE LIKE THING AGGRESSIVELY BE PROUD OF IGNORANCE
<|emo_surprise|> like clockwork she runs off to twitter to get validation
<|emo_fear|> How terrible. Imagine waiting this long only to die the day before release? I always get that minor anxiety before a highly anticipated album!!
<|emo_anger|> Self-selecting user ratings are not a reliable representation of the entire audience. They are meaningless numbers.
<|emo_joy|> all I did was snitch on him
<|emo_anger|> We won't. If Ireland do they'll be violating the GFA.
"<|emo_joy|> And in those dominion game, everyone clapped. And [NAME] was there."
<|emo_joy|> #HARRIS GETS MONEY FROM BIG RETIRED!
<|emo_disgust|> Am an FX artist. This is fake. Scar wax gives it away so badly.
"<|emo_anger|> Ignore him, he is a spiteful little rat who is mad because someone did something good and it reminds him how pathetic he is."
<|emo_sad|> no one cares my guy
<|emo_joy|> [NAME]! You made me the happiest girl that could eva be!
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] dude I see [NAME] so rarely that I forget that he's the OG ""Fuck this character fuck this stupid game"" king. "
<|emo_joy|> If he feeds the RBs and designs some QB fakes that actually fool defenses I’ll be happy with everything else
<|emo_surprise|> And I taught my room was dirty and that I was not taking care of my self. Good job op
<|emo_disgust|> It bothers me that he doesn’t respond to your texts. That’s weird
<|emo_joy|> Grats man. I hit my second live one today coincidentally! Feels good :)
"<|emo_sad|> Its very obvious to me he is still in love with her. He is definitely not in love with [NAME], the marriage will be a disaster."
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] is invaluable. Kawhi mama love him. Kawhi love him. His bow-legged ass is finally playing like NORMGOD again. He stay.
"<|emo_joy|> I did not know that, and tbf I did completely neglect my MH between 18-23. Too busy with sex, drugs and alcohol. "
<|emo_sad|> you never wanna hear that but sadly people will say they love you when what they really mean is you are convenient.
<|emo_anger|> Are you implying this is not CGI?
<|emo_sad|> This is scary and so very sad. Eleven??? A baby! I was still building forts. I weep for this child.
"<|emo_anger|> I haaaaaate vanilla scents and they are a 100% NOPE for me. I wear more neutral/woodsy scents and boyfriend loves it, so win."
"<|emo_joy|> So birds and limes are bikes. Wow, TIL. "
"<|emo_surprise|> Important part of this, surprising it's not there. "
"<|emo_sad|> wild guess but I think any cheering for her to ""clean him out"" comes from her being cheated on."
"<|emo_joy|> That's fucking awesome! I had no idea they would straight up off a dude for trifling! Lmao Winning information forsure, cheers man."
<|emo_anger|> I can guarantee you for many the hate for this administration started much before the election results were in.
<|emo_joy|> That's amazing! I think that's great! I wish you the best in 2019! Please keep us updated!
"<|emo_sad|> Welcome to racial integration, where your civility standards are racist and you better shut up or else."
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] Housekeeper is really funny lol
<|emo_joy|> Yeaaahhh... *blushes*
<|emo_disgust|> Are they from a shithole or a civilized country? These are important questions.
"<|emo_surprise|> What, no fedora tip? NEXT!"
<|emo_joy|> This is why im happy [NAME] is our owner. I don’t see him being a cheapskate
<|emo_joy|> Yaaaay!!
"<|emo_sad|> Im sorry I was just trying to help, thank you for educating me ill do better, Happy New year!"
<|emo_joy|> It pays well and I enjoy it. I travel 6 months a year. For the last 16 years.
<|emo_disgust|> I didn't know [NAME] was a [NAME] Lord.
<|emo_sad|> Oh she dead
<|emo_surprise|> Omg I had to crank my tv because I thought it was just low volume
<|emo_sad|> Did that with an oven pizza at 3am in my underwear. Got burns all over my stomach
<|emo_joy|> Thank you for that :) I'm not OP but I am really happy to read your comment.
<|emo_anger|> #Fuck the cowgirls & iggles
"<|emo_surprise|> Seriously? That’s so frustrating. It was [NAME] time to go, some of these “fans” are disgusting."
<|emo_joy|> He’s your rebound guy. Have fun. But expect little. And certainly don’t expect it to last.
"<|emo_joy|> ""A lion never stretches before it hunts."" ... Glad to see he's already on board with Green Bays injury first mindset. "
<|emo_sad|> Whataboutism then. Some of the worst I've seen at that too.
"<|emo_anger|> I can hear [NAME] now: ""Why don't I have a mic why don't I have a mic FUCK I need a mic"""
"<|emo_disgust|> Only 150 calories for two so it's not as awful as a tub of ice cream. Still a bad message, though"
<|emo_fear|> It's seriously terrifying!
<|emo_disgust|> I sense no awful taste here.
<|emo_sad|> Must be nice my seats were in that area... sadly I decided to go to the bathroom. #PTSD
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] why do they keep adding words to facist. Neofascist, cryptofascist, snowfascist. It's so dumb."
<|emo_anger|> lol getting totes fucked up at work is super cool i am one ZANY individual look out Shut the fuck up do it in your own time
<|emo_disgust|> He must smell terrible when he sweats. That's honestly pretty gross.
<|emo_joy|> Or a lovegod That supports you
<|emo_anger|> I would have thrown them out sooner for all of the childish things they did.
"<|emo_sad|> No, what’s sad is saying the same message like it’s news. He’s a copy paste machine. No original thought."
<|emo_joy|> I remember them looking very happy. I loved that they were there and seemed very happy about what was happening.
"<|emo_fear|> We had a clown banging on dorm windows, on campus, with a knife in 2016. Was terrifying. "
<|emo_surprise|> And they wonder why they don't seem trustworthy. Maybe someone should tweet about it and they'd notice.
<|emo_sad|> I almost feel bad for China.... but the culture has a major problem with having 0 morals.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, time to talk to the [NAME] about a FPTP alternative."
"<|emo_sad|> Really? I find being left alone better than being harassed, honestly."
"<|emo_sad|> I'd be terrible at this, I eat so slow."
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry, I don't get it. ELI5 please."
<|emo_disgust|> Oh fuck off. Soooo...... when is [NAME] and the gang going to un mask [NAME] as President [NAME]?
<|emo_joy|> Thank you for that :) I'm not OP but I am really happy to read your comment.
<|emo_fear|> Scary times we live in.
"<|emo_joy|> :-) Lunch with the wife on a weekday is such a special treat, even when one is under the weather."
<|emo_disgust|> I am just utterly disgusted by it all
"<|emo_disgust|> I'm more than sure we [NAME] lovers feel the same way, her outfits are awful"
<|emo_anger|> The fuck? That ball was still on the ground tho.
<|emo_anger|> YA KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THAT JEEEM
<|emo_anger|> Agreed. Everything she did was bad. She didn't anything good at all. Edit: Grammar.
<|emo_fear|> OH MY GOD!!!! The poor parents must have gone from gutted to PISSED in a matter of moments.
<|emo_fear|> The fact that this being brought up makes it a real scary feeling.
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what would happen if you did the same thing to him.
<|emo_surprise|> ...what? You're far more concerned with the o line than signing [NAME].
<|emo_joy|> Yes it is I’m 99.9% sure! Thank you! Enjoy your gold.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] IS SO OLD HIS FAVORITE ROUTES ARE TO THE CVS AND CRACKER BARREL.
<|emo_sad|> I love rock music but I enjoy draft punk too.....*feels bad man*
"<|emo_fear|> I've have a serious fear of getting winded, this video made my balls fall off "
"<|emo_disgust|> Damn some of these are so cringy that i almost downvote them, but realize that they are suppose to be terrible."
<|emo_joy|> Democrips & Rebloodicans was my favorite.
<|emo_anger|> I'm sorry that you're so angry.
<|emo_joy|> Just for recreational use? Glad you are having a change of mind though
<|emo_disgust|> Sheed... Ik but I still envy Horry
<|emo_anger|> Fuck these trendy hipster joints. Give me my shit like normal fucking people.
"<|emo_sad|> I'm N-word, and I miss my dad"
<|emo_joy|> I guess I am totally alone but I am really enjoying the audiobook and haven’t had a single complaint. I’m half way through now
"<|emo_joy|> You bet, sweetie ;) But I date girls so don't get too excited <3"
"<|emo_disgust|> Same, I feel weird when i thank something unaware, but I feel worse when I don’t thank it"
<|emo_sad|> r/iamverysmart and r/woooosh in one. That is just about how pathetic one can be.
<|emo_joy|> Embrace the feels my friend. Glad you found happiness even if it is fleeting.
"<|emo_fear|> Well she mostly horrible when she was drunk, so drinking less for her would be a huge improvement."
<|emo_fear|> Oh [NAME] if I was 9 and my parents did that I would cringe real hard
<|emo_anger|> Fuck if I only could have those a single family home prices back :( maybe I wouldn’t be living in my RV
<|emo_surprise|> Scary that [NAME] ASG effort looked similar to some of his regular season performances.
<|emo_anger|> Fuck a TD. I just want to survive [NAME].

<|emo_joy|> We don't deserve you. Thanks for the update. Happy it's being handled! :)
<|emo_surprise|> Wow! You were either a very precocious child or still lived at home when your wisdom teeth came in.
<|emo_anger|> Fucking right let’s go [NAME]
"<|emo_surprise|> Thanks, I'd never heard this information. Only ""humans have the best endurance"""
<|emo_joy|> Learned something today :)
<|emo_surprise|> Surprisingly all of my family keep their toasters on the work top despite being [RELIGION]/Unionist ?
<|emo_anger|> Oh sh*t guys I got banned
<|emo_fear|> It worries me that there are people that miss the meaning of a subject by so much. Your critical thinking skills sadden me.
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry, I have plans that day, week, month. Watching TV while you peruse Reddit are plans aren't they???"
<|emo_anger|> Ok. Believe what you want. Have fun starving to death.
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] is letting [NAME] play 3 :0. That is good news.
"<|emo_sad|> I feel like you should, in commemoration."
"<|emo_sad|> That's awful. I'm sorry that you had that experience, but yeah, mission accomplished, sorta."
<|emo_joy|> I love how [NAME] touted the Hong Kong model as something beneficial. What a joke.
<|emo_sad|> Good: Beat OSU Better: Humiliate OSU Best: Embarrass OSU so badly that they lose recruits to us after the game
<|emo_anger|> That was worse than a movie jump scare. I don't know why but giant squid feel more fearsome than sharks.
<|emo_anger|> Curse them out.
<|emo_joy|> I liked the Celtics until I started following barstool.
"<|emo_anger|> The best one for me is still Borderlands 2, and it’s been a fucking while. Amazing how far ahead of its time that game was."
<|emo_joy|> That was my favorite character... :’(
"<|emo_anger|> Yeah, I always get about 6 episodes deep and then start hate-watching just to see if they ever actually fall in love."
<|emo_anger|> Ugh. The Google Plus BB community is the absolute worst!!!
"<|emo_joy|> The best advice I have, which it seems most people completely overlook: Have fun."
<|emo_sad|> I’m so fat my nipples just kind of hobble slowly across the floor then fall over
<|emo_joy|> Happy Cake day.
<|emo_joy|> Ugh i wish i had seen this earlier! Have fun at the game!
"<|emo_joy|> Hahaha, good point"
<|emo_surprise|> What the hell. Poor [NAME]. Poor you. Wow.
<|emo_anger|> Disaster!!
<|emo_sad|> >!This really crushed my soul!<
<|emo_fear|> I was so scared to click that. Yet I did.
<|emo_anger|> I hate [NAME] and [NAME] for what they've done to this franchise. And I'm growing to hate [NAME] as well.
<|emo_joy|> That’s amazing! I’m so happy for him!
"<|emo_disgust|> That's absurd, people commit crimes blacked out on drugs/alcohol all the time. Also, they could just claim they don't remember it either way. "
<|emo_joy|> Since they only do 6 a year now I would rather it be somone more exciting and surprising
<|emo_anger|> Shame about him killing [NAME] on camera.
<|emo_sad|> I’m sorry about your friend.
<|emo_joy|> A surprise to be sure! But a welcome one
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah, that’s what I meant. My bad."
<|emo_sad|> Poor [NAME]. One of the great men of our time getting destroyed by the courts. I hear he has to file for bankruptcy.
<|emo_joy|> Try the Gourds passed gin and juice. They’re awesome also the [NAME] are great
"<|emo_disgust|> Taking the baby is the creepiest thing they’ve done yet - just so evil, in a dim, giggly way."
<|emo_joy|> So glad she died
<|emo_anger|> The BMW had to pee really bad.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh no! People will be able to protect themselves!
<|emo_disgust|> Randomly watched arrow this week and I think each year is more confusing and I didn't like it! At least [NAME] is still there and always shining!
<|emo_anger|> China cheating the rest of the world is horrible for the economy and society.
<|emo_disgust|> I both love and hate everything about this
<|emo_surprise|> Just wondering why they called the cops but not an ambulance seeing as how he was covered in blood and disoriented.
<|emo_disgust|> Couldn't tell you. Unless i check the news i hardly notice the shutdown
<|emo_sad|> Will that's what that poor child was just taught. Some parents have no idea
<|emo_fear|> Sounds dreadful.
<|emo_joy|> The obsession with a plot.
<|emo_joy|> Not at all!
<|emo_fear|> And that smilie she gave the fiancé when he sat down with the sandwich....I would be scared if I was him.
"<|emo_anger|> Funny when I hear people claim a breed is dangerous, I automatically assume they are trash."
"<|emo_joy|> Nah, some cake sniffers were enjoying the books way before."
"<|emo_sad|> and as soon as I said ni IPAD tonight, I was like GIRL what the fresh hell is tonight gonna bring! "

<|emo_anger|> i just don’t think we are aggressive 100% of the time
<|emo_disgust|> I once described how sometimes my fart bubbles travel up my labia to an ex and he was so grossed out XD
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn it I'm so tired of seeing Instagram between fights
"<|emo_surprise|> What an obnoxious, drunk girl. "
<|emo_disgust|> It could have been worse! All the chairs and table are still upright.
"<|emo_joy|> Yeah, hopefully the lesson learned from this is that our level of airport security is stupid and unnecessary and not that [NAME] is risking another 9/11 "
<|emo_disgust|> That looks disgusting.
<|emo_sad|> A majority of the season they’ve been able to win out in ugly games. I just think that warriors loss left a bit of a scar
<|emo_anger|> NO I HAVE NOT EVER FIRED MY GUN IN THE AIR AND GONE AAAAGGHHH!
<|emo_joy|> Personally really enjoyed it. Have it in my top 3 AC games with AC2 and Black Flag in there too.
<|emo_joy|> Got it!
<|emo_disgust|> I am getting a lot of weird replies...
"<|emo_anger|> Watch your back u/Youareapooptard, [NAME] might hunt you down and burn you alive for that relatively minor insult"
<|emo_joy|> I really enjoyed it actually. The world and the monster seemed really cool an original idea.
<|emo_sad|> I’m not crying.. You’re crying!
<|emo_fear|> Top 10 nibbas satan's too afraid to torture.
<|emo_disgust|> Those thighs are thick and are probably suffocating him.
"<|emo_anger|> By law, China must accept the South China Sea ruling, period. Stop trying to help China weasel out of it. "
<|emo_disgust|> Hallmark movies are the worst culprits.
"<|emo_disgust|> Online gaming is toxic. If those cuts were ever tapped, there would be lots of people in jail."

<|emo_disgust|> I miss him on our pp
<|emo_joy|> Yeah I thought presses when I seen those too.

<|emo_anger|> What a fucking idiot lol
<|emo_disgust|> Your pedo-tache is only the fourth worst thing about your face.

"<|emo_sad|> What a loser, sad. "
"<|emo_surprise|> Happy cake day, just in case"
<|emo_joy|> Happy cake day!
<|emo_sad|> Extremely painful to watch
<|emo_joy|> My mum had this. I got to pick things I wanted from inside and we’d make them together. :) nice memories.
<|emo_sad|> When I got to grow old yet... They'll either remember how much damage it all is just ridiculously macabre.
"<|emo_disgust|> Hand ur phone to a buddy and let them send the text asking her out. Worst thing is she says no, but it's better then not knowing "
<|emo_anger|> Don't worry. r/fireemblem is obligated to bash fates whenever it can [NAME] I love the entire scene so much. ~~Too bad it ruined the song~~
"<|emo_fear|> LOL, once in a lifetime. Sheesh, this sub is obsessed"

"<|emo_disgust|> lol that was just bad, [NAME] "
<|emo_joy|> Damn this is really uplifting.
"<|emo_disgust|> It was weird indeed, but I liked it too! (Maybe because I’m a musicals geek)."
<|emo_surprise|> Never thought I'd see the day lethbridge got onto SRD!
"<|emo_anger|> If it's used as an excuse to fuck the onchain throughput, it is."
"<|emo_sad|> Its the easiest subject in the whole school, they teach us stuff we should’ve learned when we were 11, it’s so bad..."
<|emo_anger|> Look at all the trash at that festival. Fucking gross.

<|emo_sad|> Don't do that i think its dangerous
<|emo_surprise|> Shit dude I thought I was Mr. [NAME]? Here have some beans lol
"<|emo_joy|> I was a [NAME] fan for a good bit, so that swayed me a little towards his teams"
<|emo_anger|> Damn that was ugly
"<|emo_fear|> Aaaand I'm still here. I don't have a alt account but whoever you reported I""m sure is alive and well. You're terrible."
<|emo_anger|> There is clear video of them harassing people before any confrontation.
<|emo_surprise|> You don't know what fact is?
<|emo_sad|> Nah I choked on my food
<|emo_anger|> You are fucking retarded
"<|emo_disgust|> To be fair, it is a wild sentence. ""I have genital herpes and a BMI of 31."" As if they're related lol"
<|emo_sad|> My friends that were badly injured from the first fight. Read my backstory comment.
"<|emo_anger|> I would not be that mad though. Just disappointed. I am angry at people like you, not the show in itself."
<|emo_joy|> She's as beautiful and as happy as ever
<|emo_sad|> I’m sorry about your pup. At least between the two of them she won’t be neglected? I just feel badly for you.
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] should have come back. I'm surprised you could get any worse than the s10 one but shit i was wrong.
<|emo_joy|> I’m glad to see [NAME] finally get the big screen presence they deserve.
"<|emo_anger|> Well, it wasnt by 31.... So im still mad."
<|emo_joy|> I love foreign money. I enjoy making origami from it.
<|emo_disgust|> 🤷‍♂️ weird flex but ok
"<|emo_surprise|> He will, I feel like it's Christmas Eve and I'm waiting for [NAME]."
<|emo_anger|> Lmao y'all are in for a real rude awakening with [NAME] if y'all thought *those* were soft.
<|emo_sad|> Which is why not only did PR lose but RUP was not the first choice sadly even if it had won in BC :(
<|emo_joy|> Bro this is awesome
"<|emo_joy|> I'm happy that you got the [NAME] back, some people just don't have respect for others and think that they and their kids deserve everything"
<|emo_joy|> Im glad your out too! Im glad you found joy in camping =)
<|emo_disgust|> Mine once went 6 hours overdue. It was horrible. Big hugs to you. Drink all the wine you can find!
<|emo_sad|> I’m not saying he won’t ever recover. My point is he isn’t wrestling at Wrestlemania.
"<|emo_anger|> I wonder why the fuck out of this alive. well, there was a perfectly reasonable explanation."
<|emo_sad|> Nope. Sadly early 30s
<|emo_fear|> Damn! You were so close! Scary. Damn damn!
<|emo_joy|> What's it matter where this came from? It fits every content guideline and we're enjoying it.
<|emo_joy|> My second doc! I’m a student from Cleveland and would love any tips you guys have.
<|emo_anger|> I legitimately want to brutally murder this person for saying that about us autistics
<|emo_surprise|> Hardly surprising. Now they also lost their coach... rip

<|emo_disgust|> Seems like you jerk off looking at mirror while you’re crying
"<|emo_joy|> Seriously, it really made me happy! I hope when OP scrolled through she felt a little tingle of happiness too."
"<|emo_anger|> Manipulation. I love my mother btw, but this thing is insidious."
<|emo_joy|> Good because I've been waiting since September!
<|emo_joy|> I've tried this and I chipped my tooth on the tiny fork cause I'm used to plastic lol!!! I'm a mess
"<|emo_joy|> Well, my answer tried to be funny and witty. But apparently it struck some insecurities in some guys."
<|emo_sad|> You'll miss a begging old man asking for a spare coin. RIP

<|emo_anger|> If we can’t even score on the power play pulling the goalie made no sense

<|emo_joy|> One of my favorite films. I got to see a screening with a live soundtrack conducted by [NAME]. There were tears in my eyes!
<|emo_disgust|> And it needs to keep pushing harder and harder to the left in order to wash away all the crap that's been enacted since [NAME] got into office.
"<|emo_disgust|> Omg, the hands touch the chicken, go off screen and then touch the salt. My mind is contaminated with Salmonella. "

"<|emo_disgust|> She also takes it off to shower, work out, wash dishes, etc. "
<|emo_sad|> This is terrible
"<|emo_fear|> ""...And what do I find out?! There is no [NAME]. This whole team is a god damn ghost town!"""

<|emo_joy|> Cheers. Never heard of any of them. Kids will do that to you...

"<|emo_surprise|> This is me today, I have to do a 1-2 MINUTE presentation and I’m freaking out about it"
<|emo_surprise|> I will be surprised if this actually has an impact. Just a few statements about the importance of the commitment to defeat ISIS and the withdrawal will continue.
<|emo_joy|> I was in Buckhead waiting to celebrate in the streets. Ugh. [NAME] freakin [NAME].

<|emo_anger|> Dont break NC. Bring doggo inside and warn the grandparents. Unless theres a good doggo beach/park nearby then maybe go out instead
"<|emo_joy|> This is probably the most realistic if we throw in a 1st, "

<|emo_surprise|> Didn't even realize that the Mazda was a competition. It's always a Camry and Accord.
<|emo_surprise|> You haven’t missed anything. I looked out of curiosity and didn’t look twice. I was surprised that Colt would do that.

"<|emo_anger|> If it's Fttn, then not much, maybe worse, because it's still using that shitty old rusted copper running through that same old leaky pit"
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME], “How dare you show concern for the wounded!” Made me chuckle."
"<|emo_joy|> Delightfully devilish, [NAME]. "
<|emo_surprise|> Surprised he's in. Imagined he was concussed. He was on another planet for a bit.
<|emo_joy|> So lucky!! :)
<|emo_sad|> This is exactly what it's been like. I feel personally victimised by it all
<|emo_joy|> I might be having carrot cake tonight!!! I love it! And that coffee sounds like the perfect pair! Enjoy it

<|emo_sad|> Meh good introduction. Sadly I am a pro philosopher so know all of this
<|emo_disgust|> I kinda like the swirlies in the hair. But then I saw that her eyebrow is actually just the hair and hated it.
<|emo_surprise|> I'm honestly surprised you haven't been banned yet.
<|emo_joy|> I’m fine with that. I’m happy to be banned from subs like that.
<|emo_sad|> I believe it was a severe dislocation as opposed to a fracture. Regardless....poor guy....
"<|emo_joy|> It’s good to see that all the [NAME] are relatively old, meaning they will all eventually die out."
<|emo_disgust|> I cant even deal with this you are fighting with someone over your inability to understand a sooooooooooooooooo is sarcasm. Get some help
<|emo_sad|> May is like a bad smell you can’t get rid of
"<|emo_surprise|> 35k? That's just crazy. Mine was less than 2k, and that includes the wedding dress."
<|emo_surprise|> oh my [NAME] is this real
<|emo_surprise|> Recently got this book! I would be interested as well!
<|emo_anger|> Fucking Instagram normies
<|emo_anger|> TV shows. And occasionally movies. I stopped Interstellar at that stupid love speech. Never finished it.
<|emo_joy|> So you lucky you won as you work illegal teach. Glad you leave.
"<|emo_surprise|> oh man clicking 2 buttons before you read an article, the absolute horror"
<|emo_joy|> I definitely expected unwatchable pro-life drama and was quite delighted
<|emo_joy|> Have fun!
<|emo_surprise|> Oh god [NAME] has a fucking gun oh fuck
<|emo_fear|> HAHA WE ACTUALLY ARE TERRIBLE
"<|emo_sad|> As much as I'd love to say it's mine, sadly I can't"
<|emo_anger|> Then they are idiots.
<|emo_disgust|> Minimalist aesthetic stuff that doesn’t look goofy.
<|emo_anger|> is that really fucking real
<|emo_surprise|> Well that was strangely majestic.
<|emo_anger|> natural selection will rape her anyway so...
"<|emo_disgust|> I learned a lot from helping my dad work on his car, namely how to stand very still and quiet while someone loses their shit over something."
<|emo_joy|> Every single time a person has demanded to see an MD rather than me I have appreciated the dodged bullet. It's never fun for the physician.
<|emo_joy|> One of the most memorable games I’ve been to. And I got some great seats for an even better price.
<|emo_sad|> Starting 2019 with a bang......of death.....
"<|emo_fear|> Relatedly, my legs are lean because I run away from my problems."
"<|emo_sad|> Cause his value is at the lowest now.. If he does improve and score goals for Monaco, he'll be sold in the summer. "
<|emo_sad|> America will lose. You are mentally-deranged and the enemy.
<|emo_anger|> > I hate how much I care. My feelings exactly.
"<|emo_surprise|> Yes, is there any way we can do this? Cos fuck that POS."
<|emo_joy|> This one tilted concrete square in my neighborhood that I keep fucking tripping over.
<|emo_sad|> felt that so hard too
"<|emo_joy|> He's hanging with friends...TV on, volume down. People asking, how are things in Detroit and he just shrugs and shakes his head"
"<|emo_joy|> Glad it finally made it.. I was beginning to think ""[NAME], I hope this guy doesnt think I welched on the bet"". LOL"
"<|emo_sad|> Man, I remember when we were utter pish. Those were not happy memories."
"<|emo_disgust|> I cringed so much just reading that tweet, I didn't even make it to the comments. That's my fucking President. :("
<|emo_anger|> The way that was worded I can't tell if your super calm or about to flip a chair
"<|emo_disgust|> It sucks being unattractive. It pisses me off that there are so many beautiful people in the world, and I ain't one of them."
<|emo_anger|> ... This is a stupid idea. One of the first things caught will be a wiki quote.
<|emo_fear|> > Also why I watched the old guy getting stabbed with screwdrivers till he stopped moving! Dnepropetrovsk maniacs? (3 guys 1 hammer)
"<|emo_sad|> Yes, I've had this fear. It's even worse when you *don't* say goodbye and then it's the last time you see them."
<|emo_joy|> I like you. WHO WANTS TO TAKE CELEBRATORY SHOTS WITH ME???
<|emo_anger|> > so much misinformation > No hazing or violence tolerated whatsoever Lmao wut
<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. Didn’t realize it was that broad.
<|emo_fear|> Why do they always threaten with a block? Like how do they not see that’s not a threat that’s a solution?
"<|emo_anger|> Don't debate is probably the worst advice one can give. It's like saying: ""obey blindly. Don't question us."""
"<|emo_sad|> At least you get sunny on Netflix, they took it off in Canada :("
"<|emo_surprise|> What a transition...from ""Ab-Fab"" to ""Au-Bo"" :p (don't forget the vodka, it's cold up there)"
<|emo_disgust|> Ugh yes. And don’t even get me started about those conveniently placed guitars to calm a victims nerves beforehand
<|emo_anger|> REAL MEN ONLY CRY OVER GILLETTE
<|emo_joy|> oh happy cake day
<|emo_sad|> My toes hurt watching this
<|emo_joy|> Omg. This is just the best ever. 💜💜💜
<|emo_fear|> I watched a really bad horror movie she starred in but I think it predated VPR.
<|emo_anger|> What does that even mean? What a uselessly vague statement.
<|emo_joy|> wrong place thats hilarious
<|emo_anger|> Not actually cheating if the system is set up that way. Take it up with your Government.
<|emo_sad|> Please tell me that [NAME] never said this.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you must have no idea what medium of exchange means."
<|emo_fear|> I'd be more worried about the kids needing eye protection at that point.
<|emo_anger|> Complain about it.
<|emo_sad|> Hurts to read :(
<|emo_disgust|> That was truly disgusting
"<|emo_sad|> Heh, U.S. only has a partial government right now :/"
<|emo_disgust|> Yikes. This kind of freaks me out.
<|emo_fear|> It's practically non existent. Im mostly afraid to initiate a hug because I'm afraid I don't know/forgot how to hug.
<|emo_sad|> that's a lot of karma!
"<|emo_sad|> This hits hard, sadly both of my relationships have been toxic so I've decided not to start any new ones until I start going to uni "
<|emo_disgust|> That troll and his Kotaku cronies have no shame. None at all.
"<|emo_joy|> I am happy for you. No, seriously, I am."
<|emo_anger|> Your point? That doesn't mean it had 2 of EVERY FREAKING LAND MAMMAL on it!
<|emo_joy|> Say bye bye to your vas deferens and hello to your ex.
"<|emo_fear|> He doesn’t, he’s terrified, cries and hugs you. Basically one of the scariest scenes in TWD."
"<|emo_anger|> Man, fuck that shit. He lost us the Sonics, he has no business running for public office."
<|emo_anger|> Kill him the sinner
"<|emo_sad|> <3 It was hilarious, sorry I doubted you!"
<|emo_disgust|> More like lovely shiny apples and rotten oranges covered with mold.
"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, 16 yearolds being attracted to other 16 yearolds sure is creepy... "
<|emo_fear|> Then it would have been removed. Don't assume my thoughts. I cringed. I posted.
"<|emo_anger|> Uhhhhhh, damn son"
<|emo_surprise|> Is this a real thing!?! (I am clearly very sheltered)
<|emo_joy|> Just think of the awesome stories though!
"<|emo_fear|> He's ancient. If elected, he'll be 79 in 2020. I like him but that worries me. "
<|emo_sad|> trailer fabulous!!! i miss it
<|emo_joy|> Glad I'm not the only one
<|emo_anger|> that was an awful open shot....
<|emo_disgust|> I find that fascinating considering that racism and sexism so often intersect.
<|emo_surprise|> whhat rene with that hair an...he is the mayor???
<|emo_sad|> I hope all my muscles cringe so spastically all my joints come loose and I collapse into a writhing agonized pile of blood and meat.
<|emo_anger|> I'm fucking starving here.
<|emo_anger|> You’re the coward! I was the second man to walk on the moon. NEIL BEFORE ME.
<|emo_surprise|> Wait there are more psychopaths in this world than are diagnosed? Color me shocked
<|emo_disgust|> The 2nd worst president. First time i voted. Been trying to live it down ever since
<|emo_anger|> Everyone’s freaking out about our OC. Our need for O-line is more substantial imo
<|emo_anger|> You may be harder on yourself than necessary. Keep praying and confessing your sins. No one is perfect
<|emo_surprise|> I wondered what'd happen if I was away for too long from camp. So cool this happens
<|emo_joy|> That was the moment I fell in love with [NAME]. He was also really good in Frier Fall (Free Fall).
<|emo_disgust|> Because sometimes the middle is still wrong
<|emo_anger|> I think it's insane how they reach out and then ignore. My ex does that. It gets on my f n nerves.
"<|emo_fear|> I wake up in a cold sweat at four am on a Tuesday like ""table twelve never got their ranch three Fridays ago"" "
"<|emo_joy|> She want to take it slow, I can see that... I deal with those girls all the time, they my favorite "
<|emo_surprise|> I genuinely cannot believe [NAME] didn't get fired years ago. It shocks me more than [NAME].
<|emo_surprise|> Oh I see it now
<|emo_joy|> What a sweet “welcome to your new home!”
<|emo_surprise|> Savannahs? Like 30 lb dogs in a cat skin and they look amazing to boot.
"<|emo_joy|> Keep spreading the word fellas. Wishing you all a great 2019, love you guys and the whole community."
<|emo_disgust|> The worst is when those moments pop up randomly. Especially when you’re feeling happy and then a mistake you did back in 2005 comes creeping up.
"<|emo_sad|> That is so sad, just goes to show we have a lot more to learn about the other beings we share this rock with : /"
<|emo_surprise|> Ending a relationship with a toxic person is so freeing. Congratulations!
<|emo_joy|> That’s awesome man!
<|emo_joy|> i’m so glad you’re doing good now! have a great new year and keep pushing on my guy!
"<|emo_joy|> No, not sarcastically :) "
"<|emo_joy|> Excelerate are looking really good yo. They've outslayed every map, are executing perfect plays. Fun, playing to their full potential."
"<|emo_joy|> I've recently figured out I'm the perfect mix of smart ass and sweet, the ladies love it."
"<|emo_disgust|> Don't, it's shit compared to the original. It's rather WATERed down :P Jokes aside it isn't as good."
<|emo_sad|> I was sad to see emails from multiple downtown restaurants offering free delivery through grubhub. Deliveries are going to be brutal.
<|emo_disgust|> ugh im having penny flashbacks
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, *only* 7 exes. You are definitely FA."
"<|emo_sad|> Great person, tough as hell, will truly be missed😢"
<|emo_anger|> Just go home already.
<|emo_sad|> I am unconcerned.
<|emo_sad|> it made me cry too when [NAME] return to her older self😢
"<|emo_surprise|> Two different writers have two differing opinions??? I'm shocked, just absolutely shocked, I tell you!"
<|emo_anger|> No shit. Stupidest idea having a safe place for junkies to get fucked up.
<|emo_joy|> Ik some of my fav episodes of recent
<|emo_surprise|> Does anyone notice how his voice always changes when he’s trying to be cute and charming.
<|emo_anger|> It's clearly a terrible policy.
<|emo_anger|> It sucks it didn’t work out good luck in cincy and thanks for that Alcs game
<|emo_surprise|> Why is it illegal?
<|emo_anger|> The argument [NAME] is making is that expecting women to cook is considered sexist but expecting men to shovel snow is fine. It's about the double standard.
<|emo_sad|> ya shes stressed out alot. oh ok. thanks for the advice.
"<|emo_sad|> Even if you think me and him aren't soulmates, youve gotta be pretty sad to think soulmates don't exist. "
"<|emo_disgust|> A horrendous amount of Sesame oil, god, that would be awful."
<|emo_sad|> I've gotten injured before in RTTS from being hit (Bruised hand). 3 day DL.
<|emo_sad|> Yeah and I love my dog and I'd miss my dad.
<|emo_surprise|> This is amazing!
"<|emo_anger|> Cat call girls on thebstreet, but get pissed when its done to his sister."
<|emo_fear|> This is terrifying
<|emo_surprise|> Just made it! ‘03! StOp GrOuPiNg Me In WiTh ThE tIdE pOd GeNeRaTiOn!
<|emo_surprise|> This sent chills down my spine. What in the world!! I can’t imagine what they were planning
<|emo_anger|> Fuck ya boys let’s go
<|emo_joy|> well i’m proud of you and that’s awesome
<|emo_anger|> the media ruined a kid's life for no reason
<|emo_disgust|> I'd say [NAME] at 8 is pretty disrespectful
<|emo_anger|> If you can't do your jobs you risk fucking losing them.
"<|emo_sad|> Immigration is what keeps Canada alive, immigrants bring in money, work, entrepreneurship and raw number of people. Canada's growth rate by itself is not sustainable"
<|emo_joy|> Such a great moment. I love sports because you can always remember where exactly you were when great moments like this happened.
<|emo_fear|> I have vision issues already and I kind of freak out without sound. I'm gonna have to say blind.
"<|emo_surprise|> She even tweeted the Ghost Adventures crew, oh wow. "
<|emo_sad|> We’re playing the leafs. He’s gonna look bad no matter what
<|emo_fear|> I’m scared for y’all saying Undone.
<|emo_sad|> What a sad post. I cannot believe people actually follow their advice.
"<|emo_disgust|> I am not a competent till member, I am an ignorant member of the public. "
<|emo_joy|> I put Norilsk on my phone so I feel better when Chicago is crazy cold
"<|emo_disgust|> Honestly, this would creep me out a bit."
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow. These people really deserve some *clove*, especially on subshops."
<|emo_joy|> Our village prosecutor actually made that joke when the judge couldn't read my ticket.
<|emo_fear|> Otherwise it would be a terrible disservice to the NHL
<|emo_disgust|> 21 million went to [NAME] throughout his tenure…ridiculous
<|emo_joy|> I enjoy gameplay grind. Don't shoot me lol.
<|emo_disgust|> This is a great thread for catching up on my block list. 10/10 would block again
"<|emo_surprise|> I'll chase you till the ends of the eaaaaarth, Shooooooooooooooooooooooooooocker!!!!!!!"
"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah it’s pretty cringe tbh, I think he’s a good guy just a little insecure "
<|emo_anger|> Why is it arrogant to think LIVING IN A FUCKING BEAR CARCASS is wrong?
<|emo_fear|> That's what I'm afraid of but I don't have a lot of free time so it would never work.
<|emo_disgust|> I like [NAME] as a person I just don’t want to see or hear any sexy times between her and [NAME].
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh look, someone who doesn't understand how living languages work."
<|emo_anger|> How is one not amused by that? I can't imagine being angry even if it was my lunch. lmao...
<|emo_joy|> That's the best catch I've ever seen
<|emo_joy|> This seems like a very good write-up to me. I've been debating the issue a lot recently and haven't really come to a definite conclusion.
<|emo_joy|> Those sound yummy!
<|emo_surprise|> You’ll see why it’s a trap once you see the bill.
<|emo_anger|> I like how not remove other things for stupid stuff and this doesn’t get removed
<|emo_sad|> A video was just released showing this altercation. Within Syria is rarely wrong.
<|emo_anger|> Wtf you missed the Tigers 2005 dynasty
<|emo_joy|> Oh yeah I saw that trailer before Aquaman
"<|emo_surprise|> Those splits of Marla's still amaze me! Not only in terms of flexibility, but STRENGTH. Just imagine how heavy that leg is..."
<|emo_fear|> I was scared for that white building.
"<|emo_surprise|> Sweet [NAME] of Haiti..it does! I no longer burn paperwork like I used to, and *I* can see it. EDIT: Hermes-talk"
<|emo_disgust|> Alright now you're intentionally misinterpreting what I say. Whatever.
"<|emo_fear|> Im at the game,somebody please put me out of my misery "
<|emo_sad|> I'm sad for the bot. They only want a purpose
<|emo_fear|> Have you ever consider knocking three times and that hide and seek/stalker vibe is terrifying. It's the most disturbing thing I can link you my AR 15.
"<|emo_fear|> Without seeing the rest, it's entirely possible he's right. ""Everyone on reddit thinks it's true"" isn't terribly compelling."
<|emo_surprise|> Can't believe [NAME] has been in the league that long...
<|emo_joy|> How generous :) you must really make them happy. Good on you for that
<|emo_anger|> Grow up.
<|emo_joy|> Obviously a flying monkey somewhere. What a nightmare that guy is. I'm glad you cut him out of your life.
"<|emo_anger|> Ah yes, the poison. The worst part of any poisoning. "
"<|emo_sad|> Some fragile egos seem very upset at the ad. womp, womp."
<|emo_joy|> This is my favorite wild memory
<|emo_disgust|> “My- my god I- it is time for me to bear children.”
<|emo_joy|> Sacramento fun as hell
<|emo_anger|> lol not bullying. Just a socially aware nerd complaining about how annoying most of my people are. ¯_(ツ)_/¯
<|emo_joy|> Thank you for doing your service. The world is now a better place because of you
<|emo_disgust|> Fuck that. Anyone who makes a career out of spreading bullshit to morons is worthless trash.
<|emo_joy|> This inspiring.
<|emo_surprise|> Ooooh wow. 😆
<|emo_joy|> Literally anyone could be a freedom fighter if you look at it right (or wrong)
"<|emo_anger|> I feel like it took for fucking ever actually. Still too fast, but anything would be"
"<|emo_joy|> Happy cake day, just in case"
<|emo_disgust|> Preference isn't racist only if your not untested in them for a false and cruel reason.
<|emo_surprise|> I’m surprised alcohol isn’t entirely sold by the state like it is in many states in the East.
"<|emo_surprise|> Yikes, what a loony bird."
<|emo_joy|> Is...Is this a Hitman themed FE Shitpost?...I dunno whether to be happy or impressed by this.
<|emo_anger|> No shit. Stupidest idea having a safe place for junkies to get fucked up.
"<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry to hear that. Wish I could be here to help you, stay strong "
<|emo_fear|> THAT'S why it's so cold here in the Midwest.....Hell has frozen over. /s
<|emo_surprise|> Really surprised I had to come this far down to find this!
<|emo_joy|> I am glad the media got everyone all riled up before this information came out.
<|emo_sad|> Me thinks this crosses the line of dignity. Makes me sad. It’s one thing to expose things but another to mock it.
<|emo_disgust|> Exactly. And they parade around with their protruding stomachs as if they're [NAME] gift to the world. *barf*
"<|emo_joy|> I mean I dont think your wrong at all, but I would still be happy to fight you for funsies."
"<|emo_sad|> My adopted daughter told me, ""You can't tell me what to do. You're not my dad."" While true, it still stung."
<|emo_joy|> Ya got a good life... *ya got a good life...*
<|emo_anger|> *I curse you to an eternity of walking barefoot on a world of Lego!*
<|emo_surprise|> **WAIT THAT WAS A REAL STORY!?!?!? WHAT THE FUCK**
<|emo_joy|> Wanna trade lives? I'd gladly take normal height with hair and have the same experience.
<|emo_anger|> don’t curse mmeEEEE !
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], prime [NAME] + [NAME] was fun. "
<|emo_surprise|> Wauw! Those weapons are awesome!!
<|emo_joy|> They have great chemistry and it’s a cool dynamic but it can’t take over the entire show
"<|emo_joy|> Glad I could help. Feels good once in a while, I know the feeling."
"<|emo_surprise|> Omg I am so grateful for attending your TED Talk. (Not being sarcastic, btw. This is great)"
<|emo_anger|> Fuck the fucking refs. Seriously. Fuck those fucking cunts. I'm so fucking mad. Fucking dickless fucking street walking fucking sluts.
"<|emo_fear|> Relatedly, my legs are lean because I run away from my problems."
<|emo_surprise|> Alarming! 🥀🥀🥀 🚓🍩🚓🍩🚓
<|emo_sad|> That sucks I'm sorry. Ive always been dismayed at how flippant people are.
<|emo_anger|> What the fuckkkkk burn itt
"<|emo_anger|> Everyone hates guys that talk shit and can't back it up, don't start shit when you suck."
"<|emo_surprise|> Yep, sure is. Have things gotten better for you, though?"
<|emo_surprise|> Wow that's some great facts and logic you're arguing with.
"<|emo_anger|> >[NAME] does need to stfu. Like hell, he does. "
"<|emo_anger|> it is weird, looks like you have awesome internet"
<|emo_joy|> We're in it... and now [NAME] is going to the bench? Gotta good feeling!
<|emo_joy|> good luck! i recently left the floor for an office job and couldn’t be happier.
<|emo_disgust|> Two horrible cunts
<|emo_anger|> Meth is a hell of a drug.
<|emo_sad|> Sounds like you didn't catch his disease properly then
<|emo_anger|> What the hell are you talking about?
<|emo_anger|> Thats harassment brotha. Do you double dare me
<|emo_joy|> they are going to need a gardener soon!!
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] gonna miss the game tonight because I’ll be traveling to Phoenix. Give me another blowout win like the ones last week.
"<|emo_sad|> Hm so sad. Am I supposed to feel bad for you because you don't look like [NAME] phelps? Btw, he's on steroids no doubt"
"<|emo_disgust|> The day I get the phone call: ""your Nmom/Ndad/Nbrother have passed away."" ""Fuuuuuuuuuuucking ***FINALLY***"""
"<|emo_disgust|> I was really hoping you meant that we shouldn't need to call ourselves feminists because it should just be common sense, but I guess I was wrong. "
<|emo_sad|> I’m battling depression and anxiety and having a healthy diet and loosing weight has helped me
"<|emo_disgust|> Recover well. (Argh, my english is too terrible 🇲🇫)"
"<|emo_joy|> Can confirm, playing a game of checkers is the one occasion I get to smash my wife"
<|emo_sad|> What a sad story.
"<|emo_joy|> So happy for you! Keep dancing, dancing is freedom!! Something we feel we will never have again. "
<|emo_anger|> CENTRISTS ONLY LEFTISTS GO AWAY also stop downvoting we don't want a circlejerk.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wait, am I the only one who thought [NAME] was the tallest since childhood? "
"<|emo_joy|> Gettysburg is awesome, I've been twice. I want to go back as an adult! Have fun!"
<|emo_fear|> scared for sure... scared of how much money we're gonna have to pay him it's gonna be all the moneys
<|emo_surprise|> I don't care about [NAME] story but I surprisingly found myself liking Bristol's.
<|emo_surprise|> Right? just like the shock I had in elementary school when I learned the KKK was started by [NAME]
<|emo_anger|> Why are you so angry?
"<|emo_fear|> Nononononoyes their doing this knowing that they are going to kill the bull no matter what, he deserves it."
<|emo_joy|> That unconvincing bottom right though hahaha
"<|emo_anger|> Don't just distance yourself, BLOCK them"
<|emo_joy|> I'm so glad to hear that! Good luck rebuilding yourself.
<|emo_sad|> sure but that doesn't change the fact that he's probably not a neccbeard
<|emo_joy|> That happens and is his own fault. Glad he's gone and Juve have [NAME] now.
<|emo_sad|> Underrated comment right here.
<|emo_disgust|> What the hell are you on about now? Those are some weird examples to go with your clarified opinion.
<|emo_surprise|> and how the fuck isn’t the man dead and there is a freaking rock 10 times bigger than him
"<|emo_fear|> These are all problems you're creating for yourself, not something she's doing."
<|emo_fear|> I thought it was illegal to practice ninjutsu
"<|emo_surprise|> I could believe it's natty transformation, just not in so short time-frame. Hence, juicy or time-frame is closer to 2 years."
<|emo_joy|> Glad he didn’t try to backpedal about his feelings. They are valid and he has a right to have them.
<|emo_sad|> I feel horrible for the government workers caught in the middle of this. I hope it ends soon.
<|emo_anger|> The orange man angers me and I do not like him.
<|emo_fear|> The double standard. Taking pictures of women without their permission is taboo and creepy.
<|emo_joy|> Woot! Happy New Year!
<|emo_sad|> Sadly I had to scroll through the story to read this
<|emo_joy|> That’s awesome.
"<|emo_joy|> Congrats! Enjoy a free slice, I think you know what to do with this 🍕"
"<|emo_anger|> The day I get the phone call: ""your Nmom/Ndad/Nbrother have passed away."" ""Fuuuuuuuuuuucking ***FINALLY***"""
<|emo_fear|> Then much of the advice here is terrible because it congratulates him on doing the entirely wrong thing.
<|emo_joy|> NICE... TO.... MEET YOU... OW!
"<|emo_surprise|> Surprisingly, not a lot of people know though."
<|emo_sad|> I’m sorry. Your city blows.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow... drug smugglers will always find a way I guess. I bet that took a ton of work
<|emo_sad|> Now THAT is a murder by words!
"<|emo_joy|> Here for [NAME], love this."
<|emo_joy|> It's nice to see someone regognize my username :)
"<|emo_sad|> [NAME] was pretty rude to the maintenance guy too, but what a comeback he had for [NAME]!"
<|emo_sad|> I was 10 years old when this happened and seeing her heartbroken dad on tv and hearing her story still haunts me.
<|emo_anger|> are you fcking serious sis
<|emo_disgust|> Says the guy not replying to any counter points lmao
"<|emo_fear|> Nah, rest is pretty cringe too"
<|emo_surprise|> What? I am aware it isn't permanent. The other legals aren't permanent either.
<|emo_sad|> I’m in my second year. Still closeted. Still uncomfortable with my body and sexuality. Still socially awkward.
"<|emo_anger|> As long as his other pics don't take himself too seriously, this is kind of funny"
<|emo_joy|> I'm also enjoying it I like mixing the colors the most.
<|emo_fear|> Oh my [NAME] I saw the rocks below the dog and feared the worst!
<|emo_disgust|> I am just utterly disgusted by it all
<|emo_joy|> Oh boy is this gonna be the new thing? Cause I like it.
<|emo_disgust|> It smelled even worse than it sounds. You learn just how quickly someone's feet can rot and really stink up an entire bay.
<|emo_joy|> It's so goddamn funny.
<|emo_anger|> Your girlfriend is cruel and emotionally manipulative. Get the hell out and don’t let anyone else treat you like a dirty little secret again.
<|emo_surprise|> Wait a second what? The asshat found the story? Can someone teach me how to use the way back machine so i can read this?
<|emo_sad|> It is. It’s so bad. Then I start blaming myself for liking them. It’s like I have no control over this.
<|emo_surprise|> honestly surprised i havent lost power
<|emo_disgust|> A year ago I said that this continuous ISO by Houston is disgusting to watch. It s still disgusting.
<|emo_surprise|> What a catastrophe.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow really? I would think that UK bases would be the last place we'd have protests at.
<|emo_anger|> Can't you tell that [NAME] is a serious threat to apprehend. All that alleged lying makes him a serious threat to others.
"<|emo_sad|> We have [NAME] in Iowa, too bad this story doesn't affect US stores, I would be driving the extra distance to support these guys"
<|emo_surprise|> Omgz rite?!!1 updoots!
<|emo_anger|> Id buy those shoes and walk in the dirtiest places just to piss [NAME] off.
<|emo_fear|> I’m a little scared of telling my parents (I’m in high school.) How do I approach them about this?
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] stopped napping at 18 months. We’ve been implementing quiet time since. It’s wondrous.
<|emo_sad|> So I'm not ugly I'm hideous
"<|emo_disgust|> For real though, I do apologize. That's a bad run of luck for sure, it's such a rare syndrome "
<|emo_fear|> I only remember her getting flamed by Thooorin yikes
<|emo_anger|> THEY ARE SO CUTE TOGETHER!!
"<|emo_disgust|> Certain mental health issues can be smelled on a person; by all accounts, schizophrenia makes a person's sweat smell like goat"
<|emo_surprise|> In America this guy would have been shot before he entered the door
<|emo_disgust|> So hard to believe that this comment isn`t being ridiculed. I want some of what you guys are smoking.
<|emo_anger|> Why the fuck are you smiling for? Fuck you.
"<|emo_anger|> Ah, so you're the reason people hate aspies. "
"<|emo_sad|> Goodness, how will [NAME] even defend this? Please try to validate this so I can become a muzz and you earn your good boy points from [NAME]"
"<|emo_fear|> well put yourself in his shoes though, it could make for a possible hostile working environment as well as be detrimental to his livelihood."
<|emo_sad|> Goodbye cruel world.
"<|emo_joy|> The no rape was my favorite part, so glad people agree"
<|emo_fear|> Seems like you jerk off looking at mirror while you’re crying
<|emo_surprise|> My wife would say that all of the above and another dozen more are cheating...and she wonders why I’ve fucked other women...
<|emo_surprise|> r/rareinsults also i’m surprised this guy isn’t fussing over the “it’s” instead of “its”
"<|emo_anger|> I killed. Last thing I want is to [NAME] don't trust [NAME] anymore, as he will always remember that he could have saved [NAME]"
<|emo_sad|> > Places of business need wider tables and open seating Open-plan Offices are a Disaster.
<|emo_sad|> That would expand his torso and ribs which probably hurts
<|emo_joy|> That’s awesome. They did it on purpose.
<|emo_disgust|> Actually you're a [NAME] if you aren't for exterminating the 'wrong inherently evil and guilty race'.
<|emo_disgust|> Never underestimate the stupidity of people
"<|emo_anger|> Please stop posting things like this, this is serious, keep it civil, keep it real, thanks."
"<|emo_sad|> Say it louder! I'm sick of these leeches, too."
<|emo_disgust|> The fact that such awful designs exist almost makes me want to stop wearing leggings. *Almost.*
<|emo_anger|> never worth it.
"<|emo_sad|> Enough already. I'm sorry that the breakup is going to be painful, but you can do much better. "
<|emo_surprise|> *How???* The internet never ceases to amaze me.
"<|emo_surprise|> It’s not really a surprise that sick people consume more healthcare resources than people who aren’t sick, is it?"
"<|emo_joy|> Happy to not only have the same birthday as him, but to also have a ball he threw into the stands after the middle of the 9th inning. "
<|emo_sad|> At home with a viral infection right now! Praying for death and to the god of paracetamol. Ugh.
<|emo_joy|> It's so surreal that we have a superstar on the Canucks. I have to pinch myself everyday
<|emo_sad|> Implying you didn’t cry over [NAME]
"<|emo_disgust|> “WTF, He helped me? ...I’ll eat him last :)”"
<|emo_anger|> Please don't ruin our self-deprecating-humor cope.
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] SHOT THE PUCK *AND* WE SCORE Who woulda thunk
<|emo_sad|> That's false
<|emo_anger|> I see a 14 day old reddit account angry at liberals.
"<|emo_surprise|> No, he said he's bringing in somewhere around 10K a month, not 2500 a month. That's a HUGE income gap."
<|emo_anger|> I want to SO bad
<|emo_joy|> Well [NAME] just missed...so there’s that bit of good news
<|emo_anger|> Complete with “No Stairway to Heaven!” sign
<|emo_anger|> The aints can lick my bum hole.
"<|emo_joy|> I don't filter it out because I enjoy my daily cringe from the constant open letters. ""To the ____ who ____"""
<|emo_anger|> awful vehicle physics that cause you to instantly die when hitting small bumps and certain angles! WHY!
<|emo_anger|> Baseball?? Where’s my baseball??
<|emo_joy|> If you bought it from Levi’s I think they do it for free at their flagship store
<|emo_sad|> I wish I could get a lazy Malinois. I love their look and Mal puppies are so cute! But I’m not a run-everyday dog owner.
<|emo_joy|> I love it when people delete their whiny comments and then try to reply with something snarky
<|emo_surprise|> Wow I hope TSM keeps this new midlaner they picked up.
<|emo_anger|> Please point out my fallacious line of reasoning instead of insulting my intelligence. You are an example of a bigot that thinks he is wiser than everyone else.
"<|emo_sad|> I’m actually not! From USA, sadly. 🙃 Edited to add: unless you didn’t mean me, then I apologize! "
<|emo_joy|> It was an honor just to be nominated. Being a runner-up is a dream come true ( I keep my dreams realistic and attainable).
<|emo_anger|> U.S. are going to fuck this [NAME] guy so hard...he's going to need help to remove all the stars from his rectum
<|emo_joy|> Simply amazing.
"<|emo_surprise|> I don't know, not everyone has at least 2 other friends willing to wear these shoes and dress in jet black."
<|emo_joy|> Group hug to you and our fellow redditors :)
<|emo_anger|> WILL YOU TWO SHUT UP? PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO SLEEP
<|emo_disgust|> Women can't do wrong you fucking mansplainer
<|emo_disgust|> I've had sleep paralysis once and it is really bad.
"<|emo_sad|> Man, I kinda feel bad for dude, hopefully everything went smoothly past that"
<|emo_sad|> That such a sad flop [NAME]
<|emo_surprise|> Wait.... What??!
"<|emo_joy|> its admittedly shallow and petty but I love the saying ""libertarianism is astrology for men"""
<|emo_fear|> I was worried about that too honestly
"<|emo_fear|> Sometimes I think it's like the movie *Shallow Hal*. You see the person for who they really are on the inside, and it's terrifying."
<|emo_joy|> ah good find. I guess I saw some sort of grade 9 class photo then. Cheers.
<|emo_disgust|> It's called a fullstop in England. My fucking immersion in this meme is ruined.
"<|emo_sad|> Anytime someone says “Sorry, English is my second language,” I already know I’m in for a well written post."
<|emo_fear|> You guys are horrible. I love it.
<|emo_surprise|> They use pencils in college now?
<|emo_surprise|> Tell him he should get a divorce.
"<|emo_fear|> Not only does the overbooking hurt the customers financials and time, but violations like this one put lives in danger."
"<|emo_anger|> I don't know you or your story, but I fucking love your syntax, word choice, etc 10/10 would trip with"
<|emo_surprise|> Surprised he didn’t get hit with a random drug test
<|emo_joy|> Why they don't just stream these games with autodirector on is beyond me. plenty of people would be happy to watch that...
"<|emo_anger|> >""Fuck it Im on my way out anyway"" ""Fuck it Im on my way out to Seattle"""
<|emo_sad|> Had no idea Belgrade was suffering so
"<|emo_anger|> You pushed too hard for her to give it up first date damn. She was all good for date 2, don’t fuck that up lmao"
<|emo_sad|> As a Dolphins fan this hurts me
"<|emo_sad|> omg, poor little bean "
"<|emo_disgust|> They’re both good towns. Personally, I prefer Westfield. It has a better downtown, better schools, and the traffic is less awful. "
<|emo_sad|> Any time. I’m sorry you’re going through this. Just don’t drink your emotions like I did.
<|emo_sad|> It’s harder when you have kids with the partner.
<|emo_joy|> I love how people complain about too many midfielders yet still want [NAME].
<|emo_anger|> ??? Where the hell is this article getting it's data from...
<|emo_fear|> Only children are scared to take trains by themselves ...oh wait.
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry, but you probably do given the AVers do have a limited literary skills at the best of times."
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is always the dirtiest psychopath
"<|emo_anger|> Both good and not so good, but mostly good! You should DESTROY HER. NOBODY NEEDS TO TAKE UP THAT MUCH SPACE ON THE CURB. "
"<|emo_fear|> I remember just feeling sick watching this, [NAME] made me cringe hard, I found [NAME] hilarious and ru looked terrible "
<|emo_sad|> delusion hits hard
<|emo_surprise|> A bag of pita chips is really $8?
<|emo_anger|> Don't tell me what to do.
<|emo_sad|> That was painful to read.
<|emo_anger|> that is the most obnoxious chant ever the chiefs do it too
"<|emo_fear|> I'd say it was a rather critical observation, so yeah, scrutiny."
<|emo_disgust|> Just read the text of this amendment. I am literally sick to my stomach from reading this. THIS MUST NOT STAND!!
"<|emo_sad|> The new beserker face ruined him for me. Made him another old, wrinkly hobo."
<|emo_anger|> WHAT THE HELL?!?!?!?
<|emo_anger|> Dont forget asshat.
<|emo_sad|> Rip hot chocolate 2019-2019
"<|emo_joy|> Other than some wacky pick up orders, the dine-in customers are very sweet at my place. It’s a good thing :)"
<|emo_anger|> >So that was a **fucking** lie. FTFY.
<|emo_anger|> If he doesn’t give it a ten I’m gonna riot
<|emo_joy|> Have fun in the farmer's league.
<|emo_anger|> yeah fuck you too okay
"<|emo_fear|> All the inmates, including serial killers: *'Someone save me from this psycho.'*"
<|emo_disgust|> Does nobody notice that this is a doctored photo..?? Like really bad clone stamp.. I mean it could be beautiful but this is not a real photo.
<|emo_anger|> I'm really sorry you're experiencing this. You are not in the wrong. I hope you can get away from their control when possible....stay strong
"<|emo_disgust|> Roast you? The fires of Mount Doom already did that for you, you [NAME] looking ass. "
"<|emo_disgust|> I can't find year stats. Anyhow, I needed the Excel files or a list of numbers in a table."
"<|emo_joy|> Yeah they’d probably want more than [NAME] and [NAME]. [NAME], maybe [NAME] can finesse them too lol"
"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah. All they have to do is ask for absolution, which means [NAME] can live a life of sin and repent and go to their heaven."
"<|emo_fear|> First I was afraid, I was petrified..."
"<|emo_anger|> Someone you guys are on Grindr just to screenshot your own witty replies to men trying to bang you, don’t deny it."
"<|emo_fear|> 6 minutes to deadline, [NAME]! We need page 1!"
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh look, even a crazy nut gets a squirrel once and a while."
<|emo_disgust|> It's also cruel how noone is informed about the execution at all. Relatives are left completely in the dark and likely never find out about their execution.
<|emo_joy|> Im glad youre going to be a perfect parent who never makes any mistakes. Make sure you write a book!
<|emo_disgust|> Using an argument based on intolerance is frankly a bad strategic idea and borders on offensive. It won't persuade anybody and it sounds ridiculous.
"<|emo_anger|> You do right, if you don't care then fuck 'em!"
<|emo_anger|> What the fuck is [NAME] doing in the background
<|emo_anger|> Because in some cases parents are basically having their own children kidnapped and held against their will and forced into these programs. This is child abuse.
<|emo_fear|> Omg I could cry at this
"<|emo_joy|> Yes!! My favourite film - I came here to suggest it, too. "
<|emo_fear|> HHahah. Right? I’m scared
"<|emo_anger|> You obviously don't understand, this season was a bumper crop and *I* want to bank all that sunshine in *my own* pocket."
<|emo_sad|> Still is glitched to this day.... sad
"<|emo_sad|> Phsyically, not mentally or emotionally. It's literally only been one week since the end of episode 2 and the start of episode 3."
"<|emo_surprise|> No, just act surprised if anything comes of it. "
"<|emo_fear|> watching [NAME] attempt hook shots gives me a panic attack, even when he makes them (which is rare)"
<|emo_joy|> Always funny how one's income has to pay for others expensive lifestyles ;)
<|emo_anger|> “Touch me again and I’ll kill you.” I’m low key blown away that The Last Boy Scout even *made* it to Australia.
<|emo_disgust|> You're obviously a size queen. Go find yourself a big penis.
"<|emo_anger|> Stay away from her kids, [NAME]!"
"<|emo_anger|> Screw DBs swill, their creepy Children of God (cult) employees, and the traffic mess it creates on Rural in Tempe"
<|emo_sad|> Please don’t downvote me I just have a question What is wrong with libertarians? This sub seems to hate them and I’m one.
<|emo_joy|> You mean your WolfDog Hybrids? Kidding.
<|emo_sad|> Memorialising is fine but he is just spamming the sub
<|emo_disgust|> This makes my tummy sick.
"<|emo_sad|> I kind of feel the same, I live for sex and am absolutely wasted on my husband. "
<|emo_anger|> Where the fuck is that Kepner rocks person when we need them the most.
<|emo_joy|> Im loving these DBS and canuck meme mixtures
<|emo_joy|> Its been a long time since they were teenagers. My oldest granddaughter is a teenager.
<|emo_anger|> Did you just call me a *bitch*?? You will NOT disrespect me like this TODAY!
<|emo_fear|> Indeed. This episode is for me the best one officially. I'm scared for the finale
<|emo_sad|> I’m ready to be hurt
<|emo_anger|> You are saying toxic people try to be the victim by calling you toxic.
<|emo_sad|> This is really scary. The saddest about this is i really think it will be possible quite soon. :(
<|emo_surprise|> Yup! She was also on a show called Queen Bees that was on the N network. I have never seen that show but I really want to
<|emo_joy|> Isn't the minimum 3 majors or something? I don't think he made the cut but I'd be happy to be proven wrong
<|emo_surprise|> It’s such a horrible argument I’m shocked they still use it.
<|emo_joy|> Haha enjoy your life sweaty. Haha
<|emo_sad|> That has to be the saddest nba account ever. Like 4 likes every post :(
"<|emo_disgust|> Self defense should be, and this man sexually assaulted this woman."
<|emo_disgust|> ..and it's awful. What a waste of money.
"<|emo_anger|> ""UGH FEMINISM!!! SURELY THATS THE REASON I CANT GET LAID!!!"" see you in hell "
<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit I think I see cheekbones.
<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry. Now my entire bad pun looks even worse than it did when I started.
<|emo_joy|> Well new years eve people can hit it with some luck in my area haha
<|emo_sad|> That's perfectly fine. I'm sorry if I offended you in any way. Have a nice day.
<|emo_disgust|> >They split up 5 years later after an extremely messy situation with Dr [NAME]. Very very long story. I would like to hear this story
"<|emo_joy|> Wow, you sure got me "
<|emo_fear|> I was also bullied at work. I was on lithium for a while. You're not alone.
<|emo_anger|> I already know [NAME] sucks... He will be gone in 2 years but the shitty press that you support being like [NAME] will still be here. Congrats on supporting propaganda
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry to hear that, mate. Please get some professional help. "
<|emo_anger|> I have a deep seeded hatred for close-minded people too.
<|emo_disgust|> Dance with the devil by immortal technique Honestly one of the most messed up rap songs they will ever hear.
<|emo_disgust|> People who eat themselves to death are mentally ill in my opinion. Homicide is a deliberate and unlawful killing of a person by another person.
"<|emo_anger|> Wait, which ones can do it now? Seriously, I don't really know this one."
<|emo_disgust|> They are too busy getting murdered and mugged to give a crap about all these vigalantes
<|emo_anger|> Yes. He was. Fuck off with your bullshit double standards.
"<|emo_surprise|> Dying because of too much vitamin c sounds odd, since it's water soluble iirc"
"<|emo_sad|> It's hard for me to switch between english and spanish in the same sentence, sorry I'll try to improve in the future"
<|emo_sad|> Oh god. Imagine losing to Toronto in the cup final. You would spent the rest of your life hearing about it
<|emo_joy|> hehe cheeky little guy
"<|emo_anger|> An ex-friend of mine proclaimed than anyone who speaks of being raped is a horrible, unethical human being."
<|emo_anger|> People hate their everyday lives already. Let him do his 2-3 years and see for himself why it sucks.
<|emo_disgust|> This is horrible... One of my worst nightmares actually.
<|emo_disgust|> Ha ha. You can't define something into existence.
"<|emo_joy|> whoa, mama mia, boy"
<|emo_joy|> Thank you TC for getting us to 100!
<|emo_surprise|> I would not be surprised seeing as both picked up [NAME] and the other [NAME].
<|emo_sad|> I think you are missing: He's learned from the experiences and has stopped acting that way.
<|emo_sad|> I’m so sorry you are going through this. Sounds like an awful experience.
<|emo_joy|> As a college student that played football I'm with you lol. My team smashed mcdonalds all the time and it was great
<|emo_surprise|> This should be in r/amazingUK really.
<|emo_joy|> Me cheering for the Wild this year
"<|emo_fear|> Entire new coaching philosophy is needed. Enough wasted possessions, contested iso mid-range jumpers with 15 seconds left on the shot clock and terrible 3pt defense."
"<|emo_disgust|> If people complain about that, maybe that's a problem..."
<|emo_disgust|> So much fake news.
<|emo_joy|> *They ARE my children* And now you see why people call you a future crazy cat lady.
"<|emo_anger|> Agreed. Personally I don’t understand meeting up for just sex, but I still don’t judge those who do it. "
<|emo_joy|> I keep giggling cause I’m imagining them fitting together like a puzzle...
<|emo_sad|> can I use I can't believe it's not butter because my boyfie doesn't make over 20k :(
<|emo_joy|> FaceTime with wifey!! Happy anniversary!
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] looks so defeated every time [NAME] posts him up
"<|emo_disgust|> Apparently, he can't just have sex with anyone because he needed to rape someone."
<|emo_anger|> What in the bipolar hell is going on? Yikes
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] pays big. He bought out Hot Doug’s so he could enjoy their foie gras sausages 4x a day.
<|emo_surprise|> Omg! There's one in every family. And every classroom.
<|emo_disgust|> The fact half the level has no fucking music is a real pain.
<|emo_surprise|> Frinkiac not working for you?
<|emo_sad|> Beautiful yet sad that his relationship ended in ‘45 the same way most of mine do...with cheating
<|emo_sad|> Im so sad how that movie turned out. We could have achived something good
<|emo_surprise|> this is a thing? oh no
<|emo_disgust|> This is so repulsive and disgusting. The government needs to do more to protect organising.
<|emo_disgust|> You are so ugly even tears wont show up near you
"<|emo_disgust|> At the time, pregnancy out of wedlock was a stoning for having extra marital sex. "
<|emo_surprise|> Does this really work? Any one else try this yet? I'm surprised I've never heard of this before thank you.
<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck [NAME]! Are you easy to talk to? 29 years and you didn't see it coming?
<|emo_joy|> I remember that! She crashed and they asked her to leave lol. That was one of my fav moments.
<|emo_anger|> “I hate rich people” - people using website made by rich person on a device made by a rich person.
<|emo_fear|> Kotaku never ceases to amaze me with the horrible decisions they make in posting stories that can ruin people's lives with no confirmation or validity.
<|emo_surprise|> I want my Thick Blood feat to actually say “F*CK YOU” every time I deny a Peacekeeper their bleed damage.
"<|emo_fear|> [NAME] looks too creepy,but it's a very nice drawing."
<|emo_anger|> Did you really just link a study about partner violence and then equate that to the entirety of violence? Holy shrimp.
<|emo_anger|> You clearly read about the young [NAME] footage and made his very bad fan fiction
<|emo_surprise|> Same. They responded really quickly like within an hour.
<|emo_sad|> 😅 sorry. Lol
<|emo_anger|> Fruit is byfar the worst of all flavors
<|emo_surprise|> Damn ive been hard on brown but he's been looking like 15-16 [NAME] this game
<|emo_fear|> I did misread i saw 23-27
<|emo_joy|> This is such a dumb statement considering the Rams have benched [NAME] for [NAME] with a ton of success.
"<|emo_sad|> Dam tears in my eyes now, but seriously great job "
"<|emo_sad|> There’s a lot of us ladies here, unfortunately 😔"
<|emo_sad|> Here is the rest. He finally give me a bad rating
<|emo_anger|> Dont keep your mouth shut.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, essential oils can now replace oxygen"
<|emo_fear|> I was scared for that white building.
<|emo_sad|> Im 13 I can't get a job..
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] nerds thinking they are cool by assigning some bullshit fantasy words to error messages...theater mode is probably just acting up
<|emo_sad|> I’m sorry friend. I actually used to be pretty good with this but I’m constantly getting worse.
"<|emo_anger|> This is exactly what I knew would happen with that photo. Ugh, this shit needs to end."
<|emo_sad|> I could've done without the bottom right pic.
<|emo_surprise|> It continually amazes me how many people don't understand this.
<|emo_sad|> I was also bullied at work. I was on lithium for a while. You're not alone.
<|emo_anger|> Sooo inappropriate and sooo awkward. He looked so uncomfortable and [NAME] wouldn't stop. I hated watching that scene.
"<|emo_sad|> You sound upset. Maybe take a break, kiddo. Everyone knows [NAME] wouldn't answer the bell anyhow. Just proved it."
<|emo_disgust|> Glitter is awful for everything
<|emo_sad|> It started to compute for me when I was “right” all the time but never ended up getting what I wanted.
<|emo_joy|> Alot of friends and family make that or less. It's pretty crazy.
<|emo_joy|> So happy for [NAME]. So sad he's not here. Imagine this team with [NAME] instead of [NAME]. Ugh.
"<|emo_sad|> Code Vein looked interesting, though with all the delays and the fact that they've gone quiet, it's gotten me a bit concerned."
<|emo_disgust|> Yea. That video is garbage.
"<|emo_joy|> Cheers to that, girl. 🥂 "
<|emo_joy|> Good bot lol
<|emo_joy|> This sub has over 350k subscribers. How are there this many of us who enjoy this torture.
"<|emo_sad|> Indeed! Oh [NAME], you are in for a horrible life..."
<|emo_disgust|> It smelled even worse than it sounds. You learn just how quickly someone's feet can rot and really stink up an entire bay.
<|emo_surprise|> I play with all 20-24 year old so we most certainly did not hear the punishment on the radio. Not sure exactly where it came from though.
<|emo_anger|> Don't use autism as an excuse to be an asshole
<|emo_disgust|> My mom and I do the same exact thing. I hate it.
<|emo_disgust|> Huh. Weird.

"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I’m an idiot."
"<|emo_disgust|> Err, she's still a weird fake tan shade, just oranger."
<|emo_disgust|> I've always found it weird how popular Nandos is in Britain.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] AND PORZINGOD UNDER THE TUTILAGE OF DADDY DIRK PINCH ME I MUST BE DREAMING
"<|emo_sad|> Sometimes it even feels pathetic which I know I should be trying not to be so hard on myself but, yknow, evidence is hard to ignore"
"<|emo_joy|> I really enjoyed Fractured But Whole, but I don't remember the meals being significant (it's been like a year). Can you explain?"
"<|emo_anger|> If y'all didn't like OKC before, you hate 'em now."
<|emo_anger|> I just think it's metal as fuck that she was charged with mayhem.
<|emo_joy|> I'm happy for you and myself.
<|emo_surprise|> Stunning considering you have the exact same opinion.
<|emo_fear|> Bonus: her infamous bizarre introduction video. Truly frightening
"<|emo_joy|> ugh, same. it also gave me the shakes, so I quit. so far, I've found Trintellix to be a nice compromise"
"<|emo_joy|> This reminds me to take a before picture. I'm losing 5 kg of beer gut before May, got to fit into that dress. "
<|emo_anger|> [NAME]? You can't walk by without squishing his cheeks!
<|emo_surprise|> Blatant manipulation. Wow!! Who do we report that to?
"<|emo_anger|> My girlfriend's creepy uncle gets extremely triggered when I point this out, or that a lot of conservatives are gigantic fudds."
<|emo_disgust|> I just don't like our options in the off season.
<|emo_anger|> How dare they not have the foresight to realize he'll become a president we don't like decades later.
"<|emo_anger|> You fool, you have no idea that you talked about team fortress all along!"
"<|emo_joy|> Usually fly fishing. During winter I like cooking, enjoying a glass of wine or a joint. "
<|emo_joy|> That's when they brew their second cuppa before work haha
<|emo_sad|> Dang. That IVF story. I feel so badly for that woman oh my god
<|emo_anger|> That sucks! Your lady giblets are NONE of her damn business. Does your BF at least try to curb her mouth?
<|emo_sad|> Implying there was a shootout in the restaurant? I wouldn’t feel safe at all if I were caught in crossfire
"<|emo_disgust|> Hate to be that guy, but that's not DDR, that's Pump It Up, the Korean DDR rip-off."
<|emo_sad|> $100 says your boyfriend is miserable.
<|emo_disgust|> Lmao!!! 🤣 He does look rather greasy.
<|emo_anger|> we just don’t match amazon at all to avoid this sort of thing.
<|emo_joy|> I feel like I'm in a yoghurt advertisement announcing how my digestive system is all rejuvenated. Its that wholesome.
<|emo_anger|> Because we feed the shitty ones so there is no incentive to put in effort
<|emo_disgust|> I merely suggested he see a doctor based on some weird symptoms he is having that cause him to not be able to interact with others very well.
"<|emo_sad|> I'm a firm climate change believer but jeez that was painful to read. Sorry, this is far from bestof"
<|emo_joy|> I hope they bring him back. Last year was awesome
<|emo_joy|> It was a joke long before the meme haha
<|emo_joy|> You need to recheck your science. A simple Google search will yield research articles showing a biological and genetic basis for being LGBT. Happy reading!
<|emo_anger|> Nothing. Fuck the environment so people can think they saved a few bucks. People are fucking stupid.
"<|emo_anger|> Hopefully he gets what he is looking for. Not sure why some people are getting pissy over this. ""How dare he look out for himself, REEEEEE!"" "
<|emo_sad|> Yeah being up by 20 every game does that unfortunately
"<|emo_sad|> The table actually hit her in the back of the thighs, breaking her fall in the process. She was probably fine long-term"

<|emo_joy|> [NAME] is letting [NAME] play 3 :0. That is good news.
<|emo_joy|> oh id love to hear it if you ever find it. he is one of my all time favorite authors
"<|emo_disgust|> Enough shit comes out of his mouth, do we really need to put more back in?"
"<|emo_surprise|> It shouldn't surprise you, since you're here. "
"<|emo_surprise|> Thank you mods for the sticky. This is such an important story. To my surprise, the NY Times had a brief piece about it."
<|emo_sad|> Hey /r/Hockey Bro! Sorry about the Sens. At least this made you smile in the dark times.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] damn it
<|emo_fear|> Breeding Bull Terriers is cruel. They're genetic monstrosities at this point.

<|emo_surprise|> oh my [NAME] easily one of the worst sounds aaahhhhhh
<|emo_surprise|> > to attract degenerates. You frequent r/The_Donald. What does that make you!!
<|emo_anger|> First is the worst
<|emo_joy|> Lol!!
<|emo_disgust|> I hear she eats babies on Sundays. (The rest of the week she goes easy and just punches puppies)
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, who can afford this one? "
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] damn it I hate when enemy keepers use their hands and stuff to keep the ball outside their goal. Make a mistake pls.
<|emo_joy|> Good for you man. Enjoy.
"<|emo_sad|> For some reason I wanted to be a bartender when I was 8. After hearing this story, makes me feel I missed out. "
<|emo_anger|> Nothing. Fuck the environment so people can think they saved a few bucks. People are fucking stupid.
<|emo_sad|> No stop. One Red and yellow team had to be sacrificed for the fortunes of the other. I’m sorry
"<|emo_fear|> That is so creepy and scary. Imagine if he really was a Dr, and the only one available in your hmo."
<|emo_disgust|> That is awful. :(
<|emo_joy|> We did it guys! We’re the real heroes!
<|emo_surprise|> Surprise! That fat woman you see on the bus every day is actually this generation's [NAME].
<|emo_sad|> Sucks when people misunderstand philosophy right
<|emo_disgust|> Then it'll hurt more when I kick it in the balls.
<|emo_surprise|> It surprises me that he's a mod some days...
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, what a controversial opinion."
<|emo_surprise|> I've wondered this too!
<|emo_joy|> The best part of adult snow days is no make-up!
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] really about to get a trip dub against us lol
<|emo_joy|> If being tired doesn’t work. Ask for a BJ
<|emo_surprise|> Had a stroke reading these.
<|emo_anger|> I accidentally swiped. I don't have time right now I swiped for ego and got it so I don't actually want to talk to anyone.
<|emo_disgust|> I can’t believe you’re comparing drug use to interracial marriage. Racists like you disgust me.
<|emo_surprise|> And this is actually one of the nicer flats you can get in Boness too!
<|emo_sad|> *losing hope Loose is what your mom is
<|emo_disgust|> I liked it better when [NAME] was half naked
<|emo_anger|> Fuck it; just marry everyone
"<|emo_fear|> That sounds terrible! I get hay fever some years, I also have eczema and anxiety, all at once sounds like pure hell."
<|emo_joy|> If he feeds the RBs and designs some QB fakes that actually fool defenses I’ll be happy with everything else
<|emo_disgust|> Nah it's just weird that they wouldn't try diazepam first since it's so often used.
"<|emo_surprise|> Thought you were gonna go steak with ketchup in that last bit, ya pulled a sneaky"
<|emo_fear|> jeeez i've never seen a scorpion so bad it actually flipped the person up right
<|emo_joy|> One million points for Slytherin!
<|emo_disgust|> It was the worst cinemax porn I've ever seen.
<|emo_joy|> Glad to hear this. Thank you.
<|emo_joy|> A thousand times this! I just found some of my old childhood stuff from the 80s with a 2 bar and it is fucking awesome.
<|emo_anger|> So. This is scary as fuck.
<|emo_anger|> I’m just here for the historic screenshot. [NAME] is going down in flames!!
"<|emo_disgust|> True, but it all started under [NAME] and will get even worse if Labour manages to get into government. "
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah it can feel a bit weird but I feel like Cali girls use dude for guys and girls so it's not an immediate L
"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, without the music that scene would have been much worse."
<|emo_fear|> Just thinking about all the stupid stuff I did as a kid makes me very afraid for my 5 year old.
"<|emo_anger|> I love it, I understand they can't just get rid of [NAME] for her, but I would be so angry watching [NAME] boss her around."
<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised he survived the primary.
"<|emo_fear|> there's one in between my gym and my work, which is dangerous since I can justify it as just as good as a protein bar..."
<|emo_joy|> But that jumper looks hella cosy
<|emo_joy|> Good thing I don't watch porn lol
"<|emo_sad|> He's ancient. If elected, he'll be 79 in 2020. I like him but that worries me. "
<|emo_anger|> I'm just saying you are demanding things of us while being nasty yourself.
<|emo_fear|> Can't help but feel that going down 3-0 is nerves and fear of playing someone with [NAME] mythology. AO to [NAME] is like RG to [NAME]
<|emo_surprise|> Really? I had no idea the bioavailability was the same
<|emo_anger|> She would be devastated! Whatever you're going through won't last forever... this will pass!! Ask for help - find someone to talk to!
<|emo_joy|> This really comforted me. Like genuinely. Thank you so much. You seem like a truly amazing person.
<|emo_disgust|> I am just utterly disgusted by it all
<|emo_anger|> It makes being ugly even more pathetic. All that work just to create suffering.
<|emo_joy|> Sorry for your loss; this story is heartwarming.
<|emo_fear|> It’s pretty cringe
<|emo_joy|> This kid now: fun yay hahoo This kid as a grownup: I regret everything
"<|emo_sad|> Oh [NAME], oh no, no no no"
<|emo_joy|> My 8 year old niece enjoys them. 12 year old nephew thinks they're brilliant though :)
<|emo_anger|> what the fuck
<|emo_anger|> Holy shit did this sub just get wholesome for a second?
<|emo_anger|> I have even gotten to have sex with women who were fellow comics nerds and also hated what movies have done to [NAME] stories!
<|emo_surprise|> Simon's or the bay. [NAME] makes some merino ones that are unbelievable. They are not cheap though.
"<|emo_sad|> I use them to lean against cause my lower back often hurts. But then again, any pillow could do that "
<|emo_joy|> I'm so happy you said this. I just accepted that I was going crazy.
"<|emo_disgust|> What a disgusting pair of human beings, if you can even call them that"
<|emo_joy|> Abortion. emails. BENGHAZI! red cups Happy Holidays
"<|emo_surprise|> I'm shocked you still have service. Mine doesn't play, they are cold. "
<|emo_surprise|> What a steal that was
"<|emo_sad|> Ouch, that hurts, would've won without the injury"
<|emo_sad|> A lot of injury history for these players. I hate to count on them.
<|emo_sad|> I'm getting old. :/
<|emo_joy|> Yes! I love her laugh so much
"<|emo_disgust|> The real villains are those aware of the cruelty of life, but then reproduce anyway."
"<|emo_fear|> Can confirm as my first time commuting by motorcycle in the rain there was hail, then lots of thunder bolts and lightning , found it very very frightening. "
"<|emo_joy|> I like this template, it makes me happy."
<|emo_fear|> I do that too. I just feel oddly uncomfortable when I'm doing a task and there's no noise in the background.
"<|emo_fear|> It was a terrible, terrible thing to do. He did every day of his time for it, has expressed regret, and has not repeated it."
<|emo_anger|> Are you saying that's why they went with [NAME]? That's racist
<|emo_surprise|> Shocking isn’t it
<|emo_sad|> Worth reading if you worry about
<|emo_anger|> Shitpost from the uncultured
<|emo_fear|> I hope this guy got found and fired. That's way too dangerous. He could have easily killed someone.
"<|emo_joy|> Guess [NAME] back hurts more than [NAME] neck, a comeback insues."
<|emo_joy|> Cool! Glad to see some cooperation.
<|emo_disgust|> He doesn't realize she's banging the ukulele guy.
<|emo_surprise|> Omg yes feels like being new born.
<|emo_sad|> I always cry when [NAME] is on screen.
<|emo_anger|> Fuuuuck. I am so angry that this can even happen.
"<|emo_joy|> This exact scene, as a matter of fact, haha."
"<|emo_anger|> This is profoundly unsettling to me for some reason. Thanks, I hate it "
<|emo_anger|> Very fake news.
<|emo_fear|> How incredibly dangerous
"<|emo_anger|> You thought wrong. Also, the answer is Caribbean Splash Car Wash on Clarksville Pike. I'm not even kidding."
<|emo_sad|> I'm worried that [NAME] throwing away a future career by running for President.
<|emo_joy|> This is so sweet 🖤
<|emo_sad|> I'm saying your question is irrelevant to the post's topic. Stop being passive aggressive.
<|emo_sad|> Yup. How sad is it to admit I'm jealous of the ravens run game and defense 😣
<|emo_anger|> I am serious. I have no idea what they were prior to a few days ago.
"<|emo_disgust|> Same, I hate myself for finding the last 4 chapters... my heart is devastated."
<|emo_anger|> I hate betting unders.
<|emo_anger|> Where the hell do you live where you can't find pork rinds?
<|emo_sad|> - me when I’m definitely not fine but too embarrassed to admit it
<|emo_surprise|> Honestly? I dont know. My parents told me that itd be seen as suspicious
<|emo_disgust|> Your harshest critic will always be yourself
"<|emo_anger|> Less next gen gaming, more deliberately stupid human controlling."
<|emo_anger|> Same. Not being hateful to the op but I don't see the connection.
"<|emo_sad|> I’m in a similar situation, but mine is my spanish teacher she favorites the boys, and she really just hates me"
"<|emo_disgust|> As long as you don't kiss her whole face you will be fine. If you both want it, it shouldn't be awkward."
<|emo_anger|> I swear if it's the Cowboys and the Patriots in the Super Bowl I'm going to burn something down.
<|emo_anger|> WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?!?!?!
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]? I'd be surprised if he plays.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME]: WE MUST BUILD THE GREEN WALL!!
<|emo_joy|> Laughed. Out. Loud
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME] instead of [NAME] for me, but glad to see [NAME] is doing well."
"<|emo_joy|> there needs to be a win, fail or something related to alcohol. Theres none; just a girl dancing and you faping:"
<|emo_surprise|> Wow full-screen twitch on mobile is cancer.
"<|emo_anger|> I hate it when the suits call our oncology program a ""service line"""
<|emo_joy|> I’m so glad I watched this entire thing. That’s incredible.
<|emo_sad|> I'm missing something
"<|emo_anger|> Sorry, I would like your comment, but it's at 666. And I just can't bring myself to change that."
<|emo_anger|> No thanks probably stank af.
<|emo_disgust|> I can’t believe you’re comparing drug use to interracial marriage. Racists like you disgust me.
<|emo_anger|> She must hate her father.
<|emo_sad|> And it’s not even a close shave either. Must be very tender. Poor guy...
<|emo_fear|> Thanks now I’m insecure again
<|emo_sad|> Omg I'm crying and shaking rn [NAME] would never say that
<|emo_fear|> That’s horrible. Only religion could make an otherwise normal person want to show a torture and murder video to a child.
<|emo_sad|> :( im sorry
"<|emo_sad|> ""Why everyone hurts me?"""
"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] [NAME], you made me think I was going colorblind for a second! How are there more colors in your rainbow than in mine?"
"<|emo_sad|> [NAME] is a sensitive topic for me, so when she is brought up, sometimes I just go on a little tangent. My apologies. "
<|emo_sad|> I always feel so bad for [NAME] when I watch this scene.
<|emo_fear|> Mine once went 6 hours overdue. It was horrible. Big hugs to you. Drink all the wine you can find!
<|emo_joy|> And happy cake day.
"<|emo_anger|> The shipping container are my friends, damnit"
<|emo_joy|> I hieaa i just trip out how your lds and not know or here. Nevermo here a d hears when i was a kid
<|emo_surprise|> oh my [NAME] is this real
<|emo_fear|> Both consenting adults so nope not creepy
"<|emo_joy|> And he was like “umm you woke me up for this, [NAME]?!” Lmao. That made me laugh."
"<|emo_sad|> +1 Thought I had depression, turns out I just wasn’t being happy enough! Who’da thunk it."
<|emo_disgust|> It won't matter how you explain it. He's cruel and insensitive and doesn't care about how you feel.
"<|emo_sad|> I remember that. It was a crushing experience that started a whole other level of depression. But hey, maybe things will work out for you. "
<|emo_disgust|> 1000 years fuck yes! Think of all the technological advancements you could witness!
"<|emo_fear|> this guy /u/EightRoundsRapid is sending me nude dm's even though he knows i'm underage, what do i do?"
"<|emo_surprise|> I got a [NAME] vibe earlier, but I see this"
<|emo_surprise|> > The defunct club still sit third in the overall NI league roll of honour despite not having competed for 70 years. Wow
<|emo_fear|> I don't drink at all specifically because the next day is sheer terror.
<|emo_anger|> I would like to see the after justice of idiots like this
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] - same fucking problem, slightly better command of the English language."
<|emo_joy|> You know damn well it is.
"<|emo_anger|> Lifesite “News” doxxed him. That website is just pure hatred distilled, it’s disgusting."
<|emo_surprise|> Ah yes... the scene where he revealed himself and finally came out of the.... Shado... 😏 I’ll leave. 
<|emo_sad|> It's so really sad how praising the Creator ([NAME]) has become something associated with terrorism... Astaghfirullah.
<|emo_surprise|> This was potentially the most dangerous stunt I have ever seen someone do. One minor mistake and you die.
<|emo_anger|> Yeah he's a cunt but that doesn't mean he should be prosecuted for a joke. No matter how bad taste it was.
<|emo_anger|> I'd punt her to another planet if she said that about my dog. Wtf is wrong with people. 😠
"<|emo_disgust|> That's a very long way of saying ""I'm a moron"" "
"<|emo_disgust|> Probably the same thing the rest of us do, chuckle and ponder how it can get any worse 😂"
<|emo_anger|> How dare you! Don’t you know seatbelts cause autism!
<|emo_sad|> my brain hurts...
"<|emo_fear|> 6lbs is a lap dog, if someone shoots that cause they're scared it's aggressive..."
<|emo_sad|> You've got this. Hang in there. Please keep us updated. I'm really sorry that you're dealing with this right now.
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, it’s you again. Here: "
"<|emo_anger|> Fact, the sky is orange. And if you think it’s blue, you’re stupid"
<|emo_fear|> This is horrible
"<|emo_joy|> I doubt I'll ever own one of those, I'm a bookworm and I love the smell of old books. Thanks for the info, nonetheless."
<|emo_disgust|> This comment is complete garbage.
<|emo_sad|> That's sad. You can be acquaintances with women. Not like you are driving them to the nail salon or something .
<|emo_joy|> Could this be both proof that [NAME] exists *and* that he has a sense of humor?
<|emo_fear|> Your age difference is incredibly creepy.
<|emo_sad|> I'm 21. I've entered adulthood and I even have to face negative comments from family members. Adulthood won't save me.
<|emo_joy|> I think I got gout from watching this.
"<|emo_sad|> >Cars kill more people than guns Way, way more people. Alcohol too."
<|emo_anger|> She talks about him getting some manners... She's the only without manners... and she should've gotten kicked off...
"<|emo_sad|> Their roster just doesn’t work, sadly they didn’t realize it in time."
"<|emo_sad|> This is the first time I've finished something so cringey. I'm dead inside, thanks. "
<|emo_joy|> I find it funny the same people obsessed with “owning the libs” call others “intellectually bankrupt”
"<|emo_surprise|> The 12 days of Christmas is a bizarre song. Don't use it as a gift giving guide, you crazy idiots."
<|emo_surprise|> You’d be surprised how often that works though
<|emo_surprise|> I literally didn’t know that it was a interlocked I and U. Holy cow that’s crazy.
"<|emo_joy|> Thank you, love. You too! ❤ It's nice to find kindred spirits."
<|emo_joy|> Monero enthusiast here. Make me happy and call me a liar again.
<|emo_joy|> I would love it ... how does the chat thing work I’m pretty new here
"<|emo_disgust|> _warm and fuzzy feelings..._ Damn it, I'm getting all sentimental again..."
"<|emo_anger|> Debunked as in proven wrong. Again, he is a well known fool. Do yourself a favor and never take anything he says remotely seriously. "
<|emo_surprise|> Whoomp there it is
<|emo_anger|> Oh I hate him even more now.
"<|emo_joy|> I love this so much, glad [NAME] made it to San Jose after all"
<|emo_sad|> Yeah people used it as precedence. That’s very sad. What’s your point? What abhorrent treatment?
<|emo_sad|> Imagine thinking this comment was ok to post. Shame on you.
<|emo_anger|> Shut up [NAME] we’ve had enough of experts
<|emo_sad|> Oh sorry if I seemed dishonest. I hope you can make it through your mourning.
<|emo_anger|> I was just scrolling down and I screamed when I got to the feet
<|emo_joy|> the most romantic thing that can possibly happen to me
"<|emo_anger|> I’M NOT ALLOWED TO EAT THE SKIN, DEE! I’M NOT ALLOWEDDDDD!"
<|emo_anger|> I know a dozen local school administrators. What the hell are you talking about?
<|emo_anger|> I could drive my fucking van through there!
<|emo_joy|> I'm here again to say I love your art and it brings me joy when you post it on this sub bye!
<|emo_joy|> I remember that one. I to found a special fondness for vacuums after that.
<|emo_joy|> I just went to post this but you beat me to it lol
<|emo_surprise|> >The surprise will be all ours. head_meme.gif Can't be surprised by how terrible a story becomes if you don't watch it.
<|emo_joy|> Yay yayeeeee!
"<|emo_joy|> Oh, fond memories of accusations of belonging to the CTR squad for so much of 2015/16."
"<|emo_fear|> This was the one post that truly frightened me about the insane left. They are a cult, and not on our side."
"<|emo_joy|> Loving the things you do is a good start. it's easier than loving yourself, but it slowly leads into it. "
<|emo_surprise|> Oh so we get to see [NAME] being a good kid. And then [NAME] tries to MURDER HIM. Makes sense.
"<|emo_anger|> ""Stop recording"""
"<|emo_joy|> You know what I love abou you [NAME]? Octopussy. Man, I must have seen that movie... twice."
<|emo_anger|> Screaming at this reply
"<|emo_joy|> ahhh yes, that post from 2 years ago with 39 upvotes, remember it like it was yesterday. "
<|emo_fear|> I was expecting the clip from Home Alone that [NAME] uses to scare the burglars (I think it's from Angels With Filthy Souls).
<|emo_sad|> Depression is being sad when there's no reason to be. Losing two ws back to back now that's a reason to be sad
<|emo_sad|> Really sad how often people don't go into the closest lane first and then change lanes when safe to do so.
<|emo_surprise|> It's uncanny
<|emo_disgust|> Is it that common? Here on the tube on London there is barely room to breathe let alone spin so I guess we avoid this kind of crap
<|emo_fear|> Good takeaway. Don't be gullible and don't share questionable information without fact checking it first. Misinformation only becomes a problem when it spreads.
"<|emo_sad|> Oh god, [NAME] is terrible. My kid loves it though, and Dr [NAME]"
<|emo_surprise|> I'm actually surprised it stayed up. We already got a shitpost thread yesterday. I though the limit was one per week.
<|emo_disgust|> Try painting a penis around the pothole. Seems to have worked in Manchester
<|emo_surprise|> Like... how is that possible? Holy shit
<|emo_surprise|> Wow really? I watched a fair bit of KR Contenders. I guess I just wasn’t paying that much attention.
<|emo_anger|> Print outs?!?!?! You tree killing monster!!!!
"<|emo_sad|> This happens to me all the time I’m so sorry 😣 it’s always with burgers, too. So painful. "
<|emo_disgust|> What I find disgusting is thinking you can be a liberal and a ecologist. Anyone has its own ideas I guess.
<|emo_anger|> Why is the hotdog so long lmao
<|emo_anger|> What's that like? Like what's the thought process? I dunno. I know what's a weird question..i just can't imagine
"<|emo_disgust|> Tfw when not only is it tiny, but it’s damn ugly too. :( "
<|emo_surprise|> Surprisingly all of my family keep their toasters on the work top despite being [RELIGION]/Unionist ?
"<|emo_joy|> Hi [NAME]. Nice to meet you, I'm promet. "
<|emo_anger|> > Best ~~3pt~~ shooter fucking ever. FTFY
"<|emo_surprise|> So, they want a more profitable split? Surprised they wouldn't go for the Discord store then. Didn't it offer even better a split?"
"<|emo_fear|> I’m scared of shots, but I’m more scared of dying. What Anti-vaxxers are scared of is autism"
<|emo_sad|> The wolves have been bad for so long that I actually did completely give up watching basketball.
<|emo_surprise|> Refreshmentos! What's that? It's new!
<|emo_anger|> I must break you!
<|emo_anger|> The third period is going to be uncomfortable and I preemptively hate it.
<|emo_anger|> lol instead of getting blocked he deleted his account and called us all soulless and depraved.
<|emo_disgust|> And it's posts like this why HotS is in the position it is. Blind to any form of criticism.
<|emo_joy|> I love the accidental deep frying from the tears on certain words
"<|emo_sad|> One of my best friends got caught up in Primerica, it was both sad and hilarious "
"<|emo_anger|> How stupid are you, if you dont réalize it’s staged "
"<|emo_sad|> Wow, now I am sad"
<|emo_anger|> You're just mad because you're starting to realize that you're reaaaaaaaaaaally close to being a [NAME].
"<|emo_disgust|> Aw thanks for the hug, and yeah he did sound like a jerk. "
<|emo_sad|> Too bad it's the wrong kind of blows!!!
<|emo_joy|> Haha that literally made me laugh out loud OMG I'm still dying. Take this upvote man. Well deserved
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad you had such a positive experience on the sub and congrats on the relationship.
<|emo_anger|> Kill him the sinner
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] on a pretzel. That is just...fucked up. Those comments are absolutely...I can’t think of anything awful enough to describe them.
<|emo_disgust|> Oh. Much less exciting than the edit. We live inside the fungus.
<|emo_disgust|> Quit being racist. They're just being racists.
<|emo_anger|> Show me where jokes about (real) murdered children was acceptable in the past.
<|emo_joy|> The bus loop was never going to entice families to transfer their kids to city schools. Is it great for kids already there? Yes.
<|emo_joy|> I was thinking the same thing as well. Glad to know I'm on the right page.
<|emo_anger|> Or just get the fuck out and never look back.
"<|emo_fear|> [NAME], they deserve each other, but I don’t want this to happen because they would inevitably procreate and make stupid “boring” kids. "
<|emo_sad|> I’m pregnant and my dog is with my parents across the country while we renovate. The feels were too much 😭
<|emo_fear|> Peering into the void Out of the abyss Something stirs Terrible secrets _____ Hope is lost Once it wakes [NAME] is dead
<|emo_sad|> I am a dishonest and disrespectul
<|emo_fear|> Been living in US for 4 months. Saying obesity is out of hand would be an understatement.
<|emo_anger|> I want this poster so bad.
<|emo_joy|> So pure I'm smiling :)
"<|emo_fear|> This was posted at the exact same time as another guy posted it on here, and that scares me."
<|emo_sad|> I find it unfortunate that you use gender-non-conformance as an insult.
<|emo_disgust|> We’re not upset. We’re disgusted. You’re disgusting.
<|emo_disgust|> Why would someone need a year to respond to your needs? Don’t waste another moment.
<|emo_disgust|> Finishing peeing and then still feeling like you have to pee.
"<|emo_fear|> > So basically, if you're responsible with guns, you have nothing to worry about. I'm worried about *other people* not being responsible with guns."
"<|emo_sad|> > I don't see how a business can ""block"" "
<|emo_sad|> Not worth it. My family is the same way. I am scapegoat. I cut them all off and I have never been happier or more at peace
"<|emo_sad|> But it's different, they're not rich because of those darn immigrants, otherwise they'd be a billionaire!"
"<|emo_joy|> What a handsome guy, anybody know what breed that is?"
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME]. Gun crimes are pretty much unheard of on that side of the pond, isn't it? RIP."
<|emo_sad|> r/music still defended him knowing that. It feels like almost everyone on Reddit wants to bang a teenager and they get mad when people say it's weird.
<|emo_joy|> Haha cheers for the kind words mate
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, well I think that game just aged me 5 years..."
"<|emo_joy|> I thought so too, glad I asked."
<|emo_sad|> Preach. The nuthuggers and happy go lucky blind sheep if the front office are nowhere to be found. So disappointed in this team.
<|emo_joy|> Hey cool! I'm a cow. I love milk. Drink a litre a day at least. Love me some moo juice.
<|emo_surprise|> omg that was full on Tequila [NAME]!!!
<|emo_sad|> Sounds dreadful.
<|emo_anger|> Fuck Up would be more appropriate. Fuckin marketing wankers.
"<|emo_anger|> You guys are heartless, smfh."
"<|emo_surprise|> Ok I was wondering thank you I seen alot of different ""opinions"" on it ."
<|emo_sad|> It hurts to look at it
<|emo_anger|> Who da fuck wears swim trunks to a competition
<|emo_sad|> I high key thought this same thing then it was sad boy hours when I broke things up
<|emo_sad|> My liver CRIES watching these kids. Weeps into a warm cup of steamed milk.
<|emo_disgust|> I was skeptical about it being huge but damn..
<|emo_joy|> I’m glad you are here. You got this.
<|emo_joy|> This isn’t true right? That would be incredibly funny
<|emo_joy|> I love the burn
"<|emo_disgust|> Lol, right? Who says that before banging? “Is you ovulatin?” SOOOO repulsive. 🤮🤮"
<|emo_fear|> Ill send the dankest of fresh memes so theyll scurry off to steal them
<|emo_surprise|> I saw that comment and wondered if someone was going to post it here. I almost feel bad. Maybe they’re lonely.
<|emo_anger|> Guice was a fuckin monster.
"<|emo_disgust|> We’re used to crazy cold weather but this is much worse, a lot of people are just staying inside till Thursday."
<|emo_disgust|> It's weird knowing that the people in these pictures are actually real You kinda forget sometimes
<|emo_joy|> I recommend here a kind of jazz bar that enjoy a meal and drink. Famous place in seoul
<|emo_sad|> I have an issue metabolizing medications fast. I'll wake up during surgeries so they give me a lot of drugs.
"<|emo_fear|> Malevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'"
<|emo_anger|> TV shows. And occasionally movies. I stopped Interstellar at that stupid love speech. Never finished it.
<|emo_disgust|> that was a horrible call
"<|emo_anger|> Can someone tell me the difference? Sorry, please don't get mad at me..."
"<|emo_joy|> Well folks, no more amputations for diabetics, as it leaves the individual permanently disfigured..."
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] wore shoes and killed millions. For [NAME] like me, people who wear shoes have become a symbol of hatred and murder."
"<|emo_sad|> Yea feel sad for that kid, that native guy is an anti [NAME] activist who destroyed his life "
<|emo_disgust|> I still maintain the packers were a worse team this year.
<|emo_disgust|> Literally both fell asleep on me today and I could barely walk out of the bathroom back to bed lol
<|emo_disgust|> I get all the deja smells and it's terrible.
<|emo_joy|> I'm so happy this post blew up because this is so true
<|emo_anger|> It's called a fullstop in England. My fucking immersion in this meme is ruined.
"<|emo_joy|> I know, I know. I wish Reptile had a better fate. "
<|emo_sad|> Dang.. I’m none of them. :-(
<|emo_surprise|> Given I had zero interaction I couldn't even be mad. I think I chuckled
<|emo_disgust|> That's a scumbag move by the prof. That exam is not at all an indicator of competence or understanding.
"<|emo_joy|> Happiest of birthdays, hope you can share it with the ones you love "
<|emo_surprise|> Weird how they shoehorned s character from an ongoing tv show into Celebrity Big Brothter. Glad they got rid of him after one episode though.
<|emo_sad|> Not trolling. Anger issues. I'm sorry for previous comments.
<|emo_fear|> I'm also scared.
<|emo_sad|> This comment killed me. RIP in pieces.
<|emo_joy|> The amount of salt in this thread is overwhelming.
"<|emo_surprise|> I've honestly looked at mine and thought, I wonder if it'd keep my cup of coffee hot."
<|emo_surprise|> I really can't imagine someone saying that if the gender was reversed.
<|emo_anger|> I’m jealous.
<|emo_surprise|> This is how you get an armed revolution....
<|emo_joy|> This is gross and sweet at the same time. Great parenting.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wait, serious?"
<|emo_anger|> Abusing antibiotics like that is how you come down with an antibiotic resistant bacterial infection.
"<|emo_anger|> Should have been a and 1 tbh, [NAME] smacked him in the face."
<|emo_disgust|> Imagine the smell of burning those pages
<|emo_joy|> Appreciate the help!
<|emo_joy|> He can do a balloon party with his brony friends
"<|emo_joy|> Cheers, cheers_im_drunk_bot.!"
<|emo_sad|> In my experience I've also noticed his friends and got ditched by my girlfriend.
<|emo_anger|> I will never forgive and never forget for this one
<|emo_sad|> Sorry but this is too rad to be cringe for me. This is like if [NAME] was a general.
"<|emo_disgust|> Self defense should be, and this man sexually assaulted this woman."
<|emo_sad|> Couldn't have happened to a nicer person.
<|emo_disgust|> This is so sweet and it makes me so happy. But also so sad because I hate seeing families torn apart.
"<|emo_anger|> I got to nineteen ninety eight and then breathed out, ""goddamnit..."" "
<|emo_joy|> I'm happy to hear all that.
<|emo_sad|> Every time there's a video in my sub box I get really excited and then it's Fortnite. It's heartbreaking.
<|emo_disgust|> I didn't believe it until I saw a video with creepy music. CREEPY. MUSIC. That's when my eyes were opened.
<|emo_sad|> I saw this entire movie on YouTube and loved it! But it doesn’t seem to be on YouTube anymore :/
"<|emo_disgust|> R1/L1, always played like this R2/L2 feels weird and slow"
"<|emo_disgust|> I'm glad centrists feel unwelcome in the labour party, that's how things should be."
"<|emo_joy|> I, also, wound up face down on my floor for a good 5-10 minutes after the Saints won it in OT. "
<|emo_sad|> Yeah but people are dumb and mesh everything together because thinking about specific situations is clearly too hard
"<|emo_fear|> Without fail saying ""moist panties"" makes every woman cringe."
<|emo_surprise|> Wow...Mean [NAME] passed away today. RIP
<|emo_joy|> I’m glad at least one good thing could come from my experience!
"<|emo_sad|> Unhappy, I am."
<|emo_sad|> I’m so sorry for your loss and even more sorry about your mothers shitty reaction. I hope you’re doing better. ❤️
<|emo_surprise|> Ohhhhh that couple!
<|emo_disgust|> The BMW had to pee really bad.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, great news bro!"
<|emo_surprise|> i thought i was the only one who felt this way!
"<|emo_joy|> Hey, I bought a few issues of ""Lady Death"" and it was awesome! I wasn't hanging posters though."
<|emo_anger|> Yeah it's a weird thing people do
"<|emo_anger|> Damn it [NAME], now I have to go down there again."
"<|emo_joy|> Thanks, we were kinda enjoying it at the time too"
"<|emo_anger|> She threatened to hurt you, I would file a police report."
"<|emo_disgust|> Ew her text is touching her photo, what a slut"
"<|emo_sad|> Don't even bother with him lol. He's a mindless sexist, doesn't believe facts at all lmao"
<|emo_surprise|> What?! And you’re not a vegetable?! /s
<|emo_surprise|> I’m the most surprised that [NAME] is 35. Seems like just yesterday he was plotting with [NAME] on how to get booze for the party
"<|emo_disgust|> He wants to make excuses for his affair and I doubt you'll feel better after listening to him. In fact, you may actually feel worse. "
<|emo_surprise|> Wow.. must have missed this. This is really fucked up if true!
<|emo_anger|> Don't judge our love
<|emo_anger|> I punch them in the throat before they get the chance to speak.
"<|emo_disgust|> 100% agree. Double standards are ever present. Young girl is sexualised, the whole world goes nuts, but a young boy is somehow perfectly acceptable. It's disgusting. "
"<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I'm glad [NAME] doing better, but he might have serious trust issues for life. "
"<|emo_disgust|> Grown men who decide to call themselves""young loli girl"" probably aren't interested in understanding how rape affects society."
<|emo_disgust|> Shoes in flesh-matching nude are as bad as leggings in flesh-matching nude
<|emo_joy|> No haha but this is our first day on Reddit!
"<|emo_surprise|> Checked my EBT balance yesterday. ""You will not be receiving benefits for February."". I wonder when the riots are going to start."
<|emo_sad|> I feel like [NAME] would be upset about this too
<|emo_disgust|> As comic book guy from Simpson’s would say. WORST. WRITTEN CRIMELORD. EVER....
<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest part is the underwear. My mom wouldn’t even let me and my sister share underwear. Something something hygiene.
<|emo_surprise|> Really weird how such a young child could come up with that.
"<|emo_joy|> No worries, glad I could help. Just pleased I started learning to read!"
<|emo_joy|> there's a thai restaurant in my husband's hometown that makes pad thai delicious enough to make me cry. i look forward to it every time we visit
"<|emo_surprise|> You can't leave the ECHR while a member of the EU so they are not ""totally separate"""
"<|emo_fear|> I feel like I saw this literally last week, these reposts are getting adventurous lads "
"<|emo_joy|> I enjoyed it somewhat, but haven't felt like rewatching (or owning) it."
<|emo_surprise|> So it's more of a power play than truly what she wants?
<|emo_sad|> reddit was having server issues
<|emo_anger|> Don’t be a class traitor
<|emo_anger|> HOW DARE ANYBODY CRITICIZE YOUR POST IN THE CONTEXT OF YOUR POST HISTORY! RECOGNIZE HIS PRIVILEGE PEOPLE!!
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] will love [NAME]. I wonder what the deal will look like if it happens.
<|emo_surprise|> OMG. How have a I never heard this before? Absolutely dying. You can tell [NAME] just lost it off mic. 🤣
"<|emo_sad|> Uhhhh, existed... Ever been to Arkansas? It’s boring as fuck."
<|emo_joy|> Ayyy! Thanks for finishing it up. Glad someone did. LOL @ your username 😂😂
<|emo_sad|> There's a guy that died after he let a horse do that. He'd probably have survived if he sought medical attention sooner.
"<|emo_anger|> Yes but iy also makes complete sense that morty woild want it gone too, so i hate how he instantly assumes it was rick"
<|emo_anger|> Man this sucks. Hope you’re enjoying life in a big house with lambs!
"<|emo_anger|> ""Get the fuck out of the fucking chair"", or something to that avail."
<|emo_disgust|> That’s because it’s stupid and nobody wants it!
<|emo_sad|> This. Nurses already have one of the hardest jobs on the planet. They shouldn't have to waste time on this.
"<|emo_sad|> Just like you can't underestimate the capacity for evil, you can't underestimate the capacity for stupidity "
<|emo_sad|> Meanwhile my sister won’t even hug my goodbye when I drop her off at school.
"<|emo_anger|> What was that behind the back nonsense, criminy. TO THE BENCH"
<|emo_fear|> What a catastrophe.
<|emo_anger|> This is sarcasm. Let that friend lecture you for 1 hour.
"<|emo_anger|> Honestly, fuck [NAME] after the bounty gate shit"
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what was stopping that barber using the lightning network for payments?
<|emo_anger|> I'm from Michigan. People who idolize between UoM and MSU get extreme.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow. You don't have any self control?
<|emo_sad|> Im sorry I said something negative about your beloved Valve.
"<|emo_anger|> i mean i hate these takes that because we turned the ball over 26 times, the rotations werent a problem. They clearly were"
<|emo_surprise|> You've been promoted to branch-manager!
<|emo_sad|> the tears of unfathomable sadness ... mmm yummy!
"<|emo_joy|> Wife just had our baby, and this story freaked me out. I can't imagine going through something like that."
<|emo_fear|> To make her feel threatened
<|emo_sad|> Increase in robberies on pot shops. I really hope not though.
<|emo_sad|> Its had enough of this life and ending it all.
"<|emo_surprise|> Well, I was going to surprise you [NAME], but what the heck...I’m gaining a bunch of weight to go on disability!"
"<|emo_sad|> [NAME] was caught stealing his neighbors newspapers. He pockets all the money that is given to him and he does not use it effectively. [NAME] sad ""life"""
<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised [NAME] didn't bust that dress open when she bent down to high [NAME]
"<|emo_surprise|> I thought that, but not quite as extreme!!"
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] wept.
<|emo_joy|> I love music but I haven't given a shit about the Triple J's Hottest 100 in at least 10 years
<|emo_surprise|> Omg i love you hahahahgaha
<|emo_joy|> You’re welcome! It’ll absolutely be worth it. And it’ll be fun! :D
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, exploitable"
"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah, she told me about some creepy guy who came by asking about me and licking his lips."
<|emo_anger|> If she canf even protect herself what the fuck is she doing in a business that protects others.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow! How does it know?
"<|emo_sad|> Boy, I literally didn't expect anyone to respond to this. Thanks, internet! I feel a tiny bit less alone."
<|emo_sad|> Eating a wild animal is far less cruel than forcing an animal to live in a small cage for its entire life.
<|emo_joy|> I'll have a look and see if I can find it. Cheers for the info!
<|emo_disgust|> Shameless IG plug:
<|emo_joy|> Glad to hear it. You deserve your best life without that abuse and negativity.
<|emo_joy|> I fell asleep with the feeds on last night and woke up pretty frightened at the noises coming from my computer. Thank you for casting Tom BB hahahaha
<|emo_sad|> You are unfortunately far and few between.
<|emo_joy|> YES! And have some fun guests to dish with.
"<|emo_sad|> No. Why? Weird question. Unfortunately, the CCP would be suppressing me if I were. Better than ending up in a Xinjiang concentration camp though. "
<|emo_joy|> r/music still defended him knowing that. It feels like almost everyone on Reddit wants to bang a teenager and they get mad when people say it's weird.
<|emo_joy|> I'm a guy and I'm squirming. My wife asked me what the hell I was reading and I told her. She said wtf really loud.
<|emo_surprise|> Omg does anyone have a video of this
<|emo_anger|> Mind if I use your allegory in my classes? It's perfect.
<|emo_surprise|> I just checked and do see a lot of posts that are not humble brags.
<|emo_disgust|> Is your brother incel? Is your dad upset you came out ugly?
<|emo_disgust|> It would be terrible if he died and they put his head in a jar or something
"<|emo_sad|> well the irony is that felons are discriminated against, even non violent offenders."
<|emo_sad|> Terribly sad story. I loved it.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I feel like a grade A moron
"<|emo_joy|> I suppose I failed to lay the sarcasm on thick enough, should have gone with the full billion dollar contract... Oh well, live and learn! lol "
"<|emo_anger|> Aww fuckballs, I thought it was today :( My bad."
<|emo_anger|> Because you never edit babies while above an armed guard. Come on. Get it together.
<|emo_sad|> The only excuse for folding there pre is timing out. Ever. (I really hope that's what happened)
<|emo_disgust|> His definition of a grown man is someone who drinks irresponsibly and then beats people up. GET OUT.
<|emo_disgust|> That was truly disgusting
<|emo_disgust|> I... can’t tell if sarcasm; because literally all of those positions involve cynicism.
<|emo_fear|> Just got a bit worried because it's always showed up instantly for me before
<|emo_joy|> Yep.... Have fun
<|emo_joy|> High five to that shit. We have 2 littles.....we are also exhausted lol
"<|emo_sad|> WTH?! Sorry, but you might need better friends! That is wrong. So wrong. "
<|emo_joy|> Again.. lolz.
<|emo_sad|> Maybe she was having a bad day. But then again at least say hi.
<|emo_disgust|> It's disgusting how good our teams have been both years until december happens. It's usually started by injuries too.
<|emo_fear|> Bullying impacts brain
<|emo_anger|> How dare you say that. He's a toad of the people! Not some rich frog!
<|emo_joy|> Ha ha ha. That was a good one
"<|emo_disgust|> Lmao That’s a blatant lie, ~1000 people were killed by American cops last year compared to 52 cops killed by civilians "
<|emo_joy|> He wasn’t drafted and is properly rated imo. Had a crazy career for sure. Beat the odds many times
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] did a YT vid and now everyone trying to be like him. Sad!
<|emo_anger|> I hated broccoli until my parents tapped into my obsession with dinosaurs and got me to pretend I was a brontosaurus
"<|emo_anger|> They stole my joke, damn them!"
<|emo_sad|> I don't feel alive anymore. I don't feel anything. I'm just numb all over. All I know is I want it to stop
<|emo_fear|> I know I've heard this phrase before but it's driving me crazy not remembering what it's from Please save me from my torment
<|emo_disgust|> Out of all the seasons I definitely feel the worst for her
<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry it happened like that for you. I really can't imagine.
<|emo_anger|> Here in America too. Those counter protesting fascist get thrown in jail and pepper sprayed like animals. It makes no sense that this happens.
<|emo_anger|> And then the rest of that thread devolves into [NAME] supporters arguing against and downvoting anyone who disagrees with the wall or hates [NAME].
"<|emo_joy|> Me too, but glad this creep is getting attention for his creepiness outside of r/kanye"
"<|emo_joy|> That's awesome. I never realized it was attributed to [NAME], though."
<|emo_joy|> That and customizable CSS makes me so happy. /r/Firefoxcss if you’re interested : )
<|emo_joy|> I once got flowers from a girl... idk why but it just feels good
"<|emo_disgust|> No sir, can’t hold them over a bowl for shit. Plus they make blunts taste weird."
<|emo_sad|> you're going to relapse in two years because you have an illness that makes you use excessive amounts of things to cope with emotions..
"<|emo_joy|> Amazing, I would also be deeply in love. So happy for you Hun. Enjoy every bit💕💕"
<|emo_anger|> I don't swallow toothpaste idiot
<|emo_disgust|> Are your boys really doing the hand clap meme? Holy crap is this cringey.
<|emo_anger|> But he is. He won’t talk to us. [NAME] damnit OP answer us!!
"<|emo_disgust|> Of course they do, feminists are self-absorbed pigs that just want to control everything and never be held accountable for anything."
<|emo_anger|> Stop giving this idiot attention.
"<|emo_joy|> Happy Birthday I hope this means anything, the little things matter sometimes."
"<|emo_anger|> so blame porn not the conditions that pushed them to use it as to the point of an ""addiction"" got it. "
<|emo_anger|> But don't you see it! How dare she show two inches of skin...
<|emo_surprise|> I had the same thought
<|emo_sad|> I made the mistake of choosing [NAME] once. I'm literaly unable to change characters in Tekken for the rest of my life.
<|emo_surprise|> Woooooooooo it took long enough but the UYU boys finally did it and made the league
<|emo_surprise|> Oh the irony in the title
<|emo_surprise|> Seriously? I have to work Monday. I can’t be thinking like that over the weekend.
<|emo_surprise|> Well this is the dumbest take I’ve seen on here.
"<|emo_anger|> Disgusting trash feminazis, fuck your hijab"
<|emo_anger|> What The actual fuck
<|emo_surprise|> WHY IS THERE WOMAN ON MY ENTERTAINMENT??????????
<|emo_anger|> You have no right to be there waiting to be nudged.
<|emo_anger|> I still hate Catcher Eggman!
<|emo_fear|> I'm working on it. But there is always the fear lurking around....
<|emo_anger|> What the fuck is The Baffler? I can't even go there at work.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh shit. You’re that bet welcher aren’t you?
<|emo_disgust|> Die mad about it.
<|emo_sad|> I really miss AG
<|emo_joy|> Congrats! How are you feeling about it?
"<|emo_joy|> On this blessed day, we are all KQLY."
"<|emo_joy|> Let the liar lie, it's more fun to watch."
<|emo_anger|> If she is an INFJ they can be quite caustic and verbally abusive at times.
<|emo_sad|> I miss when prequel memes was ironic
"<|emo_sad|> Im really sad, and there is alot more goin on but i dont know how to tell it."
<|emo_joy|> Awesome. Glad to hear it
<|emo_surprise|> I just had an overabundance of fudge. I took several pounds to my regular dispensary and they were thrilled.
<|emo_joy|> And the Reds. I subbed over at r/Reds after [NAME] went over there and their excitement at things actually happening fills me with envy
"<|emo_sad|> ""We're sorry, all circuits are busy now due [NAME] lost keys, try your call again"""
<|emo_fear|> That canopy looks like it could take someones head off.
"<|emo_fear|> Crap. Well, it's still horribly high on Vancouver Island... Wonderful."
<|emo_surprise|> Omg I thought you were paraphrasing. I'm so happy that those were the exact words they said.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME]... why you do this?
<|emo_sad|> PRERECORDED MESSAGE: I'm sorry. I'm no longer responding to messages on this thread. Please direct all further questions to your future parole officer.
"<|emo_sad|> This is like the third repost of this. But yes, very sad indeed."
<|emo_joy|> Tears of happiness rolls down the eyes
<|emo_sad|> Finding that common attraction or chemistry is extremely hard for me. I can totally relate to this.
<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. But I am proud of you for calling him out.
<|emo_joy|> I like The Office but this seems a bit weird.
<|emo_joy|> Dan cool and rich
<|emo_joy|> I enjoyed the 1:50 seconds of this person going about their day uneventfully
<|emo_joy|> It's always nice to tell someone a pleasant story before they go to sleep.
<|emo_joy|> Got a nice hairdoodoo
<|emo_joy|> I am pleased to report that my 5 win streak was broken.
"<|emo_joy|> Damn, but I’d miss my mother. Then again she’d be all happy in her heaven. The rest of us can party. "
<|emo_disgust|> And then in a weird twist her family tries him for murder. Haha!
<|emo_sad|> Oh man I feel bad now. If you find it funny than it's funny 💖 sorry
<|emo_disgust|> WHAT A DISGUSTING START
<|emo_anger|> Imagine being that much of a useless parasite
<|emo_disgust|> You gotta be a fucking idiot to use a regualr wooden pallet for a bale. Blue or Red pallets only
"<|emo_fear|> 6lbs is a lap dog, if someone shoots that cause they're scared it's aggressive..."
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] has been a pleasant surprise
<|emo_sad|> This is beautiful and heartbreaking :(
"<|emo_sad|> I can’t work, wish I could. Worked hard my whole life and lost literally everything a few years ago. 20 years down the drain."
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] fucked up with this line up. Why do you change it, if everything was going good? Idiot! "
<|emo_fear|> Well the cops would probably become even more corrupt in covering things up to protect their buddies from losing retirement
<|emo_sad|> that is the saddest damn yogurt ive ever seen
<|emo_joy|> Marlboro picked up [NAME] and are phasing out the njoys.
<|emo_disgust|> So [NAME] proved that they are not literally selling their workers into sex slavery. That's a pretty low bar!!
"<|emo_joy|> .5x speed. Every moment I enjoy would last longer and any time I find myself in a pickle, I'll have more time to react appropriately."
<|emo_surprise|> Wow! This got far more real than I was anticipating.
<|emo_joy|> I took a marijuana doobie this evening around 5:00 p.m. after my dinner at Country Kitchen Buffett and I am now tripping.
<|emo_joy|> They all clapped.
<|emo_surprise|> Imagine my shock... but he does seem very representative of the left.
<|emo_joy|> Good luck and congratulations! You are not your diagnosis 😁
"<|emo_surprise|> No, it's the curds, they just feel really strange in my mouth."
<|emo_disgust|> It sounds spasticated.
<|emo_joy|> [NAME]. What a time to be alive.
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]. I didn't think weapon durability would be a problem for me in BotW but I kind of grew an emotional attachment to that 2h battle axe...
<|emo_disgust|> And if that's the case then there is no helping him. It sucks that those people can't be helped
<|emo_sad|> THIS MADE ME CRY
"<|emo_joy|> I’ll be honest I really don’t care. I’m happy to know that others care about this, but eh you do you"
<|emo_disgust|> I saw the video. It was more awkward than anything.
<|emo_sad|> Then it'll hurt more when I kick it in the balls.
<|emo_fear|> >But a leader who strikes fear Like when people were worried [NAME] might murder them?
"<|emo_disgust|> Then there you have it. From everything I have seen thus far, this game is doomed. I hate saying that."
"<|emo_anger|> Do as I say, Not as I do"
<|emo_sad|> Yep happening to me all the time at my college. Fuck everything
<|emo_surprise|> Wouldn't that be wonderful. You might be interested in this report on the divergence productivity and worker
"<|emo_joy|> She loves to scream ""[NAME]"" during anal."
<|emo_joy|> I look fine af 😜 and yourself?
"<|emo_disgust|> Oh that's disgusting, this man should be sent to priso- ohh, it's America, ok then, feel free. "
<|emo_anger|> I am really intrigued why you worded the title this way.
"<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if it's a deal issue and they are allowed, again, to slip away in the last minute."
<|emo_joy|> Too obsessed. The only other author I read is [NAME]. Now I post on sports subs too
<|emo_surprise|> This makes me wonder if they fixed [NAME] having a very noticeable gap between her body and legs with her new shorts.
<|emo_disgust|> What a horseshit response
"<|emo_disgust|> Every time I get a staff kill, it feels like seeing a shooting star <3 Yeah, it definitely sucks."
<|emo_disgust|> ssssssssssssssshhhhhhhhhhhh just give this one to me it's been a weird day
<|emo_fear|> A is just horrifying. If she were to die I’d want her to go painlessly
"<|emo_anger|> Damn, even here in CA the gun haters almost invariably exempt law enforcement from their crusade."
<|emo_surprise|> Wowowowow!!!! I’ve been campaigning for [NAME] too!
<|emo_joy|> EXACTLY. It literally blows my mind that 45 minutes from me it’s completely legal but here it’s jail time like...ok.
"<|emo_disgust|> No foreplay, no connection, if he doesn't know what he's doing. If he asks for a blow job and then refuses to reciprocate. "
<|emo_surprise|> Wow really? I would think that UK bases would be the last place we'd have protests at.
"<|emo_joy|> Haha thanks, I'm not cool at all but that comment made my day! Genuinely made me smile. <3"
<|emo_fear|> *losing hope Loose is what your mom is
<|emo_sad|> RIP manning lol
<|emo_disgust|> This is my fiancé and I hate it
<|emo_fear|> That’s a terrible amount of bp for 11 kills
<|emo_anger|> This article is stupid.
"<|emo_sad|> True, and so sad to see. Somewhere along the way, the governing of a country my mutual consensus turned into a national sport with 2 teams."
<|emo_surprise|> I wondered where the quote about “supporting your azz” and was very pleased to finally find the train wreck that said it.
<|emo_surprise|> I always wondered where it was on ormond. I managed to find the toolbox last week on yamaoka as killer.
"<|emo_anger|> Man, she took it pretty well. I’d be screaming my damn head off. "
<|emo_disgust|> When I was younger I would forget to pull it back to pee sometimes. That was a mess and led to some embarrassing moments.
"<|emo_sad|> When will [NAME] learn that recycling his old favorite beliefs and takes from 2008, will not end or age well. "
"<|emo_disgust|> that's a weird way to spell ""prison"""
<|emo_disgust|> Soon: Mass death of pink-skinned Aussies.
<|emo_anger|> So. Fucking. Tone. Deaf.
<|emo_sad|> I used to do the same exact thing! Now I love the fat on my steak and watching them cut it off in japanese restaurants makes me sad.
<|emo_sad|> Plymouth: Confederate flags Diesel pick up trucks Dead factories Heart disease and disappointment
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry pal, it’s actually one of my least favorites :/"
"<|emo_joy|> I am happy to receive constructive advice. If someone is short, or not constructive, I will react to it."
<|emo_anger|> Any food shortages will be caused by these idiots each buying 38 tins of beans a few days before we leave.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] a fucking idiot and needs to be primaried out.
<|emo_sad|> I cringed and flinched. That’s a bad day
<|emo_sad|> I feel shot in the heart.
<|emo_fear|> Goosebumps had the same take on those too. Those books used to scare the shit out of me
"<|emo_sad|> Brother, I am in tears, [NAME], I wish I had been there. "
<|emo_sad|> I cheered for the Superbowl to be canceled
"<|emo_disgust|> You're being a total narc, bro. You're so narcoleptic."
"<|emo_joy|> Cheers, I enjoyed your announcers. Sucks we don't get to play again until next year"
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, hate that. "
<|emo_anger|> bournemouth v chelsea took under 3.5 3-0 then in the 95th minute bournemouth grab another. feels bad man
<|emo_sad|> What a waste of money and time
<|emo_anger|> Holy shit. Those guys are scumbags. I'm so sorry you had to go through such an awful roleplay.
"<|emo_disgust|> Blame [RELIGION] communities where it's normalised for men to divorce women without giving her any of her rights , even Islamically. "
<|emo_sad|> How is it racist? I fail to see how.
<|emo_sad|> Forgive me for being so forward but you’re hot af
<|emo_fear|> This is scary.
<|emo_disgust|> It’s ugly. Bye bye and good riddance.
<|emo_surprise|> i didn't knew your toe can get that flat without breaking the nail in thousand of pieces
<|emo_disgust|> It was deloitte wasn't it. That is some bullshit application.
"<|emo_joy|> Lol. I'm gonna try this with my wife. As I always have to tell myself: ""Don't 'should' on yourself."""
<|emo_joy|> I absolutely love that idea. I went on an anniversary trip with a couple once and it was amazing! We had so much fun.
"<|emo_sad|> But something is extremely wrong if people are getting sick. Might not be a sonic wave, but it definitely is *something*"
<|emo_anger|> Dude wtf that was definitely off Brooklyn
<|emo_anger|> Bloody Peasant!
<|emo_disgust|> Turkey bacon is some worst processed food. Enjoy
<|emo_surprise|> I’m wondering about those friends of hers that encouraged her to contact you..
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] voice actor by the end of the game was phenomenal. So much rage and sadness
<|emo_fear|> I wonder if losing their majority in the 2019 locals would shift the Unionist parties’ position?
<|emo_anger|> This is so cruel. I literally feel physically sick.
<|emo_anger|> Hot take: [NAME] sucked after he went away to anger management and he suddenly changed into a moron who was completely incapable of doing anything even remotely correct.
<|emo_fear|> I feel so bad for [NAME]. It was probably hard to concentrate on this match with the things going on in his personal life
"<|emo_surprise|> Well, I bought cheese when I went, and was shocked at the great variety and lower prices. That probably skewed my view."
<|emo_sad|> How many gallons do we need is my favorite so far. The sad part is that it was always pleasant.
<|emo_joy|> Cancel as soon as you can it’s far more enjoyable!!!!
<|emo_joy|> Didn’t the chinook end? How are her legs not freezing off?!
<|emo_anger|> Looks like a plate to me. A stupid plate. But a plate nonetheless.
<|emo_joy|> NICO WITH THE SMIRK!
<|emo_sad|> I’m sorry. It was nothing to be angry about
<|emo_sad|> I feel like people who post these are too in denial to realize it looks like a cry for help
"<|emo_fear|> I know. Maybe if they realize this, they'll stop using that app."
"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah I'll probably do some baking with it! I might also like it better after a while, I was just very surprised today 😂"
<|emo_surprise|> How did I miss that?
<|emo_sad|> I'm so sorry
<|emo_surprise|> I'm with you. Would this news surprise me? Absolutely not. But I'm not believing anything regarding this subject unless it comes from [NAME] himself
<|emo_joy|> Glad you're at least out of bed. Progress!
<|emo_surprise|> This again?
<|emo_surprise|> Alarming! 🥀🥀🥀 🚓🍩🚓🍩🚓
<|emo_sad|> That is an exceedingly rare failure. I read an article about this guy. He was just stupid and stopped there.
<|emo_fear|> I was 10 years old when this happened and seeing her heartbroken dad on tv and hearing her story still haunts me.
"<|emo_sad|> I feel bad for house slaves, even if it's in their understandable self-interest. "

<|emo_anger|> Don’t you spit facts! Downvote for you (everyone) with no reply. They don’t reply to good arguments just downvote you.
<|emo_surprise|> One more reason for us to have our own space program.
<|emo_surprise|> I thought you only get to be a wizard after you're 30yo and still virgin
"<|emo_disgust|> >""Fuck it Im on my way out anyway"" ""Fuck it Im on my way out to Seattle"""
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you’re so generous with other people’s money."
<|emo_surprise|> Your amazing too!
"<|emo_surprise|> Hi, [NAME]! I am stopping by to wish you the best day, and the best year! -HappyFriendlyBot"
<|emo_anger|> Yeah no one is gonna do that and get reported to HR for bigotry.
<|emo_joy|> No I know. This group has been mostly helpful. And the rude comments were deleted by the mods.
<|emo_sad|> Sadly this story has died down why is he bringing it back up. Just let it die.
<|emo_sad|> This is scary and so very sad. Eleven??? A baby! I was still building forts. I weep for this child.
<|emo_joy|> Oh cool it’s another episode where lefties forget about consent
<|emo_joy|> Thank you. People always forget that The Happiest Days of Our Lives is essentially part of that song.
<|emo_anger|> DELETE THAT SCREEN SHOT! NOW!!!
<|emo_surprise|> Shocking description of the criminals. Never could have guessed that
<|emo_anger|> What are you listening to?
<|emo_sad|> I feel your pain...
"<|emo_fear|> Not only do they make me cringe, I become angry because usually or is my nmother and her flying monkey daughter posting them. Just horrible."
<|emo_surprise|> I used to build a ramp and jump over other kids on my bike ala [NAME]... I was amazed at the time.
<|emo_fear|> Devastating and true.
<|emo_sad|> A 20% win percentage really sneaks up on ya :( no wonder this sub has to have a toxicity talk lmfao
<|emo_fear|> The only cringe is some of y'all obsessing over every little thing Eureka does.
<|emo_sad|> Hahah. I wish I could say that’ll get less painful with time but it won’t. Sorry my dude. F
"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, 14 year olds in 2019 are bigger shits than I was when I was 14."
<|emo_fear|> Terrifyingly accurate bot
<|emo_joy|> that sounds absolutely adorable!! im glad you had those kittens there as a distraction :)
<|emo_anger|> Bitch subscribed to 1st look at [NAME] shitposts.
<|emo_joy|> I sort of did lol. I think what I mean is that you cant look at it as an alternative to rdp
<|emo_disgust|> I too cuddle with this guy’s sister in law if his wife is tired
<|emo_fear|> malicious intentions? what are you talking about?
"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, im on hype."
"<|emo_joy|> Haha! Toronto, the hotbed of conservatism."
"<|emo_joy|> Am I the only one who is glad I saw this meme? I mean I'm officially traumatized, but still."
"<|emo_sad|> You're clearly upset tho, you're not doing a good job proving your lack of caring"
"<|emo_sad|> Man, this analogy is frighteningly spot on. Makes me sad for the province."
<|emo_anger|> This country is an absolute shithole. Our police are no better than the filth they should be catching!
<|emo_sad|> Sounds painful man
<|emo_joy|> Going to jump sides 2nd half lol
"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, did they innovate anything I would recognize with their obscenely large financial investments? :):):):)"
<|emo_fear|> Putting your finger and a loose cloth inside the 3 jaw chuck to polish the inside is insanely dangerous
<|emo_anger|> Could listen to it coz everyone talking.. not a bad thing coz the dude in the do rag was whack as fuck.
<|emo_joy|> Well I'm glad I decided to go to McD's instead of doing those lines!
<|emo_disgust|> It’s a cruel thing to say to someone with depression.
<|emo_disgust|> Putting them away feels so good it’s worth the frustration. Snipers dropped my career KD by like .15 >__<
<|emo_disgust|> Hate people like this
<|emo_sad|> Sorry you are having such trouble.
<|emo_sad|> I feel so bad anytime I see anyone fall on their face... I just want to make sure they are ok.
<|emo_sad|> Guilty :( I was ready to cry and everything >:(
<|emo_anger|> cause he constantly hates on [NAME] for no reason other than Petry having the puck on his stick more than anyone else on the team
<|emo_sad|> I think that had to do more with not wanting to hurt the old man lol
"<|emo_joy|> I’m a hitman. Joke. I’m a forensic science student. Really enjoy my course, but I’m changing to biomedicine. "
<|emo_anger|> because energy drinks are the most fucked up you can get while still being sober
<|emo_disgust|> You are disgusting.
<|emo_joy|> I tried so hard.... I got too far....
<|emo_disgust|> I used to do shit like this...back when I had a serious drinking problem I was in denial about
<|emo_anger|> I hate when people Beijing a gun. Even worse when they Shanghai one.
<|emo_anger|> You die.
<|emo_surprise|> Delusion at its finest
<|emo_joy|> Haha! I remember seeing this when it aired
<|emo_fear|> Right :-) The rookie was so scared to show his hand and he thought his two pairs weren’t good and thought he had lost.
"<|emo_disgust|> Both good and not so good, but mostly good! You should DESTROY HER. NOBODY NEEDS TO TAKE UP THAT MUCH SPACE ON THE CURB. "
<|emo_surprise|> Thank you! I am surprised with the amount of feedback I am getting. I was not careful with my word choice.
<|emo_joy|> So happy for you both!
"<|emo_sad|> They are having a whole bunch of problems , maybe they are paying so the state doesn't go after them as well."
"<|emo_surprise|> Guys, even worse: He *paid* someone to set it up. Wow. "
<|emo_disgust|> This is unironically the worst trade I've ever seen.
"<|emo_joy|> ...it was a corgi, and that dog looked happy as hell."
<|emo_joy|> I knew a guy named [NAME]. Always wondered what his middle name was.
"<|emo_joy|> Klokslag 12 I find really enjoyable, horror movie podcast, Im not a horror fan but I find these dudes very entertaining"
<|emo_joy|> That's awesome. Hahaha
<|emo_disgust|> TYT is a gossip shitpost panel for race baiting idiots. By race baiting idiots.
<|emo_joy|> I like how you ignored the point about Blade Runner.
<|emo_anger|> #CHECK THAT TRIPLE
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] damnit, have your upvote "
<|emo_joy|> This seems like a massive cope. But do whatever makes you happy.
"<|emo_anger|> You are the type of fellow that puts mommy in the cheap home and cashes her cheques, loyalty of a snake."
<|emo_disgust|> Pulisic is a replacement for our abysmal right wing.
<|emo_fear|> Stuff like this makes me worry a little less about the future generations.
"<|emo_fear|> Get it out of the way as quickly as possible. Some people claim to like it, so maybe you'll be one of those weirdos."
<|emo_joy|> Absolutely terrible. But wholesome aswell.
"<|emo_sad|> It's been deleted, we can't even see what it was now (unfortunately). "
"<|emo_anger|> [RELIGION] is what produces these people, there are plenty of them and a beheading has even occured in the streets of LONDON."
<|emo_anger|> Because majority of moves have stupidly long names. GO INTO ANGEL PUNISHER INTO DIVE BOMB RADIANCE AND FINISH THE JOB WITH PUNISHING LIGHT BLADE
<|emo_sad|> I thought it was mildly interesting and don't regret watching it.
"<|emo_anger|> WHY THE FUCK IS WES ON THE FLOOR, HE CANT DEFEND SHIT"
<|emo_joy|> Would love to see them both in the same side
"<|emo_fear|> Ahhh, I see. I thought you were saying they made you afraid of the sessions."
"<|emo_surprise|> ""*[NAME], what's your favourite 80s band?*"" ""*New ORDERRRR!*"""
<|emo_fear|> terrifying every time.
<|emo_joy|> I can't not pick Savor the Flavor when playing Stitches though. It's just too damn fun.
<|emo_disgust|> Another rich person to hired for him to be killed.
<|emo_surprise|> yes!! i was like oh my god. oh my [NAME]. it’s gone. the weight’s GONE. i’m FREE!

<|emo_anger|> YEAH! How dare he ask if you were feeling ok!!!
"<|emo_anger|> People who WANT a border wall: idiots, racists."
<|emo_joy|> Ducks just happy. Hadn’t had a shit for days
<|emo_joy|> Glad we got that criminal off the streets! No-good [NAME]. Tsk tsk
"<|emo_joy|> ""Sponge Blurb Pubs Quaw Haha GURR ha AAa!"" finale is too real"
<|emo_fear|> The faces in that drawing are kinda horrifying
<|emo_joy|> I enjoyed the effort from your dad so I must downvote but I want the subreddit to see this so I’ll upvote
<|emo_sad|> I can do that too but I have diarrhea
"<|emo_sad|> Its horrifying to think about getting separated from your family, friends and the culture you were living into somewhere new and unfamiliar just like that"
<|emo_disgust|> To me the toenails is the grossest part! 🤮
<|emo_surprise|> Our o-line was great outside of 2 games this year. My [NAME] did you even watch or pay attention to this team this year?
<|emo_anger|> How dare you make an attempt to be kind!
"<|emo_disgust|> Hold my wine, I have to go vomit in sorrow. "
<|emo_fear|> It really sucks people are downvoting you just because they were worried about blowing themselves up just like us nova bomb users.
<|emo_anger|> Yeah how dare the puck not magnetize to [NAME] stick. Not his fault at all.
<|emo_joy|> I really like the AussieBum jockstraps.
<|emo_sad|> This spoke to my soul. I might cry 😭. I really do run away from my feelings
<|emo_surprise|> I've never been there before so I can't confirm or deny but I would be really surprised if a casino only had limit holdem
<|emo_joy|> I feel that way about [NAME] antis saying [NAME] and [NAME] antis saying [NAME]. But I’m also terrible and laugh every time I see it.
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah well you’re a horrible [NAME]
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] that was so stupid lol holy fuck wat
<|emo_surprise|> Wow! That's awesome! Congratulations! Its wonderful to have hope of being off medications one day.
<|emo_sad|> Shit's going down in Zim. 6 people killed yesterday by army and over 200 arrested.
"<|emo_sad|> yeah, they both suck... i am not a customer of either, and never will be again."
<|emo_joy|> Les Collines (Never Leave You) is still a bop. I loved that song and is still awesome in 2019.
<|emo_anger|> It makes sense to me. I am a republican in that sense but hate the GOP for the most part.
<|emo_anger|> that's why im here in the overwatch university subreddit you fucking idiot.
<|emo_sad|> This guy gets it (and feels it as well... Sorry brother)
"<|emo_surprise|> forget new buildings, i work at the chase plaza building and am a little bummed that seagram tower made it but this didnt."
<|emo_surprise|> Wow... Mid 2000's this would of been a way better follow up to Space Jam and probably just as if not more popular.
<|emo_joy|> Maybe they are jealous that you found happiness.
<|emo_joy|> King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard and Beach House are my two favourite bands.
<|emo_disgust|> I actually had to rewind a few times because I found myself getting distracted because I was kind of bored.
"<|emo_joy|> Picturing you sneezing and banging your head made me laugh so hard! THAT'S WHAT YOU GET! Now, pipe down."
<|emo_joy|> What a time to be alive.
"<|emo_sad|> Uh, sorry. We're under trumpcare now."
<|emo_joy|> Yesterday I remembered that this game existed and was happy that I waited and didn't buy into a game that would be dead in a month.
<|emo_anger|> Really? I thought he hated Mou.
<|emo_disgust|> Finishing peeing and then still feeling like you have to pee.
<|emo_joy|> I live for this comment 🙌🏻 i just thought it was me getting older and losing touch with whats “trendy” but am glad its equally hated
<|emo_disgust|> It’s like you didn’t even read the comment you’re responding to.
"<|emo_disgust|> Believe you me. TLJ is much, much worse."
<|emo_anger|> I CANNOT WITH THESE COMMERCIALS
<|emo_fear|> Yes. I often dream of death or further isolation
<|emo_surprise|> This looks so damn cool! I’d love a shirt like this!
<|emo_surprise|> Wow. So I figure you two are both at least considerably older than me (24) and ...wow his response
"<|emo_sad|> I'm having the same problem. Hoping that there is some good advice in response to this! Hugs though hon, I feel your pain."
"<|emo_anger|> Seriously, check his food. It is upsetting his stomach."
<|emo_joy|> I just told myself I wasn't going to check this subreddit until I'd beaten the episode. And I didn't.
"<|emo_sad|> [NAME], feel bad for that streamer, everyone has their moments on this game, it’s understandable"
<|emo_disgust|> The worst is working with dealerships
<|emo_disgust|> Not ok. They could have easily given them a drug test if they really wanted to know if they were on drugs. Disgusting.
<|emo_sad|> trailer fabulous!!! i miss it
"<|emo_anger|> The ""[NAME] says it's true"" line makes me think he's messing with you."
<|emo_joy|> So he is half decent. Glad to see your finally making some sense.
<|emo_anger|> 11 years goddamit I’m old
<|emo_joy|> What a great photo and you two look so happy. 😍
<|emo_anger|> Your kind honestly need to fuck off out of Ireland. Nobody wants your dumb fucking antisemitism here
<|emo_sad|> He most likely saw you and just didn’t care. Sadly.
"<|emo_disgust|> >It would also open the possibility of selling the [NAME] arms, I guess. That would be a terrible idea."
"<|emo_joy|> take up english sometime, you might enjoy it."
<|emo_fear|> He is like a bad cartoon that’s hard to turn off.
"<|emo_disgust|> What an ugly shade [NAME] used to dye his hair. Well, I guess it matches the infamous shirt."
<|emo_disgust|> Fcking disgusting.
<|emo_sad|> They literally don’t have enough time on the planet to regret their actions.
"<|emo_sad|> Man, I kinda feel bad for dude, hopefully everything went smoothly past that"
<|emo_sad|> I agree!!! His character has grown so much throughout the entire series and I was very disappointed that he ended up with her.
"<|emo_sad|> This is me all the time, a mixture of anxiety and dread."
<|emo_sad|> I feel personally attacked.
<|emo_sad|> So sorry for your loss! I lost my cat 6 years ago in 2021 due to terminal autism. 😭😭
<|emo_sad|> Re-educated her is more like it. I feel so bad for her. Internally she must be a mess. I suspect she will change her stance again.
"<|emo_joy|> It's better with sound, when I first watched it I cried laughing for 10 mins"
<|emo_anger|> What the hell
"<|emo_sad|> Meanwhile, 1500 a day continue to die from cigarettes"
"<|emo_anger|> Honestly, fuck [NAME] after the bounty gate shit"
<|emo_anger|> Men are the worst.
<|emo_anger|> Now this REALLY sucks
<|emo_anger|> His definition of a grown man is someone who drinks irresponsibly and then beats people up. GET OUT.
<|emo_sad|> No problem! I was upset I couldn’t chose a female rose grey bay Arabian in story mode. I wanted to name her Rosé
<|emo_sad|> Because the dude was fuuuuucked up.
<|emo_surprise|> Surprised he's in. Imagined he was concussed. He was on another planet for a bit.
"<|emo_disgust|> I am truly sorry for you because that ""song"" is so awful"
"<|emo_joy|> I binged that podcast in about 2 days at work. Amazing. The convention for Limelight, and how emotional they got for those poor women was heartbreaking."
<|emo_sad|> I hope Dallas gets close and loses in heartbreak.
<|emo_disgust|> My husband never watches this show. Watching with me: “[NAME] is a horrible dad. He looks likes he hammered. He’s so greasy”
<|emo_surprise|> Am I the only one who thinks these Instagram poses girls do are so freaking cheesy
<|emo_disgust|> She’s a disgusting snob.. Feel bad for the workers. :(
<|emo_sad|> You're not my real mom. I don't have to listen to you. Just because my dad loves you doesn't mean that I have to!
<|emo_surprise|> Sometimes I wonder if people are that stupid or that malicious
<|emo_anger|> Whaaaaaaat the heck was that?
<|emo_anger|> I mean... this is some shit right here
"<|emo_disgust|> Got one, it's still bad dude"
<|emo_anger|> Who needs sciences. It's most fake news they peddle in anyways...
<|emo_joy|> Great news. Thanks for sharing Crunk! Donated...
<|emo_sad|> Lmao I have like 12 days played cop farming who even does that anymore oh my [NAME] you’re pathetic for even bringing up ages

<|emo_sad|> Aquaria just lost her shit when the Cup Toss challenge went awry
<|emo_sad|> I have a bad feeling I’m gonna regret not tuning into this
<|emo_fear|> Still my nightmare aged 34....
<|emo_disgust|> That's the worst possible outcome
"<|emo_sad|> Definitely. I cried. A lot. But if [NAME] existence has taught me anything, it’s to hold out hope! "
"<|emo_joy|> Hey quick brag, this post was read by [NAME], episode 63! I'm actually really excited, he's one of my favorites."
<|emo_sad|> I mean she’s barely into college so she’s only maybe 18-20 but to be this oblivious is pretty sad.
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] is cheaper too. If we would have kept [NAME] we would have had to extend him to over $4mil.
<|emo_fear|> That’s what I’m terrified of.
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, grilled nuggets. Haven't really seen those at fast food places so I thought they were just the regular nuggets"
<|emo_disgust|> You spend most of your time here in the Rangers threads talking about how much you hate the huns. That's pretty weird as well.
"<|emo_sad|> I hope you’re doing well with RCIA! So sorry for your loss. Praying for you, your family, and your daughter ♥️"
<|emo_surprise|> Woah nice. Did you enjoy it or was it a completionist pain? I wish I could get into [NAME] but I just dont find the fun.
<|emo_surprise|> I've always found it weird how popular Nandos is in Britain.
<|emo_anger|> I'm so happy he rolled his car. Assholes are destroying the natural environment with their bullshit cars
<|emo_disgust|> > traffic through there in the summer is awful because that’s where everyone wants to be. your life starts to revolve around bridge time.
<|emo_joy|> Serving us Ornacia!!! Honestly though I love this look!
"<|emo_fear|> Sometimes I think it's like the movie *Shallow Hal*. You see the person for who they really are on the inside, and it's terrifying."
"<|emo_fear|> This was the one post that truly frightened me about the insane left. They are a cult, and not on our side."
"<|emo_surprise|> Bro, put water in the microwave and see what happens, we're like 70% that shit"
<|emo_anger|> This isn’t a “someone” this is a company.
<|emo_anger|> How stupid of [NAME] to rely on LibDems to stop the idea of referendum.
"<|emo_fear|> they sounds like autistic meltdowns triggered by an immense fear of vomiting, nothing much to do"
"<|emo_fear|> Wow, the Wizards are horrible "
<|emo_joy|> I have a religious friend who i agreed with early on that we could make fun of each other's beliefs/lack of. We're still best friends :)
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] these things were terrible. i presume they still are. #teamlemoncreams
<|emo_sad|> Mom-emotions are always heartwarming and honest but dad-emotions make me tear up. Fuck
<|emo_joy|> Merrily merrily merrily merrily something something scream... (I am not creative)
"<|emo_disgust|> I’m sorry to inform you, it’s worse. "
"<|emo_anger|> Is it cruel to give your kids medicine when they don’t know what it is and why, if they need it?"
<|emo_anger|> I hate fags
<|emo_joy|> Umm... I am.
<|emo_sad|> poor mod :( i guess people arent allowed to leave this sub if they are vegan
<|emo_disgust|> Same! I don’t know how our elementary level colleagues do it. When I subbed in elementary a few times it was awful.
"<|emo_surprise|> Noooo. I seriously did not know that. Yes, mind blown. "
<|emo_fear|> Is that were its from ? All i know is since i was young that is scary af !
<|emo_anger|> Fair enough. But he’d basically become an off tank with all that healing lol. I already get raped by reaper enough (tank main)
"<|emo_disgust|> The truly great thing about this is how he looks down, disgusted, as if the comment were down there 😂"
<|emo_anger|> Sports are fucking garbage. Basically just religion but with jerseys and beer in public.
<|emo_anger|> This is disgusting. *secretly gets horny* I've had it with this sub. *opens new incognito tab*
<|emo_joy|> Gotta love Alabama School Fundraisers. You know that dad paid big bucks with how excited he is

"<|emo_disgust|> You’re right, republicans are worse because they have nukes."
<|emo_anger|> Utter nonsense from yourself.
<|emo_fear|> So. This is scary as fuck.
<|emo_sad|> Alllllllways. Losing that toonie makes you feel like a rookie every time.
<|emo_joy|> Peace to you both.
<|emo_surprise|> Now this is oddly specific
"<|emo_anger|> Everything is political, bub. "
<|emo_anger|> That shit sent me on a fucking journey to read.
"<|emo_sad|> Not an unattractive man, he’s gonna need real plastic surgery to fix that. "
<|emo_sad|> We are very clumsy creatures. Eventually you just learn to laugh it off. *The crying comes later when no one is around*
<|emo_sad|> Stop attacking me
<|emo_disgust|> It happens way more than you think. People are repulsive.
<|emo_fear|> I'm also a human being but I can't think of any reason why I would physically hurt a woman.
<|emo_anger|> If she canf even protect herself what the fuck is she doing in a business that protects others.
<|emo_joy|> I'm also enjoying it I like mixing the colors the most.
<|emo_joy|> I dunno if that's really a HMB moment but funny nonetheless.
"<|emo_anger|> Rip time wasted editing, its a shame that not many other people saw this"
<|emo_anger|> Not this sub’s fault the ((([NAME]))) is full of idiots
<|emo_joy|> I’m so happy for them. I hope he drowns in a puddle of bacon grease.
<|emo_fear|> There's doing stupid things when you're young. Then there's doing horribly stupid things when you're in your mid-30s and you're already active in Politics
"<|emo_joy|> And it seems, just genuinely nice, hilarious, and passionate about her work. I hope she gets more of an edit from now on!"
"<|emo_joy|> ""Yeeaah, I know you're homeless and all but apartments are actually really boring. My most beautiful memories were all made outside in nature."""

<|emo_joy|> IM ALL JACKED UP ON MOUNTAIN DEW
<|emo_joy|> Or at least a couple more visits to the booth. I enjoyed hearing him adding to the banter.
<|emo_joy|> Delete this. Half the fun is spending five minutes convincing someone to get down on the floor and look through a couple holes.
"<|emo_fear|> I understand that there are issues. However, if someone chose to stay away from Perth due to the violent behaviour then where would they go on holiday?"
<|emo_fear|> I would be afraid he would come back and somehow blame me for his failure.
<|emo_joy|> Haha I can imagine! Good on you for doing it though.
<|emo_joy|> This made me incredibly happy and incredibly sad. Sometimes this universe robs us of the wrong people.
"<|emo_sad|> Unfortunately, I don't. Sorry. 😔"
<|emo_anger|> But what if that's the only job I would enjoy?
"<|emo_sad|> > They are all one entity with the same goals. Agreed, sadly."
<|emo_joy|> I honestly believe that being a Saudi woman should automatically qualify you for refugee status.
"<|emo_disgust|> Then they're the worst fascists of all time, because their critics have been extremely loud and public, while not being murdered."
<|emo_anger|> Duuuude you are double trouble! It's you're* cmon man have some mercy on yourself
"<|emo_joy|> I kept reading and apparently he was able to pull out 10k to his bank account, so he currently has doubled his money"

"<|emo_joy|> Amazing, I would also be deeply in love. So happy for you Hun. Enjoy every bit💕💕"
"<|emo_anger|> Plot twist: she didn’t turn on any water, just pissed in their hands "
<|emo_surprise|> That's still crazy to me as it's the same price online and in store here. We just have a flat rate.

<|emo_surprise|> fuck off. let people enjoy what they want to enjoy when it doesn't impact you.
<|emo_sad|> Will that's what that poor child was just taught. Some parents have no idea

<|emo_surprise|> Omg so short but such a bop! I’m so excited for her album
<|emo_sad|> you are pathetic.
<|emo_disgust|> Just don't call me late for dinner.
"<|emo_joy|> I didn't realize CPO was an add-on available, I just saw their advertising. Thanks!"
<|emo_sad|> It is though. Certainly the worst Zelda game at least.
"<|emo_anger|> No one ever laid on their death bed and said, “I regret not working even harder.”"
<|emo_surprise|> Fuck I’m sitting in position 3 right now
<|emo_surprise|> Break up? Lol you lost me right there. I thought you were a rational dude until the mourning your “break up”. Decent troll 6/10
<|emo_sad|> People back then just might have had a bad memory and kept forgetting about it.
<|emo_joy|> That’s so romantic!
"<|emo_sad|> It's not like the picture looks bad. Wait, no, I take that back immediately. I can't unsee it now too."
"<|emo_fear|> I feel terrible but I do this too, or watch obese people doing mukbangs"
<|emo_sad|> I'm 21. I've entered adulthood and I even have to face negative comments from family members. Adulthood won't save me.

<|emo_anger|> Super Bowls are overrated anyways. s. I'm more angry about back-to-back seasons ending on a fade to Crabtree in the endzone.
"<|emo_disgust|> Man, and I thought the princess and the toad was an odd story"
<|emo_fear|> It’s such a horrible argument I’m shocked they still use it.
<|emo_fear|> Kinda weird after you find out he wrote those songs while thinking about underage girls.
"<|emo_sad|> I'm at job that is effecting my mental health, and I'm not sure if I should be up front."
<|emo_sad|> I heard the ostrich was sick.
<|emo_anger|> So we not gonna talk about that zone spam 😂
<|emo_surprise|> Oh! I didn't realize they were also vegan.
"<|emo_anger|> I was quoting him. He wanted an ""outsider rich business type"", piss off"
<|emo_sad|> Your life must be miserable. That's sad somehow
"<|emo_sad|> I stand corrected, my apologies to the mods. I'd personally like to see more banned or removed but at least they handled the most egregious."
<|emo_fear|> This was potentially the most dangerous stunt I have ever seen someone do. One minor mistake and you die.
"<|emo_anger|> If an addict gets clean of booze/drugs, you congratulate them! What a horrible crabbycrab to try to shut down someone who got their addiction under control."
"<|emo_sad|> Grandmother got into an accident many years ago, and walked away with broken ribs.... it took her a couple years before she found out"
"<|emo_sad|> yeah, I've had the hardest time letting go of my exes. The last straw was when I found out they cheated."
"<|emo_surprise|> After they put the bullet in it I wouldn't be surprised if it got scaled back even further, considering just how much of the community up and bailed"
"<|emo_joy|> Ok I get that, like I said, different morals for different people. I was just curious how you got gender issues out of that"
"<|emo_joy|> My fav frank songs are white Ferrari, super rich kids and bad religion, I know those are popular songs I just wanna get deeper into his music "
<|emo_joy|> I live downtown and walk around at odd hours of the night all the time. Love the empty and abandoned feel of the city.
<|emo_anger|> I hate those days man... So triggering
<|emo_disgust|> That ET one looks like he has stuck his finger is some strawberry jello or something and is disgusted that some has stuck to his finger!
"<|emo_sad|> No, I'm saying they are equally critical."
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah because what we should do is continue to be an absolute embarrassment.
"<|emo_anger|> I mean I'm mad at him for posting that, but that's just because I'm jealous of that P7"
<|emo_anger|> An angry old person yelling at a retail worker will never listen to reason.
"<|emo_joy|> I don’t know her, I just thought it was funny how the titles of that post and the post under it went so well together. "
<|emo_anger|> #**i have decided that i want to die**
<|emo_anger|> downvoting for reupload please stop this nobody likes it
"<|emo_surprise|> I know, I know, but CAN YOU BLAME ME FOR BEING NERVOUS"
<|emo_anger|> You cant pick and choose racism you dippy cunt
<|emo_disgust|> I didn't think it was that bad ><
<|emo_joy|> Sooooo happy for you.
"<|emo_disgust|> Japan edging out Canada? WTF? There's some bullshit going on there, man. And what rocketed Switzerland from obscurity to the top of the mountain in 2017?"
<|emo_surprise|> Wow I typed that out before my eyes were awake 👀
<|emo_anger|> This post fucking sucks because it doesn't cater to my beliefs.
"<|emo_joy|> Which totally makes it less funny for a person like me who has never seen this before, and laughed. "
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was such a nasty POS. In his dirty wifebeaters with his malt liquor. “Men have needs...” He disgusts me.
<|emo_joy|> > Iturriaga (Mexico) Oh yeah. that was a thing. How was we?
<|emo_anger|> The sea was angry that day my friends...
<|emo_surprise|> Wow thanks. Didn’t know there were any others glad to hear
"<|emo_sad|> What’s weird is. I never miss anyone. Like, ever."
"<|emo_sad|> Same, I'm really struggling to not become feminine because of that."
"<|emo_joy|> Yep, especially if the mob on reddit is any indication of the group-think that’s going on in 2019."
<|emo_sad|> I believe it was a severe dislocation as opposed to a fracture. Regardless....poor guy....
<|emo_fear|> Hard. Social anxiety/general fear/uggoness kept me from actually getting dates and i was extremely awkward when I finally stopped anxie-puking to actually go on the date.
"<|emo_surprise|> Really? Edit: Ah yea, I saw the original one. It still reminds me of Wind Maker."
<|emo_joy|> FaceTime with wifey!! Happy anniversary!
<|emo_sad|> You miss the sidewalk wing massacres as well I'd bet
"<|emo_disgust|> Seriously? That’s so frustrating. It was [NAME] time to go, some of these “fans” are disgusting."
<|emo_fear|> This is the scariest thing I think I’ve ever read on here. That is just so horrible.
"<|emo_anger|> Oh btw this was me yesterday, commenting on that ""ugly"" ban! "
"<|emo_surprise|> Fox News devoted 42 seconds on [NAME], wow."
<|emo_surprise|> lol comment of the night. thank you.
<|emo_anger|> i hate this
"<|emo_fear|> This was posted at the exact same time as another guy posted it on here, and that scares me."
<|emo_anger|> I'm saying your question is irrelevant to the post's topic. Stop being passive aggressive.
"<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry but did anybody else read the first paragraph and get flashbacks to My Immortal? \x45\x62ony [NAME], is that you???"
<|emo_surprise|> So... she just won the lottery!!
<|emo_joy|> I'd be happy to make a donation if you've got some left!
<|emo_disgust|> I just use undercrackers or crackers. Knickers/panties sounds weird when I say it
"<|emo_surprise|> What do you mean by ""free game""? Are you under the assumption that the Executive branch can dictate appropriations?"
<|emo_sad|> as much as I could tolerate - sadly I gave you a view.
<|emo_joy|> Funny. I take mine out of the hair tie and leave it down or in a loose clip.
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME], my eyes are hurting from how furiously they're rolling in my sockets right now."
"<|emo_fear|> Because we don't want another Cold War, or worse on our hands. Russia is a powerful country. Picking a fight could be very risky."
<|emo_sad|> I’m always reminded by my relatives on my birthday asking me if I have a girlfriend yet. Sorry bro ima yeet out of the social norm.

"<|emo_anger|> I was booing loud, so were a lotta others. That muthafuckah"
<|emo_fear|> > ...he was afraid for his life... I see he has mastered the magic incantation.
<|emo_surprise|> What does FPTP have to do with the referendum?
<|emo_surprise|> I'm more surprised the dash cam was functioning properly. Usually around these incidents 3 of them were not recording and one had the lens cap on...
<|emo_surprise|> Not for long!
<|emo_anger|> You are terrible developers.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh this belongs here
<|emo_disgust|> In the letter I told her she was disrespectful and that we will not ask her to housesit again.
<|emo_joy|> Giggled so hard
"<|emo_disgust|> Disgusting, I bet you he will never even be inside that apartment condo ever."
"<|emo_anger|> I literally, like, hate people like that."
"<|emo_disgust|> That was a brutal shift. Honestly he should be playing sheltered minutes. Team needs [NAME] and [NAME] back, give bulk of his minutes to [NAME]. "
<|emo_joy|> Im just glad it didn't take any of that for us. I'm glad I didn't have to see a [NAME] screaming match
"<|emo_disgust|> Ugh, he sounds like a slob and you should leave him."
<|emo_surprise|> How this post is still up??🤔🤔
"<|emo_anger|> Just the fact that people constantly use words like ""incel"" to demean people proves that society is getting worse than it already is."
<|emo_anger|> Hey I just reposted this without reading it dont blame me for it putting boy friend
<|emo_fear|> My parents are going to kill me when they find out.
<|emo_sad|> That's kind of sad to be honest.
<|emo_anger|> Fucking pouliot you're shit
"<|emo_sad|> I find it sadly ironic that a man's job is to protect his family, yet if he's alone with his children they question their safety."
<|emo_joy|> happy cake day
<|emo_joy|> A bit of storybook now and again never hurt anyone :D So happy for the both of you!
<|emo_surprise|> REAL MEN ONLY CRY OVER GILLETTE
<|emo_disgust|> There are worse things!!!:
<|emo_surprise|> Woah up until this comment I thought the same
<|emo_joy|> Amazing work!. I truly enjoyed reading this and read like a page directly from the book.
<|emo_joy|> I have a religious friend who i agreed with early on that we could make fun of each other's beliefs/lack of. We're still best friends :)
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] on a pretzel. That is just...fucked up. Those comments are absolutely...I can’t think of anything awful enough to describe them.
"<|emo_disgust|> And if they can't find US suckers to give them cheap labor with desired skills, they'll simply replace you with an imported indentured laborer from India."
<|emo_anger|> Its ridiculous.
"<|emo_disgust|> Oh gosh, I'm so sorry you had to deal with that. It sounds like you handled it really well. Kids are cruel. "
<|emo_sad|> BROOOO I THOUGHT THIS WAS WOOD ALL ALONG ouuuuccccchhhhh
<|emo_joy|> Makes me very happy indeed.
<|emo_sad|> Your post : 39 minutes ago THE POST THATS LITERALLY UNDER YOU WITH THE SAME MEME : 40 MINUTES AGO

<|emo_sad|> You are one pathetic human being.
<|emo_surprise|> I will be surprised if this actually has an impact. Just a few statements about the importance of the commitment to defeat ISIS and the withdrawal will continue.
<|emo_joy|> I had some pretty bad diarrhea right after the game. It's was more enjoyable than that loss.
"<|emo_joy|> Yeah he was going like ""YOOOO"" and his boy was like yo chill man tf this aint no club keep yo voice down lmao"
<|emo_sad|> I dont want to live in this world no more
<|emo_fear|> Imagine being scared of a black bear

<|emo_joy|> Always a pleasure to have our board of directors pay us a little visit.
<|emo_anger|> Damn you and your facts.
<|emo_surprise|> I am literally dumbstruck. Reality has been brought into question. Top tier YouTube comments though.
<|emo_sad|> Rip hot chocolate 2019-2019
<|emo_disgust|> That magazine cover after her first surgery was awful. She got a chin implant or something I think. Receipt:
<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised he survived the primary.
<|emo_sad|> So. Much. *Effort.* I ca't believe a tree died for this sin.
<|emo_fear|> Being ugly and confident does not mean you'll do well in dating. You'll just try more.
<|emo_anger|> > punishment for saying no to rape Surely if you wanted to rape someone you'd have to punish them for saying yes...
<|emo_disgust|> I just had deja vu reading this comment. Weird.
<|emo_fear|> That creepy realization that everything [NAME] says is projection...
"<|emo_joy|> I was like you man, 3 felt so bad. But street part 4 3 becomes a so bad it's hilarious imo."
<|emo_joy|> I’m on mobile and I can see them. Omg it makes me so happy 😂 never noticed if before either. iPhone btw
"<|emo_disgust|> If I start shoving food into my face as I enjoy everyone here, dis becomes a bery bery unhealthly situation. "
<|emo_anger|> that was such a misstep from their PR. wtf were they thinking people were expecting with a public countdown
<|emo_anger|> What is this fucking r/niceguys bullshit?
<|emo_sad|> That is profoundly messed up.
"<|emo_disgust|> Why,? It’s natural. That’s weird af."
<|emo_joy|> I was at that game!!
<|emo_disgust|> True. You always gotta be careful. It's pretty sad actually. I feel used and abused.
<|emo_sad|> Sorry you can’t enjoy things cause other people enjoy them lol. Your loss
<|emo_anger|> Stop saying that ? Makes my tummy upset 🤢🤮
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry pal, it’s actually one of my least favorites :/"
"<|emo_surprise|> Im not saying it wont be self titled, I could totally see that. What just asking how he knew it was ""fact"""
"<|emo_disgust|> I was there, too. I do NOT remember that, though. Yikes..."
"<|emo_sad|> I've tried a whole lot of things, nothing has worked."
"<|emo_sad|> Bipolar symptoms tend to be very fun and exciting, but they can also be very bad and harmful. She should get some help."
<|emo_sad|> So Green Bay doesn't get him... I'd be sad for the kid.
<|emo_anger|> Poo again? it really is an obsession.
<|emo_surprise|> I’m surprised she didn’t name him Allesandrostien
"<|emo_anger|> THIS IS NOT DETROIT, MAN! THIS IS THE SUPERBOWL!"
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] dude I’m sorry. That’s their problem now. Bump some [NAME] and keep moving forward.
"<|emo_sad|> Thanks, I appreciate that. It's about what I expected though. Sadly, I'm used to it."
<|emo_anger|> There are two different accounts doing this shit atm. Go to r/delusionalartists and sort by new. These guys are being douchebags.
<|emo_disgust|> Same. Body hair (on my own body..I don't care what anybody else does with THEIR body hair) grosses me the fuck out.
"<|emo_anger|> Cuck you're implying I'm vulnerable and submissive??! Hahhhaaaaaaa. You're the cuck here, the young incel loser"
<|emo_surprise|> Anyone else see her 10 year challenge post today or yesterday. I'm so shocked she wouldn't pick this picture.
<|emo_joy|> In good news today: she broke up with him!! Right after he told her he’ll never love her the way she loves him 🙄
"<|emo_disgust|> Awful tattoo , looks like a child ! Get your money back and money for laser treatment."
<|emo_sad|> This is so painfully 80s. I hate it.
<|emo_joy|> Don't make me cry...P.S. Happy cake day!
<|emo_sad|> I’ve been kicked in the leg my foots been stamped on. I can’t imagine the pain of this
<|emo_surprise|> My same thoughts! Post this there and see what options you have! That is unbelieveable your dad would do that!
"<|emo_joy|> “Wow. Just .. wow. Read a book, sweatie!”"
<|emo_sad|> Sorry its such a long post guys
"<|emo_sad|> If it's anything like what happened in France, I'd assume because it disproportionately affects the poor. "
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] pissed off the establishment when ripped off the insurance company and pleaded the fifth.
<|emo_joy|> Best day of the week!
<|emo_anger|> It's ridiculous that [NAME] has inspired way more people to join rather than leave but there are way more media articles by people who have left.
"<|emo_anger|> Most of them don't technically breach the actual law, to my knowledge. Plenty of them are distasteful to me personally though."
<|emo_sad|> Oi he got stabbed in the eye
<|emo_joy|> Cordovan in the mech with the loudspeaker really makes me smile. It is just so bonkers. I love it.
<|emo_joy|> I am so relieved
<|emo_fear|> I'll try that but I'm thinking about going outside when it is unbearable to sleep. Also I'm scared of cold making me more sleepy.
<|emo_anger|> Oh that sucks good luck man
<|emo_joy|> This is so wholesome 😭😭😭
<|emo_joy|> I just wish he got more screen time. Im enjoying this season but I feel like the huge cast of side characters get all the attention.
<|emo_fear|> One of the scariest things about being in a cult is that you don't realize you're in a cult.
"<|emo_disgust|> Yikes. That’s straight up paranoid, you can tell they were looking through comments for someone to rage at. "
"<|emo_disgust|> Wow the garbage one and the bank one are really terrible. I’ve had the coupon ones too, people are touchy about coupons haha."
<|emo_anger|> Minus the eyebrows I personally think it’s an attractive look. But the fucking eyebrows ruin it all.
<|emo_disgust|> This chick is a lunatic now
<|emo_joy|> Yes! And the one who embarrasses you by dancing and singing in the car while she's driving you and your friends home.
<|emo_disgust|> Pig Latin kills me internally this is why plastic surgery exsists.
<|emo_disgust|> *6 objectively [NAME] and [NAME] are terrible at their jobs.
<|emo_surprise|> What Subreddit?
"<|emo_sad|> I feel bad for them now, but if they ever get good I’ll hate them like the rest. "
<|emo_surprise|> I thought this was a diary that I wrote in my notebook! I'm almost exactly the same!
<|emo_anger|> >+. I’m in my early 3 Exactly This. It's the worst.
<|emo_sad|> Are you one of them? Sorry. You asked for it. 😂
"<|emo_disgust|> There were those god awful GoPro shots in the fight scenes where they had a shaky camera fixed to the actors facing directly at their face, though. "
<|emo_joy|> Feels good man
"<|emo_joy|> I still enjoy the content here sometimes, but....finally! This post nailed it."
"<|emo_surprise|> I was there, too. I do NOT remember that, though. Yikes..."
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, how I miss real spicy Chinese food. Day after, not so much."
"<|emo_sad|> Thanks for pointing them out, it's hard to see through my tears 😢"
<|emo_disgust|> How’d you avoid all of the memes?
<|emo_anger|> That sucks. Learn to check your ping like everyone else.
<|emo_anger|> Don't ever be ashamed of who you are
<|emo_anger|> A real man ain't be ashamed of crying. I cry with you my bro. Let's all cry together!
<|emo_anger|> No credit?? This is the brilliant youtube channel You Suck At Cooking
<|emo_surprise|> I was surprised to see [NAME] towing the line on his show.
"<|emo_sad|> I always imagined they would be really easy to refuel, for obvious reasons. I never had the chance though."
<|emo_disgust|> Yep...and they regret it. I hope you stay together!
<|emo_sad|> Lol I’m sorry that has to be terrible if we were up 19 just to get smothered at the end.
<|emo_joy|> It's a perfect loop
"<|emo_anger|> Or more aptly ""OHHHHH FUUUUUuuuck"" As you see me run away."
<|emo_anger|> Shit he gets too close to a girl and she's liable to hit him with roach spray.
<|emo_joy|> The one with the hot honey is also fantastic. Touch of heat and just a hint of sweet. Good food.
<|emo_sad|> Not to mention that half the women out there are immediately disqualified (at least in my book) by having kids.
<|emo_joy|> Let me admit. This show is a guilty pleasure. Seeing these people's lives in such chaos brings me joy.
<|emo_anger|> Then the kids stole my entire house
<|emo_surprise|> It boggles my mind every day how easily conspiracy theorist stuck their flag in Trumpland.
<|emo_fear|> I thought that type of camouflage failed horribly because the high contrast and defined shapes made the ships really stand out.
<|emo_fear|> This is terrifying
<|emo_sad|> Sometimes I get jealous of [NAME].
<|emo_anger|> This. One of my biggest pet peeves. What the hell does it even mean?
<|emo_joy|> Reminds me of this short.
<|emo_anger|> The more you wind me up the worse it gets for her later on
"<|emo_joy|> If this is the kind of game you enjoy, you should REALLY check out Blades in the Dark!"
<|emo_joy|> Same here! Although I just try to be happy whenever I am with my child.
<|emo_anger|> What the fuck are you talking about
<|emo_anger|> I hate everything about this.
"<|emo_surprise|> I was expecting the surprise birthday, not seen this twist on the sister before. "
<|emo_disgust|> Well if he takes his daughter to a nightclub then that’s a bit inappropriate
<|emo_surprise|> That thread is rage-inducing
"<|emo_anger|> Fuuuck, brutal"
<|emo_sad|> I'm sad that I gave that shit article a page view.
<|emo_anger|> he defended [NAME] when [NAME] drugged and butt raped a 13 year old girl
<|emo_sad|> I always feel so bad for [NAME] when I watch this scene.
"<|emo_anger|> Fuuuck, brutal"
<|emo_surprise|> HAHA so sorry. I've had a very slow day at work. Been hitting F5 repeatedly. Was surprised it wasn't already posted.
"<|emo_anger|> If it's Fttn, then not much, maybe worse, because it's still using that shitty old rusted copper running through that same old leaky pit"
<|emo_anger|> Because it's not mildlyinfuriating that you have to ask strangers to not be assholes?
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry, not from her. But from family and friends. We were open to each other about everything."
"<|emo_anger|> Shut up, [NAME]. "
"<|emo_joy|> This is actually so funny, this is something id expect from Australian sports media since we're shit at broadcasting but lmao"
<|emo_sad|> I feel sorry for her son that must have been super cringe
<|emo_joy|> Thank you. I’ve been feeling a bit better since they make people happier.
<|emo_sad|> This is so painfully 80s. I hate it.
<|emo_disgust|> This better be a fucking shitpost.
<|emo_sad|> Oh my gosh. This woman who died also had a son who died. Holy tragedy
<|emo_fear|> I'm actually scared to find out what kind of thing you could get for breakfast there. I won't check.
<|emo_anger|> Fuck. That.
"<|emo_sad|> That's just sad and depressing. Was the race closing before she finished? Well, at least she did it."
<|emo_joy|> That beat slaps. Good memories
"<|emo_fear|> Family first, this ain't no stranger trying to profit. This is blood. "
<|emo_sad|> Absolutely! The Republicans are craven
<|emo_fear|> This kills the country.
"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah it was, it was awful, everyone got sick, I was sick for like a week after that event."
<|emo_sad|> So cringy and desperate
<|emo_joy|> Haha i love chinese food
<|emo_surprise|> Oh no I didn’t see that episode!? She pooped in the car?!
<|emo_joy|> Glad to see that thoughtful doggo found a home here!
<|emo_anger|> I would absolutely hate it if they used it in the games tbh
<|emo_disgust|> My office has very few personal offices. Its awful. Managers need closed spaces so they can talk without everybody hearing
<|emo_disgust|> I hate that you've forced me to deal with a reality I've been blissfully ignoring.
"<|emo_fear|> This isn't about football, [NAME] is a horrible dude."
<|emo_joy|> luckily for us all the retarded companies are plummeting
<|emo_disgust|> These people are so full of hate it's disgusting and disheartening at the same time. How do you de-radicalize these people?
<|emo_surprise|> Handsome man! Getting cuter with the years.
<|emo_surprise|> I was eating watching tonight's episode. OMG I never will again. You all know what I mean. The opening scene!!!
<|emo_sad|> Wtf. And then we wonder why people think DnD players are a bunch of fucking creeps. Sucks that you had to bear witness to such sadness.
"<|emo_sad|> I play those characters all of the time and have never, ever experienced this. "
<|emo_fear|> You nailed the crazy eyes. She scary.
<|emo_joy|> thats cool to hear ... [NAME] really is laughable in this regard
"<|emo_disgust|> They're all bad enough to be lumped in to the same category? You either have very high standards, or none at all."
<|emo_joy|> Modern buildings are horrible.. I’ve felt like this before. Stars and birds still fill me with a sense of wonder most often.
<|emo_disgust|> That was what our media guys said but he is now 1/3 in the shootout (was 1/2). No clue how they butchered that one so badly.
"<|emo_sad|> true I am a troll, but fortunately for me I'm not emotionally invested in it."
<|emo_joy|> I didn’t know it was gonna be that simple Forgive me [NAME] :D
<|emo_disgust|> She sounds hideous.
<|emo_disgust|> It was fucking in!!
"<|emo_joy|> The conversion go muscle probably helped, considering the size of them. I'm super happy for you dude, you've done amazingly!"
<|emo_fear|> I fear it is already too late if he already uses words that should hurt but really don't because of their misuse.
<|emo_anger|> Only issue I have is that tiramisu is a beautifully layered cake and all of that is hidden by the container
<|emo_anger|> I'd argue they are advocating not fighting the fire in your house when the entire neighborhood is engulfed in flames.
<|emo_surprise|> I don't remember this song at all I had it on psp back then.
"<|emo_anger|> they're called queens for a reason, fuck democracy"
<|emo_joy|> Hell yeah. Enjoy your new bachelor life son!
<|emo_disgust|> It doesn't have to only effect one for it to affect women.
<|emo_anger|> This guy fucking gets it.
<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised they've gone this long not knowing [NAME] swears a lot.
<|emo_joy|> Happy birthday [NAME]!
"<|emo_sad|> I’m broke, dealing with my own mental illness, and immediately concerned with just keeping the peace."
<|emo_anger|> “People said I was stupid for stretching out my lobe so far that it ripped. Well who’s stupid NOW?”
"<|emo_surprise|> Dayyuuummm!!! If you ever get another one, you know what to do. (Record it)"
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is ruining the Pittsburgh Steelers culture...don't fucking @ me. Sinking fucking ship
<|emo_anger|> I hate that I was young enough to not remember this but old enough to remember the next Super Bowl....
<|emo_fear|> Yeah it’s fine. Some supplements contain Ashwagandha which affects the gaba receptors so be cautious if you’re already on gabapentin or a beta blocker
<|emo_joy|> Welp these were my happy tears of the days. :’)
<|emo_joy|> Haha. Thank you
<|emo_disgust|> I see you arent familiar with Game of Thrones. I've lived through this before. This fan base will be obnoxious.
<|emo_sad|> The best losers of grand finals cod has ever seen
<|emo_surprise|> That's what I was wondering too.
<|emo_anger|> Outraged suburban white moms ranting about stupid things that don’t matter and making ridiculous comparisons are peak humor
<|emo_anger|> Can holiday just stop fucking shooting? I can’t wait till he gets traded.
"<|emo_disgust|> I just realized people in apartments are essentially screwed, that is too bad man, hopefully you'll get that going soon! It's worth it!"
<|emo_disgust|> We dont want or deserve to win this game. Sloppy sloppy sloppy
<|emo_joy|> McRibs are back on the menu but not in the Washington DC metro area.
"<|emo_joy|> come on, Redwings won, Knights need to win. give me another 2-fer, baby!"
<|emo_anger|> Can you fucking not
<|emo_anger|> I will call the police if you dont stop harassing me
"<|emo_joy|> Outstanding, really outstanding. I can't wait for her visit to the United States."
<|emo_surprise|> Gotta wonder how a fake BC could possibly result from a 'mixup'.
<|emo_fear|> This is how far the Broncos have fallen. They no longer command the best and the brightest. Now it's .500 retreads. This should be concerning.
<|emo_joy|> What's it matter where this came from? It fits every content guideline and we're enjoying it.
"<|emo_sad|> > All the complexity was lost in Oblivion, and it was a huge disappointment. So you are agreeing with me?"
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] fucking [NAME] please no
"<|emo_surprise|> I understand that there are exceptions but saying a knife is as dangerous as, or more dangerous than a gun is a little ridiculous."
<|emo_disgust|> It really sucks people are downvoting you just because they were worried about blowing themselves up just like us nova bomb users.
"<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised not to see whining about [NAME] books more often, speaking of children."
<|emo_disgust|> That would be terrible. I liked the way private Practice ended (more or less) so hopefully [NAME] doesn’t go for something cliche.
<|emo_disgust|> They have directly targeted civilians. It's disgusting.
"<|emo_anger|> Ignore him, he is a spiteful little rat who is mad because someone did something good and it reminds him how pathetic he is."
<|emo_joy|> So close to that dudes nether bits. Perfect
<|emo_fear|> Wow yeah similar to my story what a nightmare :(
<|emo_sad|> But it is over boyo
"<|emo_anger|> Nashville as a whole is easily one of the most classist, racist, judgemental, prejudiced cities I've set foot in. "
<|emo_disgust|> Crafty little bastards.
<|emo_disgust|> It'd be a real shame if someone killed it and stole its soul.
<|emo_surprise|> Shes stunning haha
<|emo_disgust|> i’m so glad you’re wrong lol
"<|emo_anger|> Yea that 3rd period was pretty bad tho, [NAME]"
<|emo_surprise|> Opinions? I mean that's just a statement.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow thanks I never knew! I might try to take a tour!
<|emo_disgust|> Some bioshock shit right here.
"<|emo_anger|> And also, turning someone's hands into spaghetti is cruel and inhumane and not a reasonable punishment for theft."
"<|emo_anger|> Hopefully they can bounce back and take out the anger of this loss on the pistons, then start a new win streak"
<|emo_surprise|> This was literally me!
<|emo_sad|> The guy is seriously neurotic.
<|emo_fear|> OMG the bra hanging out of the back of that dress is so cringe.
<|emo_sad|> Oh no the poor man
<|emo_sad|> All voting has all sorts of problems. Struggling to find a point to your post.
<|emo_joy|> He remains the only serve bot I enjoy watching.
"<|emo_disgust|> I mean it makes sense, they're into [NAME] because they totally dig the horribly socially stunted types so they love [NAME] for horribly traumatizing her."
"<|emo_disgust|> Exactly, last year was frustrating with our [NAME] awful home record. "
<|emo_joy|> Enjoy friend.
<|emo_fear|> I’ve never cringed so hard
<|emo_joy|> I just got kerbal space program flashbacks
<|emo_anger|> Goddam it!
<|emo_sad|> It’s really sad to see
<|emo_anger|> Idk you seem pretty miserable and really bitter and angry. It must be exhausting and I hope you find happiness some day.
"<|emo_surprise|> Rollin the green for 48 hours, weed will make you feel like you got awesome powers, like flight."
<|emo_surprise|> > Love is more important than some job. You can't be serious? Please tell me you're just joking.
<|emo_joy|> The frankness of this comment made me giggle
"<|emo_fear|>  I'm scared to even ask my mom ,I might get yelled at 😟"
"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, I didn't know that you used to mod there."
"<|emo_sad|> That's really sad to hear, I can't imagine. I'm wishing the best for you"
<|emo_sad|> Hate to see him go. The only thing I’m complaining about besides this was the hagelin trade back in November. Both hit home
<|emo_anger|> Not a single one of these allegations are of Russian collusion. It's more perjury trap nonsense.
<|emo_anger|> Test levels have been dropping significantly It’s well documented Why do you think that’s stupid
"<|emo_joy|> Run, run Run for the roses Quicker it opens Sooner it closes Man oh man oh friend of mine All good things in all good time"
"<|emo_surprise|> I’m surprised it was uploaded today, especially since he uploaded a video just a few hours ago"
<|emo_joy|> I'm elated to hear that 🤗
"<|emo_joy|> I’m really high and laughed too hard at this video, normally I would feel really bad for the old fella."
<|emo_disgust|> >My worst vice is vaping [NAME] to say you are not promiscuous. 😉
"<|emo_joy|> The double fist bump made me smile, her happiness was contagious"
<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry that happened. Was her hospice nurse aware that she was suffering?
"<|emo_joy|> Wow, I love the car ride idea. Thanks for sharing that!"
<|emo_sad|> I don't know how everyone is falling for this lmao. Cringing a bit.
<|emo_joy|> So happy the new rules weren't in place back then. All those hard hits on [NAME] would have made the refs flag-happy
"<|emo_fear|> Fam, I didn't have him kill [NAME] so I can do it next episode"
"<|emo_joy|> I think everyone should watch the first season. It's hilarious, but also a pretty brutal indictment about what a show politics is."
"<|emo_sad|> 2018 was the worst year for Sydney Trains, I’ve lost count of the number of cancelled services due to power outages and train drivers calling in sick"
<|emo_surprise|> Are you allowed to voice any political opinion on Youtube or are they also censoring based on this?
<|emo_joy|> I love it. :D
<|emo_surprise|> OMG kids are dying from polio??
<|emo_surprise|> hahaha. I was/am honestly surprised that is the only time I've heard of a parent calling a rapid.
"<|emo_joy|> It’s always entertaining watching people in the background semi-dance, while being painfully aware that they’re on camera"
<|emo_surprise|> Wait is this a euphemism for ditching your husband and finding a new partner or did you lose 179 pounds?!?!
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME], I love the Expanse so much. Next to Mindhunter, Daredevil, and Breaking Bad, I've never enjoyed a series like those 4."
"<|emo_anger|> No,no, you are right we should murder everyone we hate other wise hateful people win. "
<|emo_sad|> He’s oppressed! An innocent man is going to be killed!
<|emo_joy|> This is my favorite reddit conversation I’ve seen in a while
"<|emo_disgust|> Why,? It’s natural. That’s weird af."
"<|emo_anger|> No,no, you are right we should murder everyone we hate other wise hateful people win. "
<|emo_anger|> Why would you cross while an event is going...
<|emo_disgust|> She was walking like that shoe was up her butt at the club. So tacky and just nah.
<|emo_surprise|> I’m this close to buying a tweezer and doing my own eyebrows but I’m fully aware it’s the masculinity stopping me lmao.
<|emo_surprise|> Never seen an abandoned piss trolley at a bus stop in Armadale ever
<|emo_disgust|> I learned about [NAME] about 1749485 times in medical school lmao Soap helped a ton but it just did not cut it after a while
"<|emo_fear|> Oh god, going to a social event with someone and never leaving their side is me at almost every social event I go to."
<|emo_sad|> In combination? Also interaction my Bipolar meds + blood pressure meds almost killed me. I now have very choices in meds.
<|emo_fear|> Must be a terrible swim team. The only thing that your neck beard does is accentuates your double chin.
"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, for real? I'm 250 and drink regularly, if I pound two beers in under a minute I'm good for a little while."
<|emo_anger|> that was a horrible mess with 3k skills
<|emo_surprise|> Wow .. this is more terrifying than if they were a ghost ! Amazing twist
"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, apparently they're wrong. It is a bummer and only getting worse, it seems."
"<|emo_disgust|> No more [NAME] from Georgia. Suck it you old, ugly hag."
<|emo_sad|> I feel bad for that other little girl that was the only one not to get a puck
<|emo_anger|> Somebody gettin fired
<|emo_disgust|> She would betray her friends for chicken nuggets
<|emo_disgust|> The very worst possible route they could have gone.
<|emo_joy|> Now that's what I call projection!
<|emo_surprise|> Son: I can't believe you were in i-wreck
"<|emo_disgust|> They never seem to think this when the police arrive, with their guns, to end a terrible situation. "
<|emo_joy|> It's because you play against 1000 ms ping EU players that have no idea what's going on. Happy hunting!
<|emo_surprise|> Just another day in the life of a Scottish football fan remembering that Sky Sports are absolutely shocking I suppose.
"<|emo_fear|> Spoiler alert, it's terrifying and depressiong"
<|emo_anger|> I'm accusing you of framing [NAME] for murder. Where are your records?
<|emo_anger|> Oh look another shit call
<|emo_fear|> 2005? I think we might be the same person lol. What a terrible year. I go back to that one a lot.
<|emo_sad|> I'm too late to rub this into all the casual's faces. :(
<|emo_anger|> Fuck your husband
<|emo_joy|> I'm so glad you're annoyed.
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what a hug would feel like a lot too.
<|emo_anger|> Except forming an opinion of a topic without even having basic knowledge of said topic makes you sound pretty arrogant and entirely undercuts your opinion.
<|emo_joy|> Thank you so much. I'm really glad you found yourself. I hope to get there.
<|emo_sad|> Looks like your hormones are not working properly.
<|emo_fear|> What's worse is using self destruct without the pilot DLC. You just die :(
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] you people are so fucking dumb
<|emo_sad|> aw :(
"<|emo_anger|> Given that you're not a conservative and this isn't a debate sub, how about you just get the hell out and stay out."
<|emo_anger|> I deserved it. I'm a garbage cumslut. He owned me and he took his property.
<|emo_anger|> The fucking worst game in the world.
<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck [NAME]! Are you easy to talk to? 29 years and you didn't see it coming?
<|emo_disgust|> No fuck that guy. I'm actually relived he was shot. Sounds like a sack of human garbage
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah right like they always talk about themselves why can’t I gets me so pissed off
<|emo_anger|> Maybe? I was def too busy going “ohmygawd motherfucking KING SHARK!?! 🦈 “ to notice
<|emo_anger|> I'm with the photo guy. It would be an awful feeling to watch your date flirt with some other dude ON YOUR DATE.
<|emo_fear|> Student of the game. Amazing physical attributes and devastating punching power. Humble enough to take bits and pieces from legends
<|emo_surprise|> ah fuck. From xbox to zullily? seriously!?
<|emo_joy|> EXACTLY. gimme some muscly arms and a little bit of a belly. I'd take that over a rock hard body any day of the week.
<|emo_surprise|> Probably. Wouldn't be surprised if our current generation essentially lives forever...or well until something like climate change puts a stop to it.
"<|emo_fear|> Not the right sub, I'm afraid."
<|emo_anger|> In the worst of the anger phase I took up running. It’s hard to stay in that state while your legs are burning that much.
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah, I was very sad to read that!"
<|emo_anger|> Don't make me cry...P.S. Happy cake day!
"<|emo_joy|> I don't play assassins much, but I love playing Rat."
<|emo_sad|> I have my reasons for wanting to quit
"<|emo_anger|> Yes, which is why I hate the term ""ranked choice voting""."
<|emo_fear|> I've debated shaving my head just to avoid this. My haircuts often get stretched several extra weeks because i'm dreading it.
<|emo_joy|> That and customizable CSS makes me so happy. /r/Firefoxcss if you’re interested : )
"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I've been finding it so hard to not eat everything in sight since Christmas. I'm still staying under my TDEE, but I feel nasty. "
"<|emo_anger|> Honestly, I have a hard time sleeping in socks. The fuzzy ones are the worst because they slide around on my feet."
<|emo_joy|> I love how the dog is just happy the cat is giving him attention.
<|emo_anger|> Suck really hard and hope it ends soon? And don't swallow!!! Bleck - sex is so much better with a woman.
"<|emo_anger|> BDS is a discriminatory bigoted hateful movement. It's not just ""Oh, I disagree with some things that Israel has done."""
"<|emo_anger|> Kill me, [NAME] "
<|emo_anger|> I mean. Wtf is there to do online. GTAO had a shit economy but at least had things to do
"<|emo_joy|> He had doubts but no matter, the baby changed his life and he wouldn't abandon it no matter what :)!"
"<|emo_joy|> I enjoyed it somewhat, but haven't felt like rewatching (or owning) it."
<|emo_surprise|> OMG what??? ...[NAME] actually showed up for a gig without cancelling with a terrible excuse?
"<|emo_disgust|> Nobody consciously thinks ""today I feel like chewing with my mouth open""."
<|emo_anger|> Me too.. which left me conflicted about how to feel.
<|emo_anger|> Really bad trap if noone falls for it
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah lol, my bad. "
<|emo_surprise|> Wow. You basically found my dream woman and gave her up.
<|emo_sad|> Immigrant children dying in state camps? Horrible. Healthcare for the poor and eldery? Also horrible! Got it.
"<|emo_joy|> Looks like this one worked out juuuuuuust fine. Happy pizza giving, fellow redditor. 💜"
<|emo_sad|> You are unfortunately far and few between.
<|emo_fear|> My husband never watches this show. Watching with me: “[NAME] is a horrible dad. He looks likes he hammered. He’s so greasy”
"<|emo_sad|> There are good reasons but you potatos just brush it all off with ""hurr life is bad cause bad things happen sometimes"""
"<|emo_sad|> Yes, it can be a very stressful read at times."
<|emo_surprise|> Omg congratz for you guys!!!!! That is amazing news :) good luck with twins.
<|emo_disgust|> Maybe a relationship where you don't live together would suit him better. Some people feel suffocated when they are with their partner for long stretches of time.
<|emo_anger|> I need to amend: Fuck the Patriots and fuck [NAME] in particular.
<|emo_anger|> Yes what the fuck is going on here
<|emo_anger|> You didn't deserve to win after drafting [NAME] in the 2nd
"<|emo_sad|> Pet-sitting is over, didn't know I was lonely without a doggo until now. "
<|emo_anger|> The f****** voice of the unsolved mysteries guy
<|emo_fear|> This is getting out of hand! Now there’s two of them!
"<|emo_joy|> At the very least, I’m glad he tried something other than the standard blue. And yeah, I think the title is above-average as well. "
"<|emo_sad|> P3 hit me so hard in the feels that every time I hear a song from it or watch anything P3 related, I just burst into tears."
<|emo_sad|> Imagine the baby being retarded
"<|emo_sad|> Such a sad, angry person. Take a break from reddit and go take up cycling or something."
<|emo_surprise|> This is a great idea. I'd even figure out where my printer ended up after I moved and set it up for this.
<|emo_sad|> Bro. You think roads and infrastructure wouldnt be built if it wasn’t for the government? My sentiment still stands. I pity you.
<|emo_disgust|> Kinda weird after you find out he wrote those songs while thinking about underage girls.
<|emo_anger|> First is the worst
<|emo_joy|> It would work just fine. I wear medium shirts and a small or medium jersey fits me great.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] has to be spinning in his grave right now
<|emo_anger|> Lol kill me now
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] damn cummonists
<|emo_fear|> what are you scared of!
<|emo_sad|> This was potentially the most dangerous stunt I have ever seen someone do. One minor mistake and you die.
<|emo_sad|> Yeah that's where I think the problem lies. It's that I don't really want to be open to others.
"<|emo_joy|> That's totally my focus for today, just enjoy the day and being there for myself :) it's so liberating."
"<|emo_joy|> Ah yes, my favorite waifu: Picasso-San. "
"<|emo_disgust|> See a lawyer, there's more trouble coming from your ex... She likes free money And a accountant..."
<|emo_anger|> Fuck daesh *
<|emo_sad|> Imagine ur mom doing that I’m crying
<|emo_joy|> i get the joke and still think this sucks.
"<|emo_anger|> I have a feeling this is gonna get really crowded, and end up being a shit show with such short notice for everything."
<|emo_joy|> That dog was so happy I thought he was gonna start flying like tails the fox in sonic
<|emo_sad|> Truly wretched.
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah and if the media finds out that they weren't drug related we will never hear of it again
<|emo_joy|> Glad your a Liberal supporter.
<|emo_sad|> Then [NAME] insults [NAME] and he cries
<|emo_anger|> Holy shit.
<|emo_disgust|> Having met [NAME] wife (figuratively)... I reckon [NAME] is a bit of a monster...
<|emo_sad|> Two overtime games on championship Sunday? We are blessed as football fans. Too bad one game had to be between FYTB and FUKC
<|emo_sad|> When you can't hold in years of emotional trauma anymore
<|emo_fear|> You're creepy
<|emo_anger|> Yes. I hate everything that has to do with my depression.
"<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry but did anybody else read the first paragraph and get flashbacks to My Immortal? \x45\x62ony [NAME], is that you???"
<|emo_anger|> Your passion for [NAME] literally put a big smile on my face. Stay wavy!
<|emo_anger|> It’s pretty captivating in a make you want to throw up and then beat the shit out of [NAME] kinda way.
"<|emo_surprise|> Yeh pretty rough. I mean we all know [NAME] won, but it was much closer than that "
<|emo_surprise|> Don't know how that was missed. Tragic really. Considering the title.
"<|emo_anger|> Lost his legs, what an idiot."
<|emo_joy|> I laughed. But I'm really not sure if I should upvote.
<|emo_sad|> That sounds so terrible. I'm very sorry.
<|emo_joy|> I’m interested!
<|emo_disgust|> SOME newborns are ugly. I did think my little sister was ugly af.
<|emo_joy|> Yep gave me goosebumps.
<|emo_surprise|> My god he looks so different without a scowl or smirk on his face! He looks genuinely happy
<|emo_anger|> Hate them. I really don't need to hear about you pissing your pants in the first grade.
"<|emo_anger|> Watch your back u/Youareapooptard, [NAME] might hunt you down and burn you alive for that relatively minor insult"
<|emo_fear|> this off season is dark and full of terrors
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME], don't fucking front the pass if your help defender is [NAME] he will not help you"
"<|emo_fear|> Neat idea, but it looks terrible as a tool. It's faster to just separate with your hands. "
<|emo_sad|> I had one of those... my cat broke it.
<|emo_disgust|> Things were significantly worse back then than they are now.
"<|emo_sad|> It's like how I feel after I eat McDonalds. Satisfied, disappointed, sad, full, tired. "
<|emo_surprise|> ISN'T YOUR CLUB RUN BY A JABBA-THE-HUT-LOOKING DONALD-TRUMP-ACTING MORON WITH A ~~FIVE SIX SEVEN TEN~~ FIFTEEN YEAR PLAN?
"<|emo_fear|> Like it was over wayyyyy too fast for a real one. Shit, the Taliban lasted for years, and ISIS is still a huge problem."
<|emo_anger|> Go play Farmville if you can't keep it up.
"<|emo_joy|> 😂 i need one too i’m on break and honestly my life revolves around reddit at this point, cake day is special enjoy it! "
<|emo_joy|> Running with a gun and a sensor dart out makes me feel so cool.
"<|emo_anger|> Seriously? That’s so frustrating. It was [NAME] time to go, some of these “fans” are disgusting."
"<|emo_anger|> I'm a Broncos fan. I'll never, ever root for the Chargers, Chiefs or Raiders. Who the fuck would? "
<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry. Now my entire bad pun looks even worse than it did when I started.
"<|emo_joy|> _Ooh, it looks like we just sold the last one earlier today_"
<|emo_sad|> Or you just get rejected and then not murdered and your anxiety worsens until you can no longer approach women or even men.
"<|emo_joy|> How about this, you can be the ""bigger man"" and the rest of us will bask in the tears of saints fans. "
"<|emo_anger|> No thanks, I would prefer to not get infested with malware. "
<|emo_disgust|> The only time this movie should encourage blindfolds is when watching it. Then hopefully you won’t witness the giant plot holes and terrible ending.
"<|emo_joy|> This 2D-meets-3D feel has been in all Paper Mario games, they all have an interesting take on it."
<|emo_anger|> I just hope [NAME] isn't pulling the wagon. Would hate for her to throw up.
<|emo_fear|> A walker kid hanging from a basketball hoop [NAME]: [Visible Concern]
<|emo_sad|> Just split for gods sake before kids are born.
<|emo_anger|> I'm sorry my Baby [NAME] joke made you so angry.
<|emo_sad|> I hope you survive this. Losing a friend is a heavy loss
"<|emo_anger|> Get em chief, fuck em, I find those people annoying as hell and I barely even use Instagram/twitter"
<|emo_anger|> Never said that. Not once. Punishment isn’t slavery. Unless you’d rather just kill lawbreakers
"<|emo_sad|> Unfortunately, we live in 21st century America, where this kind of behavior ensures that they will both be given high-paying jobs at CNN."
<|emo_surprise|> woah this is a reversal of the norm you took a meme from instagram to reddit
<|emo_sad|> I miss [NAME] butt.
"<|emo_joy|> This junk is entertainment to most of you, but I just can't take anymore."
<|emo_anger|> What the fuckkkkk burn itt
"<|emo_surprise|> This is not surprising at all. She's a fake trendy ""feminist"" with no perspective whatsoever."
<|emo_anger|> i hate this
"<|emo_joy|> I would be unfulfilled and unhappy. I enjoy meat, thankfully I own my own plot of land and can hunt on it at will."
<|emo_sad|> Every time there's a video in my sub box I get really excited and then it's Fortnite. It's heartbreaking.
<|emo_sad|> >![NAME]. Apologies to the Hiyoko Best Girl gang but I could never get myself to like her...!<
"<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst meme format in the history of meme formats, maybe ever"
<|emo_disgust|> Every time [NAME] opens his mouth...he says the same damn thing.
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry man, I have no idea either! "
<|emo_disgust|> It's going to get awfully dark and cold at night.
"<|emo_disgust|> I mean hard to get If you don't have These mental problems, I got some from a friend and they are very useful to stop trips "
<|emo_sad|> Sad... RIP
<|emo_disgust|> >Doctor: So do you cancel a lot of plans you make with friends >Me: uh technically no
<|emo_sad|> And unfortunately videos like this act as a constant reminder that most people are complete dumbasses. Sad really.
<|emo_anger|> Kick him out. Overgrown baby.
<|emo_disgust|> What's worse is using self destruct without the pilot DLC. You just die :(
<|emo_surprise|> Don’t know how I missed that
<|emo_disgust|> That's fine I'll still be here calling out your ridiculousness regardless.
"<|emo_anger|> My friend on PS4 said that if you don’t stay to kill the bear, you can’t kill it."
<|emo_surprise|> The comment was so terrible. I can’t believe it made the final cut.
"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, it's disgusting & I'm so disturbed by everything going on. Never ever would I have believed this is where people were headed. "
<|emo_sad|> That game hurt.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, your posting history is a real... interesting ride."
<|emo_surprise|> Do you want to be promoted to Secreatary of State for the US?
<|emo_surprise|> So you're saying there's a chance I'm a bot... I don't even know what's real anymore!
"<|emo_surprise|> And he doesn’t even stop. It’s your work truck, man! They’re going to find out regardless. "
<|emo_sad|> Welp these were my happy tears of the days. :’)
<|emo_fear|> Being bullied is what taught me I wasn't wanted anywhere.
<|emo_fear|> Pins are given out? My store hordes that shit like there’s a coming apocalypse and pins are the only thing that will save them.
<|emo_sad|> The only one to really be sad about losing is [NAME] tbh
<|emo_fear|> Well she’s still kind of awful but she’s hilarious. Definitely a huge improvement. I could barely watch her!!
<|emo_sad|> I feel so bad anytime I see anyone fall on their face... I just want to make sure they are ok.
"<|emo_joy|> A data scientist extracts information out of usually very big data sets, applying statistics and the likes."
<|emo_disgust|> I get all the deja smells and it's terrible.
<|emo_joy|> im excited!
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] just reminded us last night why he’s paid his ridiculous wages
<|emo_surprise|> What an unbelievable coward
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] dude I’m sorry. That’s their problem now. Bump some [NAME] and keep moving forward.
<|emo_joy|> Hahaha well good! Let me know if you have any questions or anything
<|emo_joy|> I feel the opposite. It was gripping and I loved the pace of it all. Very well made. To each their own I guess.
<|emo_sad|> Lol I’m sorry that has to be terrible if we were up 19 just to get smothered at the end.
"<|emo_anger|> WHERE THR HECK IS VOL'JIN AND MY TROLL EMPIRE, YEARS HAVE PASSED WE HAVE 2 PANDA AND STILL ONE TROLL"
<|emo_joy|> I’m glad at least one good thing could come from my experience!
"<|emo_surprise|> I'm not saying to hate them, I'm wondering why this sub just started worshiping them."
"<|emo_joy|> Oh no, the gig is up. I'm really [NAME]. LOL"
<|emo_sad|> “Start caring about Reddit downvotes” has to be the weirdest life advice I’ve received in years.
"<|emo_anger|> You monster, I hate it. Well played."
<|emo_surprise|> Omg. This is the real gem in this post. Thank you sir
<|emo_fear|> It would be terrible if he died and they put his head in a jar or something
<|emo_joy|> Happy one week anniversary
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] that is frightening...
<|emo_sad|> I had some pretty bad diarrhea right after the game. It's was more enjoyable than that loss.
"<|emo_surprise|> whoa, mama mia, boy"
<|emo_fear|> That is the stuff of nightmares...seriously.
<|emo_disgust|> This stresses me out way too much.
"<|emo_disgust|> I have seen some terrible minion stuff, I thought I've seen the worst of the worst. I was wrong...I was horribly wrong."
"<|emo_joy|> ...it was a corgi, and that dog looked happy as hell."
"<|emo_fear|> If you are really so dead set against shoveling sidewalks, perhaps you should move to a warmer climate. "
"<|emo_surprise|> When it gushed out I caught myself saying ""ooof"" out loud"
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, /r/noisygifs for real. First time I genuinely felt I could hear it."
"<|emo_joy|> Eeeee busted, I couldn’t help myself hehe. "
<|emo_disgust|> Who is your least hated and absolute worst? (Outfit based only)
<|emo_disgust|> A new mattress if you can swing it. Company provided mattresses are typically pretty garbage.
<|emo_joy|> Nice! I'm glad there was a great turnout. Congrats!
"<|emo_surprise|> You do not look anywhere near 12, you look alot older than 19. To bad i only dated as young as 23 as i would date you"
<|emo_joy|> We like what we like.
<|emo_surprise|> Ah the old cross your legs to make it look like you have hips trick.
"<|emo_anger|> I used to hate them too, but since vikendi I’ve gotten pretty used to them "
<|emo_anger|> Just keep it. You’re going to go through more brain damage than it’s worth.
<|emo_surprise|> a surprise to be sure
<|emo_anger|> they dont pay shit
<|emo_anger|> > least I immagine most bi people don’t care. No we do care.
"<|emo_anger|> Wow, that's just incredibly racist."
<|emo_anger|> You don’t have to hate players just for being on a different team. I hate that [NAME] is an [NAME]. I don’t hate [NAME]
<|emo_surprise|> This is amazing. WTF.
"<|emo_joy|> and now i went there...and got ragey and stabby LOL wtaf is wrong with people?! obviously, rhetorical question...but wtaf"
"<|emo_anger|> My reaction was a dejected ""ahhhh damn....."""
<|emo_anger|> exactly. you're a child. you make personal attacks when you lose an argument. I feel sorry for you.
<|emo_joy|> We’re all bible on this blessed day
<|emo_sad|> I'm having a hard time understanding what exactly happened. I'm sorry you're having these problems. 🙁
<|emo_fear|> This is dangerous.
<|emo_anger|> Don't you even dare try to put any blame on [NAME]
"<|emo_surprise|> That's still a fucking insane number. 70% is goddamn insanity, and the only reason you're alright with it is because you're unaffected."
"<|emo_sad|> My [NAME], check your corners people. I guess it's harder on console to let the team know though."
<|emo_sad|> I bring great shame on my family with my poops. If only I had the will of dear god emperor [NAME] to halt my poops indefinitely like is able.
<|emo_joy|> I remember reading this on a rage comic site 7 years ago hahaha!
"<|emo_joy|> Yeh pretty rough. I mean we all know [NAME] won, but it was much closer than that "
<|emo_fear|> I understand it but still can't ask questions. I am too afraid
<|emo_surprise|> damnnn wendell. just willed that one in
<|emo_disgust|> I feel digestive regret just looking at them.
"<|emo_anger|> FUCK YOU CHAD, WE ARE COOL GAMERS RISE UP😎😎😎💯💯💯💯💯🔥🔥👅 BOTTOM TEXT "
<|emo_joy|> This is my favourite game of all time and I miss it dearly. I made most of my best friends playing this game.
<|emo_anger|> what a cruelly poetic fact
<|emo_joy|> They still make VCRs? This makes me happy and I’m not quite sure why.
<|emo_disgust|> Ew. Being raped is not getting laid
<|emo_disgust|> Out of all the seasons I definitely feel the worst for her
"<|emo_disgust|> > your character is so yuck Thank you, for confirming my suspicions of who/what you are."
<|emo_anger|> Astrology and asttonomy used to be the same thing. The scientific aspect diverged and got renamed to astronomy to distance itself from the bullshit.
<|emo_anger|> Ducks just happy. Hadn’t had a shit for days
<|emo_sad|> That's bad
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, who can afford this one? "
<|emo_disgust|> Their numbers seem large because they get so much publicity. But I suspect that even most young people find that ludicrous.
<|emo_joy|> it's a joke
<|emo_surprise|> I think they’re gonna keep her a surprise.
<|emo_surprise|> I wondered the same thing. I never knew that this is a thing.
<|emo_sad|> I always move back and always regret it.
<|emo_anger|> Wasn’t there a video of the exact same dude kicking down a fucking tree????
<|emo_surprise|> Last 30 seconds where [NAME] and [NAME] were silent to listen to the crowd gave me chills. Such a fun game and team! Aho is my dad
<|emo_disgust|> Moms overreact. Is funking your junk really that bad?
"<|emo_anger|> Eh. People really are judgemental towards ""hoes"", so I don't blame them. What is stupid is to shame people for having sex."
<|emo_sad|> This was probably one of the best videos I’ve ever seen on Reddit. What an amazing story. Job well done. RIP Chief.
"<|emo_joy|> Just because you would laugh, doesn't mean that the guy in the video would."
<|emo_joy|> Fun game. Good expansion too
<|emo_anger|> Your girlfriend is cruel and emotionally manipulative. Get the hell out and don’t let anyone else treat you like a dirty little secret again.
<|emo_sad|> This is so sad. #playdespacito
<|emo_surprise|> Cheers brother. That’s very interesting. First time I’ve seen that article.
<|emo_joy|> Didn’t ruin anything imo. He made one of my favorite films of all time
"<|emo_sad|> ""Oceans"" by Hillsong United. Song gave me a migraine then and still does now."
<|emo_joy|> This makes me so happy!
<|emo_surprise|> What if she’s also the franchise owner who likes to get to know her customers better?
<|emo_surprise|> > The defunct club still sit third in the overall NI league roll of honour despite not having competed for 70 years. Wow
<|emo_joy|> Niemi is absolutely amazing tonight
<|emo_sad|> Nothing seems to intrigue or satisfy me only drugs and thats sad.
<|emo_fear|> Of course. It would mean you owe them an unspecified favor in the future. That would be horrible.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, the level of evidence that you accept is more or less abysmal."
<|emo_anger|> I hate that we cant be trusted to self criticize and we have to have Russian news do it. It feels like watching fox.
"<|emo_surprise|> This is an incredible insight I've never thought of before. loyalty vs disloyalty, compared to care vs harm, I mean."
"<|emo_joy|> While [NAME] lighter take on [NAME] in Justice League was questionable, I enjoyed him in BvS. Excited to see who takes on the cowl next."
"<|emo_sad|> Didn’t know if you knew, so I was just trying to give context to your statement. Sorry. "
<|emo_anger|> Dude was using his power and leadership to exploit women. This is gross.
"<|emo_sad|> The anniversary march was held in Derry Sunday past , not one mention on BBC itv not a thing. 14 people murdered in cold blood. Nothing."
<|emo_joy|> I’m on mobile and I can see them. Omg it makes me so happy 😂 never noticed if before either. iPhone btw
<|emo_sad|> I miss my Shrek Ghrok :(
"<|emo_anger|> I'm saying [NAME] is the pretentious one, and that the original commenter's response to him is a perfect mockery of the asshole "
"<|emo_disgust|> Finally, I can sit on another person’s lap and have them not be disgusted"
<|emo_sad|> This is one of the new accounts that tried to call me a cunt!
<|emo_surprise|> no way I have never heard of that! wow!
<|emo_anger|> They took my favorite hair gel!! The bastards! Good thing I took a picture of it beforehand just in case
<|emo_joy|> Omg I love it
<|emo_anger|> I killed them for the first time in my most recent playthrough and regretted it. The replacement council sucks just as hard.
<|emo_surprise|> > The defunct club still sit third in the overall NI league roll of honour despite not having competed for 70 years. Wow
<|emo_joy|> Love the place but be ready to wait. They really do take the time to make sure you look good and fresh.
<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting. And not one parent thought that was a *bit* inappropriate? smh
"<|emo_surprise|> My dyslexia read that as ""McFucking brilliant"" and I was wondering if we could make it a thing."
<|emo_disgust|> You forgot to block the name in the tweet they're responding to
"<|emo_joy|> Wow, impressive... And how long until it breaks and they decide it's not worth repairing?"
<|emo_sad|> That is the end-all and be-all of the situation. if you feel upset or insecure you should definitely be creeped out as he's doing it.
"<|emo_disgust|> I couldn't get my wife on board. She insists on eating a ""real dinner""."
<|emo_fear|> Wait for real? That's how they met? lol that's both terrifying and completely fitting considering how nuts they both are
<|emo_sad|> I always cry when [NAME] is on screen.
<|emo_disgust|> Ugh the fans smh
<|emo_anger|> I AM CALLING THE POLICE
<|emo_anger|> You'll feel better about yourself if you don't act like an asshole to people who care about you.
"<|emo_fear|> Like it was over wayyyyy too fast for a real one. Shit, the Taliban lasted for years, and ISIS is still a huge problem."
<|emo_joy|> Close game but glad to see we came back in the end
<|emo_sad|> Sadly no... I’m in Delaware 😩. But I’d love to help in any way I can. Keep me posted. 
<|emo_surprise|> I'm thinking I'd be wondering how I got my hands on a time machine.
<|emo_surprise|> Interesting I wasn't aware of this. Maybe proving the undue hardship is difficult but technically allowed? I wonder what counts.
"<|emo_sad|> Not gonna lie. Sucked out a few, but am really trying to analyze my play afterwards. Thanks!"
<|emo_surprise|> So many? I’d be amazed if it was more than 0.1% of active players at any time
<|emo_fear|> What's the cringe?
<|emo_sad|> I’m dying! Perfect!
"<|emo_joy|> It's easy to overthink things online, I'm glad you gave him a chance."
"<|emo_surprise|> Sex lesson for a 28 year old oh god, but I see the point you’re tryin make and I’ll try it! "
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME], I love the Expanse so much. Next to Mindhunter, Daredevil, and Breaking Bad, I've never enjoyed a series like those 4."
<|emo_disgust|> Cats are repulsive and they don't deserve to be pets
<|emo_disgust|> Sometimes I get jealous of [NAME].
<|emo_fear|> Women have a right to their own bodies. Your comments are horribly patronizing. They indicate that women intellectually develop slower than men which is sexist.
"<|emo_anger|> What ""same thing""? You're not addressing any of my actual argument and have barely been doing so for a while."
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, the irony,."
<|emo_anger|> I kill him before he kills me during the date
<|emo_disgust|> Long straight hair on the face is going to look quite odd I would guess.
"<|emo_anger|> > like a fucking peregrine falcon, her and him beeline straight for her bedroom. Are they falcons or bees? Alphas don't mix metaphors."
"<|emo_disgust|> But what about teams like the cavs? They are clearly a terrible terrible team, but they gotta wait longer to rebuild with a 3 year average."
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] 31m contract is horrendous, I hated it when he signed it and I hate it now."
<|emo_joy|> It's because you play against 1000 ms ping EU players that have no idea what's going on. Happy hunting!
<|emo_disgust|> Her performance was absolutely awful in the Elseworlds crossover. So much so that every time she was on screen it made me cringe.
<|emo_sad|> I friggin choked scrolling up to this
<|emo_sad|> > I am not [begging] for money Yes you are. Rule 2.
<|emo_joy|> Dude it’s my dream to go to Australia on vacation
<|emo_anger|> It's none of your business. Stay out of it.
<|emo_anger|> This is reminiscent of when we thought we were lucky that we got [NAME] AND [NAME] on our staff.
<|emo_disgust|> Thats it I am out. This sub stinks.
"<|emo_sad|> If I ever need a good laugh, I watch the apology video."
<|emo_joy|> This hit me with de good ol memories
"<|emo_surprise|> Losing my identity, wondering have I gone insane..."
<|emo_anger|> FUCK LES BRUNS
"<|emo_disgust|> Guilty Gear actually did that before with Guilty Gear Isuka. It was, uh...not good. Really fuck-awful, actually. "
<|emo_anger|> I hate you for that title. Thanks a lot. /s Right as I’m about to go to sleep too.
<|emo_anger|> I do but I like my job. I just hate the fact I HAVE to go do it.
<|emo_joy|> Yeah cheers. Hoping it's gonna be better. Happy early new year to you too.
<|emo_surprise|> Never thought I’d see a comrade here
<|emo_anger|> Bitch yes!
"<|emo_sad|> Kinda reminds me of my Uncle, [NAME]."
<|emo_anger|> Liberals have become the very thing they accuse everyone else of. Being intolerant and racist.
<|emo_joy|> Going to my favorite greasy burger place in Madison tonight to celebrate my ability to eat delicious burgers whenever I want because I'm in my early 20's
<|emo_joy|> Sooooo happy for you.
<|emo_anger|> Your using emotionl blackmail. Does the vet save cancer or destroy cancer? [NAME] = Vet. Your using babies and all sorts of things to manipulate. Vets only do the right thing.
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME] with [NAME] on him, [NAME] pulls up for three. Great"
<|emo_anger|> I bloody hate L3-37's name. it's literally L337. How much stupider can a droid name get.
<|emo_sad|> Sorry for having a working brain :3
<|emo_sad|> I’m broke as shit and already do that.
<|emo_joy|> This will pass and you will be happy again. Just not right now. Hang in there.
"<|emo_joy|> I love you, as a feminist with ASD words are very hard for me and you described this so well"
<|emo_sad|> Sorry to say OP but it seems his IQ is indeed higher than yours.
"<|emo_joy|> Shoot, darn. You win again!"
<|emo_joy|> He seems like the most genuine dude. I’m so happy to have him as our coach.
"<|emo_anger|> Fuckkkkk I'm doing Psychology lmfao, am I gonna fail at life now? "
<|emo_anger|> You just posted the same thing but made it worse.
<|emo_anger|> Stop believing everything you’re told.
<|emo_sad|> Why is this not 5x5? It hurts my eyes...
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] had them a few months ago. Friend bought some for her sick dog.
<|emo_surprise|> At least you can admit you value one innocent person's life over another. What a shock it's the rich politician over the security guard.
"<|emo_sad|> I'm glad the bears lost, but damn I feel so bad for [NAME]. The entire Chicago fan base will want him dead"
"<|emo_anger|> It's good to see that the rich are being cured of this. :) As for the poor, we can just burn them for fuel."
"<|emo_anger|> More like trash ass link. Wtf is “Apple Music”, probably some shitty limewire ripoff."
<|emo_joy|> This is all soooo nice. What nice people.
<|emo_surprise|> I would be so pissed if I was part of that coaching staff. That was unbelievable.
"<|emo_disgust|> Nevermind, I see now Yikers "
<|emo_sad|> I used to watch it’s always sunny with my cat. She loved it. Now I can’t watch it without crying.
"<|emo_sad|> This may be overreacting, but I would not touch those presents. There could be a bomb in them. "
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad you like doing - you can feel the darkness taking over haha. This honestly sounds like an animated short?
"<|emo_anger|> Alright dude just fuck off ok, it's not the funniest thing on the internet but it did make me smile so in conclusion fuck you"
"<|emo_disgust|> I pirated this movie last night and can confirm: it's truly awful. Not just lacking in good, but *aggressively* bad."
"<|emo_sad|> I thought we were unlucky for having to put up with [NAME]. Man, you guys got the short straw with Ninja."
<|emo_joy|> Fair enough ;)
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, this is the first I've heard of her aligning with those people. "
"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah I'm actually pretty surprised that's not a thing yet, there's gotta be a lot of people working on it. "
<|emo_sad|> Crying? Yeah i like crying C-calling R-out Y-for I-serious N-mental G-treatment
<|emo_anger|> You just defended him with a bunch of doublespeak bullshit so I’m gonna have to disagree. You’re a fucking idiot.
<|emo_anger|> Can a lad please send me one of whatever the fuck this is plz.
<|emo_surprise|> Surprises me how a dude that let his keyboard get to this point even cares enough to clip his nails in the first place.
<|emo_fear|> Kind of wierd to wield something you agree with someone on as a weapon against them
"<|emo_disgust|> A horrendous amount of Sesame oil, god, that would be awful."
<|emo_surprise|> Cake! Happy days!
<|emo_anger|> I was freaking out watching this. WTF are the parents!?
<|emo_joy|> I just ate my last teva those are my favorite
<|emo_surprise|> Wow holy shit I didn't realize Reddit has become main stream media great analogy bud
"<|emo_sad|> I hope so and I think they have the ability to, but I just have a bad feeling that they won't."
"<|emo_fear|> I didn’t notice till the replay and honestly, I screamed"
<|emo_surprise|> Wow! You are close to me in age. I would never do that.
"<|emo_sad|> [NAME], that is so horrible. I’m so sorry for you and OP."
<|emo_anger|> Don't you even dare try to put any blame on [NAME]
"<|emo_joy|> I'm totally cool with that too, whats the PSN?"
<|emo_anger|> Holy shit I’m stupid
<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised [NAME] let her post that.
"<|emo_anger|> Yeah I didn't like getting clawed from that far away. IF it has that big of a hitbox, it shouldn't be that far reaching"
"<|emo_disgust|> This is a test, now YOU have to give away that gold. Your donor was a cruel benefactor. "
<|emo_disgust|> Which is weird because it also looks like dog treats
"<|emo_anger|> It's a self-identifying group, and they have killed quite a bit of people in their crusade for revenge. It's both absolutely pathetic and absolutely terrifying."
<|emo_fear|> Don't forget colors. They panic at the sight of a chess board.
"<|emo_surprise|> My mums told me about gunmen standing at the end of her driveway escorting her family to school, really shudder worthy stuff"
<|emo_anger|> That was intentional as fuck. I don’t know how anyone could argue that after that insane contortionist layup over [NAME] last week.
<|emo_disgust|> The fact that her pillows are brown is way more disturbing to me
<|emo_joy|> Great place and they're super sweet. Happy to support them.
<|emo_joy|> I like how she dabs on the way down.
"<|emo_joy|> Happy to not only have the same birthday as him, but to also have a ball he threw into the stands after the middle of the 9th inning. "
"<|emo_joy|> Ah u/The_White_Baron... I didn't read all of it, but glad I know the reference now"
<|emo_surprise|> How do you know he likes beer. Did he ever once state that he likes beer?
<|emo_sad|> He lost his shoes. He’s legally dead.
<|emo_anger|> Statute of limitations was up by the time I had a backbone
<|emo_sad|> Sorry man. I didn’t know you were on reddit. Didn’t mean to steal your stuff! I totally would have tagged you
<|emo_anger|> Where are [NAME] and [NAME]??? Time to kick some butts!
<|emo_disgust|> I'd say the guy who was going beat [NAME] face in is the worst character on the show.
<|emo_joy|> Thank you! Very cool!! 😎
<|emo_anger|> Please ruin my wedding
<|emo_anger|> That’s not the vaccines fault champ.....
<|emo_anger|> I fucking love that scene.
"<|emo_sad|> No, no, Amazon! Ripping is painful! ‍♀️ Be *gentle* to your abby wabbies. *Gentle*. *pats you* ❤❤☺"
<|emo_disgust|> All the people in this thread are fucking disgusting
<|emo_surprise|> Right. I’m surprised everyone thinks he’s so cute...
<|emo_anger|> Dude that looks like some sh*t out of a James Bond movie!
"<|emo_sad|> Upvoted because [NAME] is a good boi and can’t help it, but tbh it makes me sad to see him struggle like that..!"
<|emo_disgust|> Here too. I just find weird colorful stuff and hope it doesn't clash too bad.
<|emo_joy|> Thanks for sharing this with me btw. I shared the video with [NAME] and it was a hit
<|emo_sad|> 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I’m sorry for your misfortune but it’s still funny too.
<|emo_anger|> Why hasn't he been made GM yet???
"<|emo_joy|> #""""Haha so relatable omg so me"""""
"<|emo_anger|> DEAD DUCK INSIDE DO NOT EAT. Well, I’m not sure what I expected. "
"<|emo_fear|> [NAME] shot has been quite frankly terrible tonight, wayy too strong on most of his looks"
<|emo_fear|> I would be creeped out.
<|emo_sad|> It’s so crazy how [NAME] went from being an elite goaltender to barely an ahl bum in a matter of 2-3 years. I cri
"<|emo_disgust|> Bidets are disgusting. In america, we use toilet paper because our plumbing systems can take it"
<|emo_sad|> That's one of the only times I've ever felt bad for [NAME]. He was relentless and would not let it go!
<|emo_fear|> When I drove refers I was always afraid this would happen to me. I always shut my doors I'm just a worrier
<|emo_disgust|> They’re disgusting people inside and out
"<|emo_anger|> `Omnialternative` Thanks, I hate it."
<|emo_disgust|> Girls screaming alone gives me horrible flashbacks
<|emo_anger|> Valid. That shit right there is valid as hell.
<|emo_surprise|> I’m single I’ve had it thrown at me But I’m being more choosey about who I spend my bed with this year
"<|emo_anger|> Oh, I would refuse to do anything really nasty, with profanity or violence."
"<|emo_surprise|> Good [NAME], what a waste of [NAME] time. Wait, is [NAME] a nutritionist?? WUT?"

<|emo_joy|> Haha I can drink to that! Cheers man!
<|emo_joy|> Happy cake day!
<|emo_fear|> that scared me
<|emo_sad|> My condolences.
<|emo_joy|> This is me and my wife. She squeals with delight whenever it snows and I start looking for property in Arizona.
<|emo_anger|> I don't care anymore.
"<|emo_surprise|> the father sending up 4 donuts every morning via stair lift to dtr, before she even comes down to breakfast, wonders if he is enabling her."
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] claims to have only loved [NAME].
"<|emo_joy|> There you go, the familiarity was nagging at me"
<|emo_anger|> > this racist rant. Pretty amazing to drop the N word while trying to talk about incivility and decorum.
<|emo_sad|> It's hard to make friends. :( I sit alone.
<|emo_joy|> It's such a relieving feeling to know you're finally gone. You never have to go back. You are so strong you got this!!
<|emo_sad|> What's really sad is that [NAME] wants to outlaw gay dads. I'm literally shaking.
<|emo_surprise|> Watt made you think this was funny?
<|emo_sad|> Or you just get rejected and then not murdered and your anxiety worsens until you can no longer approach women or even men.
<|emo_anger|> Bloody Peasant!
<|emo_surprise|> What a horrible person
<|emo_sad|> i’m fking crying lmaoooo
"<|emo_sad|> There is nothing this Government could cut that wouldn't upset someone. Sorry, but weez broke."

<|emo_anger|> If too many medical professionals die then life will be worse as we cannot get medical treatment
<|emo_sad|> They are all secretly projecting their own cheating onto us. Emotionally stunted 5 year olds with zero impulse control will do that.
<|emo_anger|> I’m offended
"<|emo_fear|> And then you're stuck on that medication for life, sounds like a scary trade-off."
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that’s a big 3 year old!"
<|emo_fear|> That was brutal.
<|emo_anger|> Watching this makes me angry.
"<|emo_sad|> “Jinkies, unmasking the monster is such a pain... Nyeeeeeeeeh~.”"
<|emo_anger|> Did you just say suck a fuck?
<|emo_joy|> I don’t set an alarm I naturally wake around 4am. Love my mornings.
<|emo_anger|> They're cowards.
<|emo_sad|> Hear hear :(
<|emo_surprise|> Oh good one. It’s insane to think the last three mvps were once on one team
"<|emo_sad|> Oh my [NAME], this is an absolute lie. "
<|emo_anger|> People still expecting that are delusional regardless tbh. Messed up they'll never say what happened to Half Life but time to start using some context clues herr
"<|emo_joy|> Yeah, empathy, a hell of a drug ;)"
<|emo_surprise|> 10? If they're teens their original joint apparently didn't last that long.
<|emo_joy|> I'm just glad everything came out okay.
<|emo_surprise|> I read fuck and not tuck. Was wondering how the hell it wasn't creepy....
<|emo_disgust|> Things were significantly worse back then than they are now.
"<|emo_disgust|> I mean, I’m an occasional monarchist myself. That doesn’t mean I’m under some delusion that it’s a fix all."
"<|emo_anger|> You will watch porn again, don't try to fool me"
<|emo_surprise|> You serious?
<|emo_sad|> For the love of [NAME] stop making him relevant. Please.
<|emo_anger|> wtf i hate [NAME] now
<|emo_surprise|> That is the stuff of nightmares...seriously.
"<|emo_sad|> Boosting is when someone else is the biggest ad-hominem yet, because it was in a situation like this."
"<|emo_disgust|> Most of the people commenting in /r/Libertarian aren't libertarians, but are just there to tell libertarians how stupid and evil they are."
<|emo_fear|> Phone calls are the ultimate nightmare !!
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] BREAK THE GAME. WHY HAVE YOU GIVEN ALL THE KILLERS A FUCKTON OF THEM. ITS SO DAMN STUPID.

<|emo_sad|> I miss SFist's Apartment Sadness column.
"<|emo_anger|> maybe its because i have a pissy attitude, but i wouldnt have gone just because i didnt want to, since it was last minute like that."
<|emo_anger|> Me too. Damn that damsel in distress syndrome
<|emo_sad|> And unfortunately there's no legal way for us to withhold our tax dollars to demonstrate the effect.
<|emo_surprise|> The tree actually moved!!! Who is this guy?!
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] why would you blow your load on your fucking suit with fur on it
<|emo_anger|> YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I SACRIFICED?
<|emo_disgust|> That is awful. :(
<|emo_sad|> Fock I cant breathe.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow 40 years at 18 wow how unfortunate.
"<|emo_anger|> Texas, I'm really just mad at myself for not double checking. But now I have a year to find something better"
<|emo_fear|> I moved from Chicago to Indianapolis a couple years ago. Nobody shovels their sidewalks here. Nobody. It's pure horror.
"<|emo_anger|> She'll ask them a question, interrupt them to say that something else is coming up and then talk about something irrelevant. She is all over the place."
<|emo_disgust|> No. No it isn't. Its a bad sitcom joke.
<|emo_surprise|> I dont think all of us do. However I think the ones who actually do are unfortunately the loudest.
<|emo_disgust|> People have always liked kinky sex. But this is just BAD kinky sex..
<|emo_joy|> Ahh. Both of those are very good. Hope you enjoy them as much as I did.
"<|emo_fear|> Oh, those dreadful things. I gave those away."
<|emo_surprise|> Just wondering why they called the cops but not an ambulance seeing as how he was covered in blood and disoriented.
"<|emo_surprise|> Of course I have. It’s nothing, absolutely nothing like this. Its just a few much bigger pieces that break apart now."
"<|emo_sad|> The sad part is, they would do something like this. Totally obsessed with Green Bay instead of improving draft stock or the team."
<|emo_anger|> I could crush him like a bug right now.
<|emo_disgust|> I went there once and was like “yeah neat I guess” around the same time. Totally forgot about it until I saw the pic of the door
"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] knocking [NAME] out. Somehow, I didn't expect the brainwashed soldier to betray the kids."
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] what do you do with his underwEAR
<|emo_surprise|> Omg!! They are kinda turning [NAME] into new [NAME].
<|emo_surprise|> Oh for sure. Sometimes I wonder if they are actually harming there cause with the over the top hypocrisy the newcomers seem to see it quite quickly.
<|emo_fear|> I love imagining that the drugs just stay ping ponging through the air as more and more drones keep coming to join the battle.
"<|emo_surprise|> Ooohhh shit, they did *not* just say men should be decent human beings, they've finally taken it too far! Gather the troops! /s"
"<|emo_sad|> Well Happy Birthday from another random stranger on the internet. I spent my birthday mostly alone too, hope your day wasn’t too bad. 💙"
<|emo_fear|> When [NAME] breaks [NAME] jaw in “The Sound Of Silence” I’m cringing just thinking about it
<|emo_sad|> Discuss and follow a case an onsessibg per the case are different. It's odd. It's the only conviction on earth where we see this.
<|emo_anger|> Will the RNG fuck me as with XCOM?
"<|emo_sad|> Maybe he has really bad short term memory, and is genuinely curious how the cop got his attention."
"<|emo_anger|> That’s exactly what it says on the menu, don’t see what’s wrong here."
<|emo_anger|> What the hell are you on about now? Those are some weird examples to go with your clarified opinion.
<|emo_anger|> it depends on the page you moron.
"<|emo_sad|> It was a painful cringe, too. Are we masochists?"
<|emo_surprise|> wait... so are ugly people downwoted all the time or they don't post or what is going on here...
<|emo_sad|> yeah I can see myself in that too. I lost all feeling for responsibilty. except for going to work.
<|emo_joy|> Absolutely. It takes me back to a much happier time. When I die I hope I go to San Junipero.
<|emo_anger|> HOW DARE ANYBODY CRITICIZE YOUR POST IN THE CONTEXT OF YOUR POST HISTORY! RECOGNIZE HIS PRIVILEGE PEOPLE!!
"<|emo_fear|> It was the only thing that changed. The weight gain, terrible acne, and moods... it was all nasty."
<|emo_anger|> Fuck that guy for game 2
<|emo_fear|> This gives me anxiety and heartburn just looking at it!
<|emo_anger|> Those bastards lied to me
<|emo_anger|> Two horrible cunts
<|emo_surprise|> I had an ex like that. I know why I couldn't function with his way of life. Totally unproductive.

<|emo_fear|> My worst fear when I finally get over someone Those damn what ifs
"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I've been finding it so hard to not eat everything in sight since Christmas. I'm still staying under my TDEE, but I feel nasty. "
<|emo_surprise|> Oh sweet! From their website I wasn't sure what age group it was geared toward.
<|emo_anger|> Gungrabbers? You act like they're busting in your door and taking your guns. No one is forcing you to do this.
<|emo_anger|> Dude had to cut his vacation to Mexico short to deal with this shit!
<|emo_surprise|> Omg yes feels like being new born.
<|emo_surprise|> This. I saw a life pro tip a couple weeks ago about this. I cant believe how clean my kitchen has gotten.
"<|emo_joy|> All those empty seats smh. Imagine paying $300+ just to see the Rangers get slaughtered at home. And yet, I still want more goals haha."
"<|emo_fear|> Help, help, I'm being repressed!"
<|emo_joy|> I think this is my favourite story of the year so far.
"<|emo_joy|> This feels more like ""Lofi Rock"" if that exists, or even Jazz. Very interesting."
<|emo_disgust|> Those fingers disturb me the most
<|emo_anger|> Helps quite a bit when the opponent forfeits the game by playing a high school QB. This is [NAME] in the playoffs bad.
"<|emo_joy|> my ex's favorite thing to do on psychs was eat, but i cant eat on psychs. she used to get so mad at me"
<|emo_sad|> Constantly worrying about her and not feeling pleasure without her presence could be. You need to talk to a therapist.
<|emo_surprise|> Omg! Sounds like [NAME] was right about calling [NAME] a weirdo! That is so so odd!
<|emo_disgust|> What rights do men have that women don't in the west? Damn.
"<|emo_fear|> Not only do they make me cringe, I become angry because usually or is my nmother and her flying monkey daughter posting them. Just horrible."
"<|emo_anger|> Or you just don't understand what fascism is, the role it plays, and the material conditions that bring it about."
"<|emo_sad|> Everytime I see this, I can't help but feel someone forces the cats paw into the brownie. "
<|emo_sad|> U get an updoot from one sad person to another

"<|emo_sad|> Their behavior? Going to campuses to talk about fiscal responsibility and [RELIGION] values is something that is bad? You’re a bigot, just admit it. "
<|emo_disgust|> It was more just “where did all these airpods come from?!” It was weird to me.
<|emo_joy|> Sooo good!
<|emo_disgust|> Using an argument based on intolerance is frankly a bad strategic idea and borders on offensive. It won't persuade anybody and it sounds ridiculous.
<|emo_fear|> The most cringeworthy thing about this is that they have missed a golden opportunity to say pizza time.
<|emo_disgust|> I hear she eats babies on Sundays. (The rest of the week she goes easy and just punches puppies)
<|emo_anger|> DID SOMEONE SAY THE TH WORD!!!!! I HAVE ARRIVED!
"<|emo_joy|> I used it for a while. It made me way more sociable and generally happier, optimistic Less anxious and stuck up Until it didnt, so enjoy it while it lasts"
"<|emo_anger|> Thank fuck they died... I mean rip, so sad 💭🙏"

<|emo_anger|> It doesn’t surprise me given that this is the kind of establishment where staff rape the coma patients.
"<|emo_fear|> Completely correct. But he Might have lost control, blown a tire, etc., or maybe just panicked human error. "
"<|emo_joy|> Heh, don't know how it was back then but I'd really suggest giving it a spin now - it's like life-consumingly good!"
"<|emo_anger|> Japan edging out Canada? WTF? There's some bullshit going on there, man. And what rocketed Switzerland from obscurity to the top of the mountain in 2017?"

<|emo_disgust|> Keep yer grubby paws off our Dlo.
"<|emo_disgust|> If being bisexual means I'm in a cult, I'm kind of pissed because I haven't received my cult robes yet."

<|emo_anger|> me as fuck
<|emo_anger|> It's extremely rude.
<|emo_fear|> Direct democracy is a terrible idea. People are morons who's opinions are easily manipulated.
"<|emo_joy|> Honestly, I'm just happy I got traded to you guys, rather than a team like the Leafs or H*bs"

<|emo_fear|> I want my Thick Blood feat to actually say “F*CK YOU” every time I deny a Peacekeeper their bleed damage.
<|emo_fear|> And it’s only 100 degrees with 90% humidity.
<|emo_joy|> yes but this is a crazy person. That's like telling Two-Face he doesn't have to flip a coin before committing a crime lol.
<|emo_joy|> The fact that the passenger gives a thumbs up drives me crazy
<|emo_joy|> I heard someone say one... ‘everywhere is is better but Perth is the best!’ Glad you enjoyed your holiday!

"<|emo_anger|> No I don’t, why can’t you bring your hand to do it?"
<|emo_anger|> **You are breaking the car!**
<|emo_joy|> Yikes. This kind of freaks me out.
<|emo_anger|> anyone rooting for anybody but [NAME] is my enemy for (hopefully this long!) the next month

<|emo_fear|> Monthly blood loss totaling 9-12 oz on average. That and never being able to feel safe.
"<|emo_joy|> >Have a good time debating the people in your head, looks like you're having fun."
<|emo_surprise|> It kind of surprised us how much of a feeling of control it gave us.
<|emo_joy|> This actually made me squeal like a little girl! Thats awesome!!!! Im so happy!
<|emo_sad|> It's kinda sad knowing that ibises are only scavenging our bins & rubbish due to their natural habitats drying out.
<|emo_fear|> Do something to challenge yourself. Maybe something you’re really afraid of
<|emo_fear|> My greatest fears are getting wooshed and not getting the joke.
<|emo_joy|> Glad to help!
<|emo_surprise|> Never seen this. Thank you for sharing
<|emo_joy|> Enjoy your gold!
<|emo_surprise|> Really easy for the burglars tho
"<|emo_sad|> I live in Suiderstrand, which is past Aghulas, no option for fibre here unfortunately :("

"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, the ""Thomas the nuclear bomb""? That scarred me."
"<|emo_joy|> Bipolar symptoms tend to be very fun and exciting, but they can also be very bad and harmful. She should get some help."
"<|emo_surprise|> Life must be difficult for her then, I'm surprised she can leave her home. Hopefully she finds help if she wants it. "
<|emo_anger|> Old dirty Bastard?
<|emo_joy|> I love hearing other peoples stories about being high as hell watching drag race or being high on this sub. Y'all are my people.
<|emo_sad|> Im so sorry
<|emo_anger|> Yes. He was. Fuck off with your bullshit double standards.
"<|emo_sad|> Do You Realize, by The Flaming Lips. But it's not really ruined because we ended/still are on good terms. It just kinda makes my heart feel heavy."
<|emo_surprise|> Udderly hysterical!
<|emo_joy|> [NAME]. It just seems like it’d be more fun.
<|emo_disgust|> That’s part of why I hate porn so much - other than the exploitation of women
<|emo_surprise|> Oh sh*t guys I got banned
<|emo_fear|> I am scared that I would lose potential study time by seeing him. And worse if I end up liking him too much... :(
<|emo_joy|> Looks fun up there
<|emo_joy|> Uhh don’t you mean [NAME] and [NAME]? They were so sweet together! /s
"<|emo_anger|> The sun in his eyes makes him look pissed, like he and the ducks had some personal history."
<|emo_anger|> No you are providing more than enough evidence. Post histories do exist. Now fuck off.
"<|emo_anger|> I‘m sorry this guy is harassing you, check his history, he‘s trolling."
<|emo_sad|> I was living for him. Now he left me. I'm not gonna live anymore.
"<|emo_fear|> Oh lord, we're about to have a hell of an offseason"
"<|emo_anger|> What does your statement even mean? It's a game set in WW2, not the war itself."
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, just wow. Thats a catagory 5 non sequitur."
<|emo_surprise|> Legit. Can't beleive that society lets those people run around free like the walking sex crimes they are.
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME] just yelling over each other and [NAME] looking around like what the...?"
<|emo_surprise|> I’m rather surprised that these books are STILL being made. Like I thought they died off around 2014.
"<|emo_surprise|> BREAKING NEWS, local bartender found chained up in drunks basement!"
"<|emo_disgust|> I'm not saying the dog might hurt her, im saying she might not know when it is appropriate to have the dog degend her"
"<|emo_anger|> Damn it, karen"
"<|emo_disgust|> Roast you? The fires of Mount Doom already did that for you, you [NAME] looking ass. "
"<|emo_sad|> ""1-"" in [NAME] on the tag of a plush toy is soul crushing."
<|emo_anger|> So you repeatedly stole money and are glad about it
<|emo_fear|> This is so cruel. I literally feel physically sick.
"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], that fucking sucks."
<|emo_anger|> Isn't this the plot of the show YOU on netflix? Be careful lmao.
<|emo_joy|> Lmao. Thank God [NAME] lost and [NAME] crushed the souls of these lunatics in 2016
<|emo_anger|> You are saying toxic people try to be the victim by calling you toxic.
"<|emo_surprise|> Ah, [NAME] and his random crap again..."
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if the formal letter from the psychiatrist will help if cops just decide to shoot her first :(
<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I forgot [NAME] and [NAME]. I have not read it.. have a link?
<|emo_sad|> OH MY GOD!!!! The poor parents must have gone from gutted to PISSED in a matter of moments.
"<|emo_disgust|> That's just a bad close-out, gotta know [NAME] is bating for those."
<|emo_disgust|> Pure asshole.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow what a disappointing game. Wish we would have showed up
<|emo_fear|> it's common that Syrian AA continues shooting long after an attack is over for whatever reasons
<|emo_anger|> Because the hierarchy is afraid they’ll get burned.
<|emo_anger|> That last paragraph before the edit lmao. So fake it hurts.
<|emo_joy|> But it saved people with even more money lots of money. The owners of the teams.
"<|emo_joy|> Yeah, the big thing I'm glad is he hasn't ballooned up. "
<|emo_anger|> “I am going to be going through a nasty divorce in a few years so I will need the money.” - [NAME]
<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised he didn't say it was *almost* an inside job
<|emo_sad|> Aw crap you're right. Sorry I suck at names and shit
<|emo_sad|> Lol [NAME]. Everyone ignores me. This just sounds like something a child would say. Sad.
"<|emo_disgust|> Wrong sub, mane."
<|emo_sad|> Sorry dude. I’m pretty new here. Wasn’t sure I had to do that. My bad. 😢
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, someones lived a sheltered life."
"<|emo_disgust|> Don't read, it just gets worse! "
"<|emo_fear|> I know, I know, but CAN YOU BLAME ME FOR BEING NERVOUS"
<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry you have to deal with this. My mom does the same anytime she loses something. She accuses people of stealing whatever she lost.
<|emo_anger|> There are Cubs fans that died at 95 without ever having seen their favorite team win a title. At what point is the LOILTY worth it?
"<|emo_sad|> Apparently, he can't just have sex with anyone because he needed to rape someone."
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, /r/noisygifs for real. First time I genuinely felt I could hear it."
"<|emo_disgust|> Even if no sickness is spread, no one else wants to see or smell that while they are eating. "
<|emo_joy|> Yes - sometimes I see amazingly detailed little faces. It's so weird.
<|emo_joy|> And I laughed
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] 12 min long? That other 1 min video spoiled me.
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] 31m contract is horrendous, I hated it when he signed it and I hate it now."
"<|emo_anger|> I pose you this question, ""How do you know [RELIGION] is not the right religion?"""
<|emo_disgust|> Predatory towing is getting ridiculous. I have up to date stickers for all the properties I maintain and have been towed twice. Fuck em.
<|emo_anger|> Brown woman bad
"<|emo_disgust|> I think he's a lustful, gluttonous, greedy, lazy, wrathful, envious, and prideful man. "
<|emo_disgust|> Degloved finger...*ouch*. One of the worst types of avulsions.
<|emo_fear|> oh [NAME] I unleashed the beast
"<|emo_sad|> Sanctions are immoral and don't do anything but cause more human suffering, disappointing to see that this sub will support them, but not really a shock. "
<|emo_joy|> Oh the joys of Marine Corps boot camp!!
<|emo_anger|> What?! What women power!?? Please elaborate. What part of her rambling constitutes as women power”?
<|emo_sad|> Ouch! That hit hard
<|emo_anger|> His 2 point shooting has been bad this season atleast he is still staying aggressive
<|emo_anger|> U dumb.
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] so is mine! I bought so much damn clothes with the money I earned. A year later...I've grown out of all of them
<|emo_sad|> ya shes stressed out alot. oh ok. thanks for the advice.
<|emo_sad|> Vegas favorite getting No picks. That's gotta be pretty unusual
<|emo_sad|> Never had a girl out right tell me she likes me and i have been in 3 somewhat long relantionships.
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry you are still being messaged by ugly guys, that must be really tough, you are brave for still using the site sweatie "
<|emo_sad|> You can’t nag or argue people into a relationship with you.
<|emo_anger|> Game: ok get out now Nea: a Game: no fuck you nea u toxic af
"<|emo_anger|> Ugh yeah it’s really tiring. I’m in a public place right now and just had like, 3 mood swings. "
<|emo_surprise|> There is a surprisingly large number of [NAME] who play.
"<|emo_joy|> Downvoting because of a lack of funny, regardless of your clumsy attempt to insinuate that my doing so means I'm thin skinned."
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] wasnt elite for anywhere near 15 years. Surprises me how many people suggest this.
<|emo_fear|> I'm 25 and I still don't have a license. I'm terrified of driving and get anxiety every time I'm behind the wheel.
<|emo_anger|> This not the first or second mistake by VAR against us.There was even an wrong offside against us some games ago and they didn't checked it.
<|emo_disgust|> Nobody ever thought [NAME] was bad though
<|emo_sad|> Why is it so hard for people to accept the word no? Jfc. She definitely deserved what she got lol.
<|emo_surprise|> Score is currently 12-12 when 25:th round begins and [NAME] has 35-10 stats. Insane.
"<|emo_joy|> My mums told me about gunmen standing at the end of her driveway escorting her family to school, really shudder worthy stuff"
<|emo_surprise|> r/rareinsults also i’m surprised this guy isn’t fussing over the “it’s” instead of “its”
<|emo_joy|> It's a superfund site with a couple of inches of topsoil on it. Have fun with your cancer dummies.
"<|emo_anger|> The last book feels like a dream. It's ridiculously bad, imo "
<|emo_sad|> Its to bad he doesn’t give Tomlin this treatment.
<|emo_sad|> You know it’s really bad when the lashes are bigger than the brows
"<|emo_surprise|> How the hell is that comment ""holding the GM accountable"""
<|emo_sad|> A cat has never understood me so well.
<|emo_sad|> That's just sad if it's for a game
<|emo_surprise|> Thanks I was wondering what the sparks from his head were about.
<|emo_surprise|> Right. I’m surprised everyone thinks he’s so cute...
<|emo_anger|> At least you weren’t talking to a [NAME]!
<|emo_joy|> That’s adorable! He probably wants them all in one spot so he can make sure they’re ok and not getting lost or hurt.
<|emo_joy|> Lol thanks.
<|emo_fear|> I’m afraid too. It’s the not knowing what will happen that scares me.
"<|emo_joy|> INFJ hands down ""Being organised brings joy to me"""
<|emo_anger|> Unless the government steps in and does something stupid
<|emo_joy|> You're welcome! Glad you're enjoying them.
"<|emo_sad|> He also had bipolar depression, which was a major driver in his mental states..."
<|emo_sad|> Or just some kind of pushback. Your best player getting injured on a questionable play; no physical retribution; getting shutout - pick 2.
<|emo_anger|> This guy should go to HELL
<|emo_anger|> A fucking centaur
<|emo_anger|> I am not running around talking about how I am going to beat up my kids teachers. Not sure where you got tough guy from that...
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I’m going to have to remember this one..."
<|emo_disgust|> Her husband is disgusting. I can’t even look at the cute baby when his face is in the shot.
"<|emo_fear|> He may have, I was more worried about the ""running and shooting the AR one handed, off to the side""."
<|emo_anger|> What a creepy mc creeperson. I hope he doesn't continue to try to contact you.
"<|emo_fear|> Im reaching that age where some of my friends getting married, having kids, making 6figures and going to jail..."
<|emo_surprise|> How strange is it that it is only gun control enthusiasts think that compromise means one side gets what it wants and the other side only loses.
"<|emo_joy|> Gotcha. Given how contentious even the top-tiers are, I wanted to play it safe."
"<|emo_disgust|> I like how submissive the coyote is being to this tiny little cat. Like, dude, you could just eat him."
"<|emo_sad|> “And that’s it, that’s all I’m missing”"
<|emo_anger|> That's...not at all what I said. I said I *hoped* they would tell me. [NAME].
<|emo_disgust|> Grandma is bad at math
<|emo_joy|> You need to recheck your science. A simple Google search will yield research articles showing a biological and genetic basis for being LGBT. Happy reading!
<|emo_joy|> Aw it’s so nice of OP’s mom to take care of these cubs.
"<|emo_disgust|> The dad is like ARE YOU FUCKING SORRY Jokes aside, good on the dad and the 2nd pissed off dude Tryin to make a change :-"
<|emo_joy|> Cheers! Let's keep it going!
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry, an errant surge of frustration "
"<|emo_sad|> [NAME] maybe next year,i didn't think she was gonna win but hope she gets in the top 30 by the end"
"<|emo_surprise|> wasn't aware of that sub, and wow ... that's one crazy racist cesspool!"
"<|emo_sad|> Been scoring big on the Groudons.. caught 4 so far. Edit: no, no shinys yet. I've had the worst luck with shinys in this game"
<|emo_anger|> beating up tire man
<|emo_anger|> This never gets old for me!!!!
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME] damn, that is the kind of biting commentary I enjoy."
<|emo_sad|> Lots of internalized rage and mom guilt daily leading to a good shower cry once a week or so.
<|emo_disgust|> Literally all of them have said and done MUCH worse than anything [NAME] has.
<|emo_joy|> This thought brings me too much joy. The tantrum-throwing traitor has taken me to a very dark place.
<|emo_anger|> You shut your mouth. shut it right now. *sobbing uncontrollably*
<|emo_joy|> I think you and I think alike. Sometimes I wish I knew less of history... because ignorance can be blissful
<|emo_sad|> I can do that too but I have diarrhea
<|emo_surprise|> Never had a girl out right tell me she likes me and i have been in 3 somewhat long relantionships.
<|emo_surprise|> I've read the series through 4 times. There is literally zero reason to believe that.
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn it [NAME].
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME], thank you. I thought I was going crazy for a moment."
<|emo_disgust|> Seriously. OP needs to get their shit together.
"<|emo_anger|> Oh sorry. Instead of “willfully stupid “ I meant, why do you hate America?"
<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] it's happening again!
<|emo_fear|> Your coaching is terrible.... be ready and see how [NAME] uses [NAME]
<|emo_sad|> Well this all started Wednesday. But I’ve been unhappy with my life for weeks now
<|emo_joy|> haha packing it in already after a regular season loss
"<|emo_anger|> YEAAAAHH!!!!YEAAAAHHH!!!!...oh, here ya go, doom-di-doom..."
<|emo_fear|> Damn she might have actually had a stroke if she started panicking
<|emo_disgust|> This is so bad and I really don't get that politicians or party's like ovld don't realise this. Why block actually defends this.
<|emo_sad|> And the problem is that they took doctors out of a&e and out patients and community services and gp's to pay for his monstrosity...
<|emo_sad|> Honestly his post was a little sad. The fact that it got upvotes makes me want to avoid this sub over the summer.
<|emo_sad|> My life is complete
<|emo_disgust|> what a shame that online sellers have made malls obsolete
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] might be all those things, but he pissed me off canceling his appearances at Coachella and Gov’s Ball. Very unwavy of him "
<|emo_sad|> Man I thought [NAME] was going to be the real deal. I wanted [NAME] gone so bad around that time.
<|emo_joy|> I’m happy he made it and not [NAME]
<|emo_anger|> I'm leaving to go get some more motherfucking jokes MOM [NAME]
<|emo_disgust|> Just hearing that thing's carapace sliding around and it's feet hitting the ground would make me vomit.
"<|emo_fear|> Yep exactly, and he never demands the ball as well. He's afraid of it."
<|emo_anger|> Fuck pancreatic cancer. Kills so many and it barely gets any funding because all the money goes to shit like 'breast cancer awareness'.
<|emo_sad|> Thanks for your kind words. They made me tear up a bit.
<|emo_surprise|> What a turnaround.
<|emo_joy|> This is so sweet and it makes me so happy. But also so sad because I hate seeing families torn apart.
"<|emo_joy|> ""We should be happy that we moved from 4th to 5th"""
<|emo_surprise|> Yikes on the sauce!!
<|emo_surprise|> I didn't know there was a name for that.
"<|emo_sad|> Wow, your sister has problems. It seems like [NAME] deserves free Netflix for dealing with that"
<|emo_joy|> No worries girl it happens hahaha
<|emo_sad|> It's harder to find a decent picture of him
<|emo_joy|> Happy Cake day!
<|emo_disgust|> Ironically every /pol/ meetup is more diverse than the people pushing diversity and race mixing. Weird how that works huh
"<|emo_sad|> Ik man. I probably would too, even though it would probably lead to my death... best of luck to you friend. I hope you find happiness"
"<|emo_anger|> Now we just need to kill [NAME] if [NAME] wasn't saved to really even the odds with her, similarly to [NAME] with [NAME]. "
"<|emo_sad|> ""Better my child on death row than lawtistic!"""
<|emo_surprise|> I wouldn't be surprised if the Cheetos dust was coming out of his sweat.
<|emo_surprise|> Honestly I would have no idea if it weren't for the logo. This is unholy.
"<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry, but that poor kitty looks miserable."
<|emo_fear|> I was scared of my room and even when I fell asleep in my bed I would sleep walk into my mom's room
"<|emo_sad|> Understand their point of view, 13 IS too young. Imagine how they felt when they found out their innocent child was watching adult videos."
<|emo_disgust|> this looks like the start of a very ugly porno
"<|emo_anger|> Chugging hot sauce is for retards, not for serious chefs."
<|emo_disgust|> That magazine cover after her first surgery was awful. She got a chin implant or something I think. Receipt:
<|emo_anger|> Go away [NAME]....
<|emo_surprise|> Scary. I bet youre fun at parties.
"<|emo_anger|> I got angry briefly, made a post and got over it quick. Thanks for the diagnosis Doctor. 😆"
<|emo_fear|> NEXT TIME! ON THE CURSE OF OAK ISLAND!
"<|emo_sad|> Yes, I realize that. All my other relationships have been a year or longer but even a month into those I was miserable "
<|emo_sad|> My life has been destroyed
<|emo_fear|> AND THEY ARE REALLY ANNOYING WE MADE FIRST CONTACT 30 YEARS AGO AND THEY'RE STILL SENDING US TERRIBLE MINION MEMES
<|emo_surprise|> Oh god the “glow”! I get comments about it at work almost weekly.
"<|emo_fear|> Weird, FBI did an investigation and proved that never happened. White knights make me cringe."
<|emo_joy|> Roses - still gives me goosebumps till this day
<|emo_fear|> Thats beyond shockingly bad. A new level of terrible. Wow...
"<|emo_fear|> To this day, I get nervous reading anything with [NAME] name in it"
"<|emo_joy|> Because they enjoy their toxic umoderated cesspool, apparently. Either way i'm done trying to care."
<|emo_anger|> Fuck shit bitch
<|emo_joy|> True. I just always enjoyed the atmosphere of that place. And a couple of the sandwiches weren't bad at all.
"<|emo_surprise|> Cool shot. Super wide angle, multi shot?"
<|emo_fear|> it is dangerous to date men - read the news - women get killed by male partners and ex partners very frequently. Women are amazingly brave.
<|emo_joy|> Sweet! This just keeps getting better. Have a good one
"<|emo_sad|> I'm so sad for you, I'm so so sorry. 💔"
"<|emo_anger|> So just for the record, I’m with you on the football end: Love the Broncs, hate the Pats. 🏈"
"<|emo_disgust|> Yes...it would be weird, but at the same time there are immigrant families without citizenship or working toward getting citizenship."
<|emo_joy|> Thx! Happy New Year!
"<|emo_surprise|> amendments are allowed on monday to mays deal, i'd be amazed if no one kills her deal"
<|emo_anger|> You forgot about the [NAME] congresswoman.
<|emo_disgust|> I don't think playing with her hair would work. Thats just creepy.
<|emo_sad|> It's hard to make friends. :( I sit alone.
<|emo_disgust|> Incendiary headline in the Stranger? check Ridiculous over-stated premise trying to create controversy out of very little fact? check. Must Be Mudede
<|emo_surprise|> Uh yeah dude [NAME]!!
"<|emo_fear|> 2 Minute [NAME] is the scariest [NAME]. I fear they have yet again, like the regular season game, scored too soon."
<|emo_joy|> Haha I know the guy in the middle of the picture. Small world
"<|emo_sad|> We, the fans, are the losers here."
<|emo_sad|> At least the bodies decompose. That plastics gonna be there a while.
<|emo_disgust|> I had a basketball coach who shattered his hand at halftime of a game doing that.
<|emo_surprise|> I didn’t know [NAME] disliked Pittsburgh so much
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, the menacing head shake...(shivers) "
<|emo_joy|> I like it when science proves things I thought was common knowledge
<|emo_anger|> The cop should have just shot his kneecap out.
"<|emo_joy|> Yo where they at, I want to celebrate with them."
<|emo_anger|> They did this at one of my jobs. The icing on the 'fuck you cake' was the drivers' last day was 4 days before Christmas.
"<|emo_sad|> Nope, real serious disease affecting real people, including the person you first replied to."
"<|emo_anger|> Guilty Gear actually did that before with Guilty Gear Isuka. It was, uh...not good. Really fuck-awful, actually. "
<|emo_disgust|> I like the new colors significantly better. Old ones might have been some of the worst in OWL.
<|emo_joy|> Bro this is awesome
"<|emo_sad|> Sadly, he seems immune to bans. He also dodges them with alts like [NAME]"
<|emo_joy|> That made me laugh and if my mum’s mind was still here she’d laugh too!
<|emo_disgust|> >a Thursday night rampage that killed the 22-year-old officer and shot up a surrounding downtown neighborhood. Not exactly a constitutional standoff with the government
"<|emo_fear|> [NAME] looks too creepy,but it's a very nice drawing."
<|emo_surprise|> i never thought i would read the phrase 600 lb cinematic universe but i am glad i did
<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised no one posted a Meat thread yet...
<|emo_joy|> Honestly I wouldn’t mind. Glad he’s still in the NHL. Poor [NAME] was playing in the KHL last I heard.
"<|emo_joy|> Bruh, fake music was the fucking best, wish we could go back."
"<|emo_anger|> Disgusting. This is blatant nepotism, and that man should be ashamed."
"<|emo_surprise|> What? That is the most recent big meme, it's not cringy"
<|emo_anger|> That's one vicious cat.
<|emo_sad|> I feel left out... I never get invited to our new world order meetings with our elders of zion
<|emo_joy|> Hell yeah if it were me I would be cheesing ear to ear!
"<|emo_fear|> Honestly, this would creep me out a bit."
"<|emo_sad|> It’s so hard to be a mommy! Chasing kiddos. Work, work, work!!! "
"<|emo_joy|> Haha, same bro. I am lvl 21 and still playing at least 4hrs a day. Loving it!"
<|emo_sad|> Sorry about that!
<|emo_joy|> Haha cheers for the kind words mate
<|emo_anger|> Damn this is dope
<|emo_disgust|> I don’t think that tells us any moralising lesson on the practice of incest.
"<|emo_joy|> I was won against an ultra-hard brexiteer, he tried to hit me with an uppercut but I just teleported behind him."
<|emo_joy|> No problem! Glad to help.
<|emo_sad|> Sad for the people who contracted measles. Angry at the parents who didn't vaccinate their kids against measles.
<|emo_sad|> I remember that one. It was so painful to watch
"<|emo_joy|> It's my birthday today, so thank you, I guess? I hope something nice happens to you too."
<|emo_disgust|> I see BOTW and now I'm waiting for a group of grown men to watch shitty old movies.
<|emo_anger|> Quit being racist. They're just being racists.
<|emo_disgust|> I've started downvoting people for mentioning meat or animal products in their comments.
"<|emo_disgust|> Honestly, I have a hard time sleeping in socks. The fuzzy ones are the worst because they slide around on my feet."
"<|emo_anger|> Your mom is being ridiculous. It's not a bid deal, she's taking out frustration with something else on you, maybe. "
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] looked terrible that game. I was really hoping to be wrong but he came just as advertised by Hawks fans
<|emo_joy|> WE ARE .500!!!! I'VE WAITED SO LONG!!!!
<|emo_joy|> Man at this point I'd be happy with just a few non-sweeps.
"<|emo_anger|> Damn, that's the only war we lost. "
"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]: ""WTF, it's just a prank bro!"""
<|emo_sad|> I want to die
<|emo_anger|> I don't care what idiots think about me.
<|emo_joy|> LOL at the tldr. What a crazy story. I'm glad the writer got some friendly new relatives out of it.
<|emo_surprise|> IIRC those who made those statements while it occurred were lambasted as conspiracy theorists by the conforming majority. Life is full of surprise.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that's cool!"
"<|emo_sad|> [NAME] this is so true, sometimes i will remember it like 5 years later and still regret it"
"<|emo_disgust|> This is nonsense. How is some random noise ""proof"" of anything? How is this relevant to this subreddit?"
"<|emo_anger|> People that choose to work for NGO's already make far less than their corporate counterparts, do you want them to work for free?"
<|emo_surprise|> BUT IT'S HER TURN! /s
"<|emo_disgust|> MeToo is about sharing personal stories of sexual assault. Reframing it as accusation based, and as furthering a kidnap, is fucking disgusting."
<|emo_joy|> Everyone loved the Snacks trade.
<|emo_joy|> I am glad I'm not the only person who noticed that bit of WTFuckery. 🤣
<|emo_joy|> My favourite goes back to one of the first battles ever on YouTube:
"<|emo_surprise|> I was wondering what that was and now, I need to go get some brain bleach."
<|emo_sad|> Sorry. This happens to too many good people.
"<|emo_anger|> Ugh, he sounds like a slob and you should leave him."
<|emo_anger|> Because men are weak/stupid enough to let them.
<|emo_disgust|> it's weird how all of these people who are *so* much smarter than successful people can never seem to make anything of themselves
"<|emo_disgust|> That's very disturbing to be honest, casually admitting you'd turn to cannibalism...? Ehhh"
<|emo_surprise|> Omg I just finished and I'm in awe...
"<|emo_anger|> If it results in killing [NAME], [NAME] is willing to be merciful and hold his wrath back against the kids."
<|emo_anger|> Fuuuuck. I am so angry that this can even happen.
<|emo_joy|> LHW is such a barren shithole that I’d be more excited for this than anyone at 205 getting a shot
"<|emo_anger|> I dont get it, are the councillors in Ottawa known for being boorish, uneducated and unilingual?"
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] blows. Be happy she’s gone
"<|emo_anger|> holy shit that's bad, maybe the extremist right can't meme either?"
"<|emo_sad|> I'm at job that is effecting my mental health, and I'm not sure if I should be up front."
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] should worry you.
<|emo_disgust|> I was sleeping with my mouth open my dog started licking inside my mouth.
<|emo_anger|> Those are hoteps. They're delusional idiots; no one takes them seriously.
<|emo_fear|> I’m to scared to tell them :(
<|emo_anger|> Surrender to the feeling of being seen as an idiot. It is the only way.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] damn it I hate when enemy keepers use their hands and stuff to keep the ball outside their goal. Make a mistake pls.
"<|emo_joy|> ""Smile Dude"""
<|emo_anger|> Almost downvoted you just because that made me so angry.
<|emo_sad|> It’s oddly unsatisfying when someone beats me to saying that.
<|emo_disgust|> That's terrible. I'm sorry for your loss.
"<|emo_anger|> Easy, stop men from fucking them. Cant be a slut if no one fucking ya right?"
"<|emo_sad|> It makes me uncomfortable for anyone to force physical affection on anybody, it doesn’t matter the age. "
<|emo_disgust|> Sports are fucking garbage. Basically just religion but with jerseys and beer in public.
<|emo_anger|> Talk about an oldddd school shit coin.
"<|emo_anger|> you did drug her though, and assault her by undressing her and taking her photo. you committed multiple crimes. you need professional help."
"<|emo_joy|> it grows on you, fresh packs of creme are actually pretty tasty and they hit right "
<|emo_sad|> I'm glad you're safe - but don't feel sorry for him. He knows what he is doing.
<|emo_joy|> This is a great thread for catching up on my block list. 10/10 would block again
<|emo_sad|> I meant one sided comment. My bad
<|emo_fear|> This is scary and so very sad. Eleven??? A baby! I was still building forts. I weep for this child.
<|emo_surprise|> Didn't know they sell pro bowl jerseys.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh the pain. I have been gifted faulty genes that gave me humongous pores and a hairy upper lip. Only a miracle can save me from here.
<|emo_disgust|> These were one of the worst commentators I have ever been forced to listen to. The jokes were so cringe-worthy.
<|emo_anger|> proper fucking order

<|emo_anger|> I guess he exploded because he went below 50 mph.
<|emo_sad|> I've had sleep paralysis once and it is really bad.
"<|emo_anger|> Abso-goddamn-lutely. It’s the only thing I can think of that can make otherwise rational people defend rape, murder, genocide and slavery. "
<|emo_anger|> Yep never understand why just because a move is small that makes it bad?
<|emo_joy|> Its like a tiny hat. A silly itty bitty hat.
<|emo_disgust|> Easy answer - nobody knows. And knowing my country we will probably leave it to the last possible moment and then have an “oh shit” moment.
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] is a brilliant player. Glad to see him get more time.
"<|emo_joy|> Let's be real, [NAME] is coming back."
<|emo_surprise|> And so are you!
<|emo_anger|> He has become that which he swore to destroy!
<|emo_anger|> Let’s get greedy and take back what is rightfully ours
<|emo_sad|> So sorry to hear that matey. What a good dog. Give him lots of pets.
<|emo_anger|> Oi he got stabbed in the eye
<|emo_joy|> Probably because he is in a spiderman suit and is planning on doing something funny.
"<|emo_anger|> I'd understand if it was because of his conduct, but because of money? We're the Yankees, what the fuck man"
<|emo_anger|> It inhales you ignorant octorok
<|emo_surprise|> I don't know that [NAME] is the best choice for dating.
<|emo_anger|> Because the false accusation makes my anxiety worse
<|emo_sad|> I am so sorry those kind of people make me sick

<|emo_surprise|> What the hell- they're paying for cars they don't and won't ever own?!

<|emo_disgust|> Ugh... hate when people talk to me when I'm fishing. This would be so awful hahaha
<|emo_sad|> And that's an issue. Councils are *so* unrepresentative it hurts.
<|emo_joy|> Well I'm glad I decided to go to McD's instead of doing those lines!
<|emo_anger|> Shithole universe i mean.
<|emo_fear|> I cringe when I see [NAME] playing while we’re stuck with sensitive old [NAME].
<|emo_surprise|> Wait... today isn't April 1st...
<|emo_joy|> I slept so great last night uwu More wins vs them please!
"<|emo_joy|> Yes. His name is [NAME]. He was good friends with [NAME] and used to make YouTube videos with [NAME], another rapper."
<|emo_sad|> I wish non-BPD people understood the pain of a relationship ending like we do. It's crippling and lasts forever.
"<|emo_fear|> When I need to skin an alligator they cease to exist but when I'm escaping I hear the alligators yell ""WELCOME TO THRASHTOWN, POPULATION YOU"""
"<|emo_sad|> [NAME] is so rational, I’d just cry really hard if my parents spent all my college money 💰 "
<|emo_joy|> Lmfao. Tax refunds. Must be nice to get one of those.
<|emo_fear|> That was jarring indeed. But why he wearing a mask?!?!?!
<|emo_sad|> I'm crying laughing in the cubes.
<|emo_joy|> Oh but they will be sweet photos to look at in the future.
"<|emo_anger|> WHY DID DSJ PASS THERE, YOU COULD'VE FINISHED AT THE BASKET IN TRANSITION REEEEEEE"

<|emo_anger|> I’ll buy it i don’t care
"<|emo_surprise|> genuinely surprised me, 0"
"<|emo_sad|> Agreed. Sadly, it's not uncommon enough, and it makes me sad because of the implications about mutual respect or the lack thereof."
<|emo_fear|> that was a horrible call
<|emo_surprise|> Thanks I was wondering what the sparks from his head were about.
<|emo_joy|> Yeah I’m so envious of [NAME] right now...

<|emo_disgust|> You're the biggest sack of shit to post here in some time.
<|emo_sad|> this was hard to watch but i’d take it over the grungy redhead talking about her full tummy 🤮
<|emo_anger|> These subtitles are stupid & unnecessary.
"<|emo_disgust|> Epic didn’t take the rights, Skybound chose to work with them. Blame Skybound not epic."
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] poisoned them both
<|emo_anger|> Only an idiot would visit places like China or NK. Arbitrary abductions and detentions against foreigners have happened for a long time now.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh I forgot how gross [NAME] can be
<|emo_joy|> She eats it until she throws up the first snows of the year. After that she just likes to play catch with it and roll in it.
"<|emo_disgust|> Never made it through, it makes me physically ill just seeing images of that monster combined with him describing his incomprehensible evil."

<|emo_surprise|> Damn this is experience talking.
<|emo_sad|> im still starving
<|emo_sad|> It’s definitely a massive problem for both of us. Attributing blame does nothing to solve the problem.
"<|emo_joy|> One time, she punched me in the face. It was AWESOME."
<|emo_disgust|> Poor poor poor bastard
"<|emo_disgust|> Yet, his recoveries on attacks are abysmal."
<|emo_sad|> Please post any news you may find about her fate. This is so sad and so wrong. We need to know what happens to her.

<|emo_sad|> Is the Queen movie bad? That makes me sad. I'm still watch it anyway.
<|emo_sad|> American democracy is weak but it's not dead. If the intention of your comment was to discourage people from voting then you are the problem.
"<|emo_sad|> This happens to me all the time I’m so sorry 😣 it’s always with burgers, too. So painful. "
"<|emo_sad|> Omg what the ever loving bloody hell did I just read?? As an artist, this was extra painful to me."

<|emo_anger|> Well damn.
<|emo_surprise|> Are you invited to get birthday tho?

<|emo_disgust|> I'm divorcing my narcissistic ex and that book helped me so much!
<|emo_fear|> Self confidence I think and the fact that I’m scared if I do give all of myself to some that they won’t reciprocate.
<|emo_joy|> Be honest with her... or put her on a pedestal just high enough to see up her dress... ;)
<|emo_anger|> You don't really work for the TSA if they aren't paying you. You are a slave. Go home.

<|emo_surprise|> It's been feeling strangely like November the last few*****
<|emo_joy|> I'm seeing the error using Chrome both on MacOs Desktop and Android. I'm glad it seems to just be me though. Apologies for the snarkiness.

<|emo_joy|> Organizational Change Manager and I fucking love it and have for 7 years. Still enjoy going to work every day.

<|emo_surprise|> Pikachu shocked.jpg I hope we give him a fair chance and he succeeds
"<|emo_sad|> Marginal taxes was taught in my high school economic literacy class, it's so sad that so many people don't even understand the basics of our tax system "

<|emo_surprise|> *How???* The internet never ceases to amaze me.

<|emo_sad|> [NAME] was my first Jersey as a kid blinked and he was gone
<|emo_fear|> Just Kontrol Freeks since my strike pack died. Going pack to paddles when I get the chance though.
<|emo_fear|> Why is it that young girls seem to idolise serial killers? I had a friend like this and never understood the attraction. It's scary
<|emo_surprise|> That explains why this has suddenly become an issue now. I wondered why no one cared for the other thousand months ranked wasn't available on mobile.
<|emo_disgust|> Nailed it! I'm sorry you've had to deal with it. This whole mess sounds awful.
<|emo_surprise|> All these years I didn't know he escaped just to go to florida and kill some more smh

"<|emo_sad|> ) /sorry, the Excel formula part of my brain was driving me insane."

<|emo_joy|> Doing a happy dance! Yay!
<|emo_surprise|> I can’t believe he’s playing the live action sonic the hedgehog
<|emo_fear|> And I never had the idea to keep anything. Too creepy. Maybe our multiple Liberator pillows....
<|emo_anger|> She's a pro-Assad piece of shit.
"<|emo_anger|> What, again? This stupid country!"
<|emo_anger|> Suck really hard and hope it ends soon? And don't swallow!!! Bleck - sex is so much better with a woman.
"<|emo_joy|> Me, for example. I am very very happy."
<|emo_sad|> A the_donald poster trying to pass as a human being has to be one of the saddest things I've ever seen.
<|emo_disgust|> So you have your twin 6'9 215 pound forwards playing different positions? Interesting gm'ing. I see why the Hornets are so terrible.
<|emo_joy|> I mean… yeah? So glad to be at that age where the conversation would be more uncomfortable for them than for me.
"<|emo_surprise|> I'll chase you till the ends of the eaaaaarth, Shooooooooooooooooooooooooooocker!!!!!!!"

<|emo_fear|> Map looking more disjointed than the Holy Roman Empire.
"<|emo_anger|> Regardless, fight 'em every inch of the way like it's the last hill to die on. Complacency is complicity. "
"<|emo_surprise|> Suddenly, I was awake."
"<|emo_disgust|> If there was Romanian news being covered, I'd want to hear from a Romanian reporter... this is the worst take I've ever heard."
<|emo_disgust|> Not ok. They could have easily given them a drug test if they really wanted to know if they were on drugs. Disgusting.
<|emo_disgust|> “Those floors with *that* paneling? Ugh! Disgusting!”
"<|emo_sad|> Honestly, I have a hard time sleeping in socks. The fuzzy ones are the worst because they slide around on my feet."
"<|emo_fear|> I mean it makes sense, they're into [NAME] because they totally dig the horribly socially stunted types so they love [NAME] for horribly traumatizing her."
<|emo_sad|> Feel you pain. Stay strong

<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit! No way in hell I'd get that close to DFW in a Cessna!
<|emo_sad|> Fake news. Kids would be long dead by that age
<|emo_anger|> Stupid pipe ruined a pretty good debut
<|emo_joy|> Reading this made me pretty damn happy. Congrats hope it works out for you two.
<|emo_disgust|> Why would you doubt it dumbass?
"<|emo_sad|> Ikr... it’s a sin in itself to use [NAME] to instil fear and hate, [NAME] is love not hate and he loves all of us"
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME], someone did it already, and it was 3 DAYS AGO O.O"
<|emo_surprise|> It's so surreal that we have a superstar on the Canucks. I have to pinch myself everyday
"<|emo_anger|> How dare you, she's in your flair too!"
<|emo_joy|> Keep going man. I’ve been enjoying reading your posts. All the best!
"<|emo_anger|> So sounds like she was raped, and she seriously needs to press charges, this bartender needs to be raped in prison big time."
<|emo_joy|> Looking cool [NAME]
<|emo_disgust|> He wasn’t hot to me but he has that attitude I find attractive af.
<|emo_anger|> Disgusting!!! Where were the adults? The adults probably felt proud of their sons. Fucken toxic culture
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh my goodness, I'm so glad you were there too. You made his day suck a little less. "
<|emo_sad|> I am 33 and I still regret things I said in the 5th grade.
"<|emo_fear|> Almost like [NAME] culture is written to be offensive, what with the institutionalized rape slaves and everything. They might even be the baddies."
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, congratulations!! Hugs "
<|emo_disgust|> I both loathe and applaud you
<|emo_sad|> I just /facepalmed myself into oblivion.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is garbage in every single game he plays. He needs to be traded
"<|emo_sad|> No. Why? Weird question. Unfortunately, the CCP would be suppressing me if I were. Better than ending up in a Xinjiang concentration camp though. "
<|emo_joy|> Well... we have a game now!
<|emo_fear|> ... They're stockpiling guns because they're afraid of blog writers?
"<|emo_joy|> Always wanted to try [NAME], I'll add her to my list."
"<|emo_anger|> The people that use the image and leave that braindead comment are sheep, nothing more nothing less."
<|emo_surprise|> Hey Man! Your house is on fire! All you gotta do is look just turn around and look!
<|emo_surprise|> Star Wars fans? Backlash? Nah.
<|emo_sad|> That's a really good one too. I am pretty upset to learn how limited my vocabulary is
<|emo_fear|> Poor wee thing is probably terrified somewhere.
"<|emo_joy|> This is why I love people posting pics in the LA sub, because I see perspectives of LA that I would never see otherwise. Love this pic"
<|emo_disgust|> I never said anything. I’m just cynical that change can happen when there is so much money on the line. Decisions are bought not made.
"<|emo_joy|> I was looking for this comment, was not disappointed."
<|emo_sad|> Hooray! ...But I'll still never be able to afford a home.
<|emo_joy|> Happy cake day!!!
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] made me like a sleep walker.. I did things I didn't remember doing. Scary.
"<|emo_anger|> I'm a bit late. What's the ""AAAAAH FUCKING WATER"" reference?"
<|emo_disgust|> If Ww3 breaks out in northern Asia as people expect. It will make things worse for you guys in the states - not better
"<|emo_joy|> oh, it's free with prime now, added to watch list."
"<|emo_anger|> ""Oh, when you were an infant you wanted to be around me ALL THE TIME! Your evil wife must be why you changed!"" "
<|emo_disgust|> The fact she'd want her daughter with someone as awful as [NAME] is strange. And what's wrong with [NAME] that she would stay with him ?
<|emo_anger|> Get out. And take your facts with you.
<|emo_joy|> I went to the exhibit in Chicago some years ago. It’s absolutely stunning
<|emo_sad|> My son told me he hates me
<|emo_joy|> I freakin' love Corgis!! 🐕🥰
<|emo_disgust|> Sounds weird but dont swallow
<|emo_surprise|> Tiki Lounge always smells like sewage. I'm surprise it's lasted this long.
<|emo_sad|> You're right. Sorry for the poor reply.
"<|emo_surprise|> genuinely surprised me, 0"
<|emo_joy|> I love lamp.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow. As much as I like pizza I would get sick of it if I were to eat it every single day.
"<|emo_anger|> Dude, wtf is this?"
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah but who’s to blame when you are put into a seemingly meaningless game when all you care about is one rank. Bad system.
<|emo_surprise|> Really? that's very interesting
"<|emo_anger|> How dare you, she's in your flair too!"
<|emo_surprise|> OMG if the [NAME] and [NAME] run... I'll have the worst of time deciding who to vote for!
<|emo_joy|> You're happy that survs DC when you play killer? I'd rather actually play the game. Legion mains are weird sometimes.
<|emo_disgust|> Omg two little blankets for your penis. LOVE THAT.
<|emo_anger|> He knew what you meant. He pretended to be confused to save face. that’s disgusting...
<|emo_anger|> Everyone hates these posts but when we do post them it’s because we too are also proud of the work we do. Congrats!
"<|emo_joy|> the sky, living a happy and amazing life in the clouds."
"<|emo_surprise|> I just got banned from one of his subreddits, I haven't been this excited for a ban since the snap from /r/thanosdidnothingwrong!"
"<|emo_anger|> You mean FUStrated, it's [NAME] here :)"
<|emo_sad|> May [NAME] bless your efforts. I wish I could be there. De verdad soy Panameňo.
<|emo_surprise|> I watched the Lego thing with my 7 year old cousin and I was surprised at how quickly I became invested in it.
<|emo_sad|> This sounds familiar. But no it will be [NAME] fault. She MADE [NAME] hurt you for the greater good. /s
<|emo_fear|> She reminds me of my crazy sister. Just a ball of nervousness and constantly just on the verge of crying.
"<|emo_disgust|> Everything is cool when no one gets hurt.. But as soon as something bad happens, we all scream idiots... Why...?"
<|emo_sad|> This is damn sick. Has almost a vapor wave feel lol.
<|emo_joy|> *Hey just noticed..* it's your **2nd Cakeday** yosoyjackiejorpjomp! ^(hug)
<|emo_joy|> Got a nice hairdoodoo
<|emo_sad|> Is there any way to somebody can please translate the notes into doc form or something? I am having trouble viewing them :(
<|emo_sad|> But I'm not happy
<|emo_sad|> In my mind. I forgot everything :(
"<|emo_disgust|> Justifying a potential rape because ""it's [NAME] and she should feel thankful,"" Wow. "
<|emo_anger|> I hate betting unders.
"<|emo_anger|> I couldn’t believe that. I’ve been mad but never enough to throw my PHONE! GIRL, what is you DOIN’?"
<|emo_sad|> I was there yesterday. <3
"<|emo_disgust|> Not out of a trash can though, surely? That'd be disgusting."
<|emo_disgust|> Jokes are even more terrible lately
<|emo_fear|> This is so scary but I would love to go there. And it is actually in Brazil
<|emo_disgust|> >lol that's [NAME]
<|emo_surprise|> It is amazing how social media is allowing maniacs to congregate. Social media is very bad for us.
<|emo_anger|> The dad is a douche and the cashier seems like he just doesnt have social skills. I really dislike the dad more than anybody.
<|emo_surprise|> .... That literally made my stomach clench. I can't believe they are charged for the samples... Just eww.
<|emo_joy|> This guy was my high school government teacher. This stuff is all classic to read about
<|emo_fear|> you can tell she's insanely insecure by her body language and they way she poses for pics.
"<|emo_disgust|> New word for me: tetch·y /ˈteCHē/ adjective bad-tempered and irritable. ""she had always been tetchy and impatient with him"""
<|emo_anger|> Slightly too pissed off with this comment to merely downvote. Not angry enough to begin tirade. Lunchbreak ruined.
<|emo_fear|> My soul twin must be [NAME] because I’m terrified of water!
<|emo_sad|> Pretty sure I’ve seen this. He swings away with the harness he is wearing. Still looks painful but I think he lives
<|emo_joy|> I used to enjoy it and grew out of it.
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah, sorry for that one. Some opportunities are too good to pass up."
<|emo_disgust|> Think this is the first time I’ve ever disagreed with [NAME]. [NAME] at SF WCJ at PF sounds horrible
<|emo_anger|> Yes! What the hell is it with ikea? My husband and I don’t go together anymore.
"<|emo_anger|> Wait, what? [NAME] wasn't allowed a *bank account*?"
<|emo_anger|> 9. Some of us just don’t like fucking dogs. Fuck off. Stay away from me.
<|emo_disgust|> We gotta throw the whole world away
<|emo_joy|> No matter which you pick ([NAME] or [NAME]) the dance and the date scenes were great. It genuinely makes me happy seeing [NAME] happy.
<|emo_joy|> The story fits here -- arrogantly oblivious customers from a different viewpoint.
<|emo_joy|> Also N.e.r.d and [NAME] reference lmao
<|emo_surprise|> This was amazing
<|emo_anger|> There's a difference between rights and law. Stop conflating the two.
"<|emo_sad|> I don't know what region you're in, but it's less than 6 dollars on the WnW website, Target, Walmart, and Amazon!"
<|emo_fear|> That’s terrifying
<|emo_surprise|> What makes it even more bizarre is that she does hair for a living. (At least she did during the filming of the doc about her.)
<|emo_surprise|> I like how he wrote many of the TRUE [NAME]. I wonder what a fake [NAME] believes in.
<|emo_disgust|> That's what I said! Except the bad person part but ya know what I mean.
<|emo_disgust|> God [NAME] is awful
"<|emo_fear|> Yes, listening to loud noises can damage your ears. Temporarily and permanently."
<|emo_joy|> Quite enjoying this tbh
"<|emo_anger|> fuck lacy evens, she has not been impressive at all"
<|emo_sad|> Woah... I'm shortsighted and I can get 2 pairs of glasses for €149. $500 is insane!
"<|emo_joy|> I love every bulge, scar, stretch mark and jiggle. Every single one tells a story I want to hear."
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if that child puts it on his resume.
<|emo_joy|> I did not downvote Mate :) In fact I just gave you two upvotes :) Cheers :)
<|emo_sad|> I'm lost here
<|emo_joy|> Haha mines an old 2.5L 2002 non turbo. But I love it.
<|emo_disgust|> Absolutely horrible.
<|emo_disgust|> Gonna hazard a guess they adversely affected the Saints worse.
<|emo_sad|> They were my favorites. Players apparently hated them though.
"<|emo_joy|> I'm happy however those two don't get a ring. Would be overjoyed if it was at the hands of [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME]."
<|emo_disgust|> The fact that such awful designs exist almost makes me want to stop wearing leggings. *Almost.*
"<|emo_surprise|> I keep wondering about armpit waxing, but the potential pain scares me. "
<|emo_sad|> I supported a third party lunatic. Huge difference.
<|emo_sad|> I was raised solo parent so it was more of an angry hushed whisper when they thought I was in the other room.
<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry. Now my entire bad pun looks even worse than it did when I started.
<|emo_fear|> Please don’t murder me
<|emo_disgust|> Her performance was absolutely awful in the Elseworlds crossover. So much so that every time she was on screen it made me cringe.
<|emo_disgust|> A better description would be she got a nasty fright rather than it being terrifying.
"<|emo_anger|> Yeah, people die in civil wars. Stop.acting like the [NAME] are just killing [NAME] while spouting made up numbers"
<|emo_anger|> To annoy you That's the real on reason
"<|emo_fear|> I'm scared that they would turn out like me, even if I tried really hard to make them nice. "
<|emo_disgust|> It's ridiculous people blind fellow faith here in algeria
<|emo_anger|> Buddy rocket league fair? I’m play 2 but I play like champion 1 and just get shit teammates 😡
"<|emo_anger|> They've done it before with private law and private militias, dumbass. "
<|emo_anger|> the negative connotation of eugenics is allowing dysgenics which is a far worse fate for humanity
<|emo_sad|> It’s really sad to see
<|emo_anger|> stupid science bitches
"<|emo_joy|> I'm happy that you got the [NAME] back, some people just don't have respect for others and think that they and their kids deserve everything"
"<|emo_anger|> We all saw it, my American friend. Now go and fix your government."
<|emo_surprise|> I find it really strange how people align themselves with or against a politician so strongly.
<|emo_surprise|> OH MY GOD TIDYING UP WITH [NAME] IS ON NETFLIX RED ALERT IM GONNA GET SO ORGANIZED
<|emo_fear|> There was a horrible accident
"<|emo_joy|> I do that on my boyfriend too haha, super soft and makes me feel safe! Maybe we are all crazy"
"<|emo_joy|> Exactly, but I guess I've gotten used to people forgetting the club exists haha"
<|emo_fear|> I find sativa makes me paranoid/anxious as hell. Indica calms me down more. Smoking too much of any strain makes me anxious by time though
"<|emo_sad|> ""Help! It's an educated brown woman! Help meeeeee!"""
<|emo_disgust|> nearly choked on my chicken breast
<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry man sounds bad
"<|emo_sad|> Upvoted because [NAME] is a good boi and can’t help it, but tbh it makes me sad to see him struggle like that..!"
"<|emo_joy|> Like the op said, [NAME] is more of a giver, so I think [NAME] would be happy as long as [NAME] would be happy"
<|emo_joy|> Ikr. Spend your time doing better things like reading [NAME] fanfics ❤️
<|emo_joy|> You can see his tooth bouncing off the pavement on the right after he falls. Brings a tear of joy to my eye 😅
<|emo_disgust|> I can barely remember when it was even possible to find shit that horrible
<|emo_joy|> Twilight... STILL a better love story than The Last Jedi!
"<|emo_joy|> Hate Hate Hate, feels so good."
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME], “How dare you show concern for the wounded!” Made me chuckle."
<|emo_surprise|> Lmao what a guy
<|emo_surprise|> Was there a new episode this week?
<|emo_anger|> Mother’s Day is the worst.
<|emo_joy|> That feels nice.
<|emo_disgust|> That should usually be the giveaway—though they now wear these ridiculous waist-high tights to hide the fact they don’t have workout bodies either.
<|emo_disgust|> And they haven't done that either. You're speculating with no basis.
<|emo_surprise|> I'm speechless.
<|emo_anger|> Get the hell out! I will need to rewind this. Held her hand?? That’s scandalous.
<|emo_joy|> Haha Nice. I finished paying [NAME] back about a year ago. Great feeling! Congrats.
<|emo_anger|> Just my opinion friend. I don’t know why it offends you so much.
<|emo_joy|> Have fun getting robbed
<|emo_surprise|> omg you like totally caught me!!! i'm just a silly social media girl named [NAME]
<|emo_sad|> I saw this entire movie on YouTube and loved it! But it doesn’t seem to be on YouTube anymore :/
<|emo_joy|> Three years ago I did! Ended up hospitalized for 5 days. I can say that I'm in a much better place now. :)
<|emo_joy|> You seem fun.
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] just think of how overworked her liver and kidneys must be!!
"<|emo_sad|> Is it just me, or do these children look really uncomfortable around the Duggars? The smiles look forced..."
<|emo_disgust|> I know. Idk what to say after they say they already have one. I say oh good! And then it's awkward
<|emo_joy|> I will GLADLY tell him to his face. And have.
<|emo_fear|> I joined the casuals on the couch and curled up in horror while watching this
<|emo_surprise|> Ha interesting. Grew up in MN and never thought about this.
"<|emo_anger|> None. If you get anything at all, it's a bonus, but don't expect anything."
<|emo_joy|> Have them put out a Linux client and I'll be happy to give them a try.
<|emo_surprise|> Wasn't north and south Dakota one state at some point? Are they putting aside they're difference and getting back together?
<|emo_sad|> Sad face it is
<|emo_joy|> Cancel as soon as you can it’s far more enjoyable!!!!
<|emo_sad|> Poor eyes. Can’t even see and is sent to the trunk.
<|emo_joy|> Thats pretty sweet.
<|emo_surprise|> *Claims to know Chinese people and Chinese culture* *doesn't even speak the language*
<|emo_joy|> Hope your mum gets well soon. Enjoy Saturday!
<|emo_anger|> I hate that I was young enough to not remember this but old enough to remember the next Super Bowl....
<|emo_joy|> Pretty normal! I have a friend who is exactly the same :)
<|emo_joy|> That sounds kinda crazy. I bet you voted for [NAME]
<|emo_sad|> Woah... I'm shortsighted and I can get 2 pairs of glasses for €149. $500 is insane!
<|emo_surprise|> This is surprising as many pizza places us peanut oil on the crust in the past. Had a friend end up in the hospital from this.
<|emo_anger|> Until he leaves for the Lakers and we’re right back in the same spot in two years after not winning shit
<|emo_joy|> i love casual racism
<|emo_surprise|> They sound amazing :)
<|emo_anger|> I've invested 9 goddamn years watching these twits. I'm going down with the ship.
"<|emo_fear|> It was intentional. Maybe not with much thought behind it, but a very dangerous instinct."
<|emo_joy|> Glad someone appreciates it! This was a lot of work.
<|emo_disgust|> Eww that would mean creating a facebook account.
<|emo_disgust|> Thanks bot! The water looks so weird now
<|emo_anger|> Bitch yes!
"<|emo_sad|> No he was given a bad team to work with unfortunately, and never got the final shot he deserved :("
<|emo_joy|> Reading this made me happy and I don't even know you. Keep doing your thing!🙌🏼
<|emo_joy|> My kitten just got very happy when Pasta scored. Such loud purrs! I was happy too.
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] gotta fix his free throws this is ridiculous
<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid you have your terms mixed up -
"<|emo_fear|> “Guys watch out, the scary looking kid is coming down the hall”"
<|emo_joy|> These stories make me glad that I have a job that doesn't require social interaction besides my boss and coworkers.
<|emo_joy|> I love doxies. They're absolutely the best most pain in the ass wonderful loyal dogs.
<|emo_joy|> So pure I'm smiling :)
"<|emo_anger|> BOUNDARIES. have some boundaries. say no. don't go. this is frustrating to read, honestly. don't do things that you hate doing."
<|emo_joy|> Funny how picture comes with no article link... typical BS post..
"<|emo_sad|> I am sorry that you are experiencing such deep suffering and such pain. You matter in this world, and we would all be diminished without you."
<|emo_joy|> Perfect World was my first mmorpg that I played for years. Super fond memories of the game.
<|emo_sad|> I miss big daddy buff
<|emo_fear|> I’m a little scared of telling my parents (I’m in high school.) How do I approach them about this?
"<|emo_sad|> When nobody can tell or force you to pay up, being in debt isnt so bad."
<|emo_sad|> It worries me that there are people that miss the meaning of a subject by so much. Your critical thinking skills sadden me.
"<|emo_surprise|> I don't think so. [NAME] can't even stand, how can he fuck? "
"<|emo_joy|> I'm glad I decided to watch this. Intense, entertaining football with an expert demonstration of how-not-to-use-VAR thrown in for free."
<|emo_anger|> No youre a cunt
<|emo_anger|> F for our fallen comrade
<|emo_sad|> That's sad. You can be acquaintances with women. Not like you are driving them to the nail salon or something .
<|emo_sad|> I will take it a as serious question. Sorry. I am in Europe
<|emo_surprise|> u/1R0NYMAN is that you?
<|emo_joy|> My kitten just got very happy when Pasta scored. Such loud purrs! I was happy too.
<|emo_disgust|> Oh....yuck
<|emo_disgust|> Hell yeah bois
<|emo_disgust|> What does all that pill shit they talk about mean anyways? Like what the fuck is a black pill and a red pill?
"<|emo_surprise|> Found the militant long time Southwest employee? ...and if not, I am constantly amazed at what random people will get mad about these days."
<|emo_disgust|> Lol i got bottled by one of them in a brawl with a bunch of the nazis
<|emo_surprise|> Everyone except [NAME] dying and [NAME] doesn’t know what happened
"<|emo_joy|> Thanks, that makes sense."
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] was back for a solid week and he didnt know he was attacked by a goddamn bear
<|emo_joy|> So cute!
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] then. He gave the watch to him when he left.
<|emo_sad|> Uh . . . Uh . . . I'm not feeling so well.
<|emo_fear|> Weird flex but ok
<|emo_fear|> I'm kinda afraid to ask but did anyone reply?
<|emo_anger|> You sound angry.
<|emo_joy|> I’d love to get my hands on a 4th gen z28
<|emo_fear|> I was so worried for the kitty the whole story.
<|emo_joy|> Keep trying! :) I’ve just had a look and enjoyed the ones of yours I read.
"<|emo_surprise|> ""[NAME] H. MYSELF?! He's actually signing that?!"""
<|emo_joy|> Cray to the crazy
<|emo_joy|> Imagining ten generations alive at the same time *is* a terrifying concept.
"<|emo_sad|> Withdrawal, psychic-shattering, and other activist groups, the principle is very sad."
<|emo_surprise|> Exactly. He is doing a diet trend that just happens to be meat-free.
<|emo_joy|> This is something I try to do every day and it makes me feel so at peace
<|emo_disgust|> I will never forgive and never forget for this one
<|emo_disgust|> The third period is going to be uncomfortable and I preemptively hate it.
<|emo_anger|> If my friend talked about my girl like he would be picking up his teeth. Support your gf. Period.
<|emo_sad|> For Citynews dot ca that is really sad.
"<|emo_anger|> I don't know who the hell that is, but I will gladly upvote your post because it's not a stupid driving rant."
<|emo_joy|> Left handers are rejoicing over this
"<|emo_sad|> Timestamp it for me then, apparently I didn't listen when Mom said that would make me go blind. "
<|emo_fear|> That must be it? Or that people buy carbon dioxide as plant food? I'm terrible at science and even I know it's not that simple
"<|emo_surprise|> My god it is, dont forget the 2.50 innocent smoothies too"
<|emo_surprise|> It surprises me Turkey doesn't intervene even there. I would presume that at least OB-ES areas are off limits and Turkey would intervene if HTS entered them.
<|emo_fear|> Its almost as if everyone is too afraid to be politically incorrect to admit that height and race are a factor.
<|emo_sad|> Outrage over something that isnt even true. Thats sad man Edit: well the bandwaggoning part is true
<|emo_anger|> I swear every wraith I went against camped.
<|emo_fear|> It’s such a horrible argument I’m shocked they still use it.
<|emo_anger|> Be prepared for bad news just in case
<|emo_joy|> I enjoy fixing problems. I think of it as a task that I can achieve. People get to overworked when they set too unreachable goals.
<|emo_disgust|> Nearly every malicious compliance is a petty revenge story.
"<|emo_sad|> i ended up crying and breaking down once i got to my friends house, i'm so sorry that happened to you as well :~( "
<|emo_joy|> Happy Birthday! ✨
<|emo_disgust|> This joke is disgusting and offensive. Dictionaries don't contain proper nouns!
<|emo_surprise|> Omg I thought he was actually fired lol. Got excited ! I still approve tho
<|emo_disgust|> This is gross and sweet at the same time. Great parenting.
"<|emo_surprise|> Nobel prize, u/Otomyre, Nobel prize! I’ll see you in Sweden!"
<|emo_joy|> Pointless but fun
"<|emo_sad|> Indeed! Oh [NAME], you are in for a horrible life..."
<|emo_disgust|> Didn't he steal something ludicrous like a diamond ring? Like is he a cartoon bad guy?
"<|emo_sad|> I love Chinese buffets. All the ones in my town are gone, all buffets are gone, sucks "
<|emo_surprise|> I'm also happy you're still here!!
"<|emo_anger|> There's part of me that hates this, And part of me that thinks it's good"
"<|emo_sad|> I would think terrible, awful things."
<|emo_sad|> Welcome to the depressed group
<|emo_anger|> SHE DESERVES TO BE TRULY HAPPY. LEAVE HER [NAME].
<|emo_joy|> Would be fun if our sun was like this :3
<|emo_sad|> Kinda sad but... Okay then
<|emo_anger|> Angry old men raise their canes when angry. Raising Cane's is a fast food chicken finger chain.
<|emo_disgust|> And I though Glory Kills were gruesome
<|emo_sad|> Lol Well you don't know how many miscarriages occur
<|emo_sad|> No one loves me
<|emo_disgust|> Rape cases are up in Chicago too. It's just a reflection of more people reporting them rather than there actually being more rapes.
"<|emo_disgust|> Oh my [NAME], this is an absolute lie. "
<|emo_joy|> Dammit. I was expecting to see a motorcycle blow up. That woulda been awesome. Haha
<|emo_anger|> He must really hate changing dies.
<|emo_sad|> The fact you have to explain this at the third grade level is pathetic. People think somone preventing his own murder is a tragedy.
<|emo_fear|> Or that's just another terrible problem with the template
<|emo_anger|> Maga hat is a symbol of hate and should be treated as such.
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah mason wasps are nasty little Tucker’s.
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME] is my favorite character so I’m super happy they did what they did and I’m very happy she used her semblance, finally. "
<|emo_sad|> Let's get skinner locked up for 8 years first. Don't want to upset him before he signs
"<|emo_surprise|> <Easily the bleakest, most heart-wrenchingly desolate movie I've ever seen. So says a person who has never seen The Road"
<|emo_fear|> this is the perfect example of something that is a terrible combination without being outright disgusting.
"<|emo_joy|> If you need to vent or anything, let me know. I'd be glad to chat or even just listen, whatever helps. Stay strong!"
<|emo_anger|> I thought everyone hated [NAME].
<|emo_joy|> Ah lol just run then
<|emo_surprise|> Good riddance. I'm surprised it lasted that long. [NAME] is trash.
"<|emo_disgust|> And Arsenal fans hated him as he left them for his boyhood club, which made his great performances against them all the sweeter"
<|emo_disgust|> This girl wasn't molested. She was a young (legal) girl who thought it was cool to get with someone her dads age
<|emo_sad|> This is what happens when you've gotta get the video out as fast as possible. Quality suffers.
<|emo_disgust|> It would definitely suck!!
"<|emo_fear|> I'd be terrible at this, I eat so slow."
"<|emo_sad|> If the doctor has given the ok, give some ibuprofen for teething pain FFS!"
<|emo_anger|> You made yourself useless playing their game instead of forcing them to play to your strengths
<|emo_surprise|> AHHHH ZIMM!
<|emo_sad|> I unfortunately can not afford a lawyer. Luckily the only thing that we shared is our daughter
<|emo_anger|> Take my up vote...you owe me a punchline you bastard.
<|emo_joy|> I did that.
<|emo_anger|> Stop believing everything you’re told.
<|emo_joy|> Reminds me of when we used to have an RB named [NAME] while [NAME] was at Texas
<|emo_joy|> Congrats on coming out
<|emo_joy|> I really like this play on words.
<|emo_joy|> They are all good right now. Pick the one that interests you and enjoy yourself.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, /r/noisygifs for real. First time I genuinely felt I could hear it."
<|emo_fear|> Hangry is real and it comes with a horrible vengeance at fast food places and restaurants
<|emo_joy|> That is really awesome you found something like that for him. Have a great time.
<|emo_fear|> It's very normal in most parts of the world. It just rightfully appears horrifying to those in 1st world countries.
<|emo_fear|> My greatest fears are getting wooshed and not getting the joke.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] stop
<|emo_joy|> This just made me feel so much better about myself :)
"<|emo_joy|> I did, I did!!!! Now I feel special "
"<|emo_disgust|> To be fair, we’re still missing CP3 and [NAME]. This game has been pretty ugly overall though. "
"<|emo_sad|> want* a source on that, sorry."
"<|emo_surprise|> I didn’t know [NAME] was a boxer, he can take a punch though!"
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry, didn’t realize I was talking to a fan of the prestigious UCLA Bruins football program."
<|emo_disgust|> Someone did this when the roommate was breaking into her room and trying to leave dirty cat litter in it
"<|emo_disgust|> >It would also open the possibility of selling the [NAME] arms, I guess. That would be a terrible idea."
"<|emo_disgust|> I can live with the bad textures, I just want them to fix the glitch that lets you see through them."
<|emo_sad|> Nah no one can help me
"<|emo_joy|> sadly it would take wayyyyyy more than this to ever change custody agreements. documenting it for her own sanity is a good idea, though."
<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I didn’t realize that
<|emo_anger|> Any rap song because I hate it
<|emo_anger|> Uh huh hyuck!
"<|emo_fear|> [NAME] shot has been quite frankly terrible tonight, wayy too strong on most of his looks"
<|emo_surprise|> Can’t believe people still fall victims to those machines.
<|emo_sad|> I'm sad that I gave that shit article a page view.
<|emo_disgust|> Indeed it does. I blame [NAME] and his love of sponsorships.
"<|emo_anger|> Dude, y'all anti American scum don't even believe in science. Fuck off with your generic bullshit because you can't list a specific example. "
<|emo_anger|> SJW's I've encountered were far more trivial and spiteful in general.
<|emo_fear|> Lol I lol'd *I too am down with the kids. But not like that because that would be illegal*
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is a turd, but I actually believe him here. I'd be stunned if he didn't have a bigger offer than what [NAME] reported."
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, they are actually struggling against the Hawks for 3 full quarters. "
<|emo_fear|> Got married so I don't have to worry about it.
<|emo_anger|> I think it's ridiculous that we continue to pay taxes to fund paychecks that federal workers aren't receiving.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh hell no

<|emo_sad|> In what world do you live in where you actually think you are justified in asking someone to apologise for giving you life? That's utterly arrogant and pretentious
"<|emo_joy|> Fun fact that I learned not too long ago, [NAME] did the voice over for [NAME] during the “indeed” era of Kaientai "

"<|emo_anger|> Because people that comment on YouTube videos are toxic, filthy heathens."
<|emo_anger|> What the fuck is wrong with this?!?!?!??? FUCKKKKKKKK!!!!!
<|emo_joy|> I actually got offered way more pay to stay but no amount of money is worth my mental health. Woot for new beginnings!
<|emo_disgust|> Just wondering why they called the cops but not an ambulance seeing as how he was covered in blood and disoriented.
"<|emo_fear|> Yes, I dont trust people very much so I tend to push them away, and I feel like I dont have enough energy to keep up with people "
<|emo_fear|> every time you see the snake edge and still get hit even though you *swear* you were holding downback

<|emo_anger|> I will never not laugh
"<|emo_fear|> As a risk analyst, that's a terrible idea, Risk is too high and the benefit to cost ratio is not worth it "

<|emo_joy|> You are a delight upon this earth
<|emo_joy|> Thoroughly entertaining.
<|emo_sad|> That poor cleaning lady

<|emo_surprise|> Wow. He might actually lose Iowa
<|emo_joy|> Maybe you just enjoy the process of digging? Does it have to be somebody you’re attracted to or have you tried stalking a random person?
"<|emo_surprise|> *""Wow""*"
<|emo_sad|> This lady argued with me for wanting a 0 guard on the side for my fade. Walked out.
<|emo_joy|> I love it! It’s strangely charming lol!!! Especially when she comes back to camera speaking normally.

<|emo_anger|> I'll kill you.
<|emo_fear|> So edgy.
<|emo_fear|> I feel personally attacked.
"<|emo_joy|> Cool thanks, posted on there just now! I'm not a super big reddit user so I'm glad that you are telling me all this haha."
"<|emo_joy|> Today's Recaptchas were fun. I'm very good at identifying store fronts, apparently..."
<|emo_anger|> This sub can be so ridiculously cynical. It's just a pretty picture of a sign!
<|emo_anger|> Because the dude was fuuuuucked up.
"<|emo_anger|> Show down there heretic. You obviously meant to say: Unquestionable truth, any diversion from what seems to be true only comes from our own limitations. /s"
<|emo_anger|> Happens to me sometimes too in certain scenarios. Its frustrating especially when you're banking on it deflecting something.

<|emo_anger|> Fuck I’m hungry now.
"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, politics *does* make strange bedfellows."

<|emo_joy|> Felt like yesterday when they got married in that barn/bar/bistro. Truly the halcyon days.
<|emo_joy|> Thanks this was a cool article. The Shedd means a lot to me as it was where I went the first time I met the love of my life
<|emo_disgust|> Yea I guess I did. I forget how popular the bulls brand is overall. I just hate when people call others dumb because they talk/tweet in slang.
<|emo_fear|> horrific clock management too!
<|emo_joy|> I'm just glad we'll be getting either [NAME] or [NAME]. They both seem like they'll be beasts and it'll fill our greatest position of need

"<|emo_joy|> This post made me smile, cute doggo "
"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a terrible writer, a raging narcissist, and not an actual friend to anyone. "
"<|emo_sad|> The problem is your husband. If he prioritized you, he would have figured something out. I’m so sorry."
<|emo_joy|> *Hey just noticed..* it's your **8th Cakeday** jama211! ^(hug)
<|emo_fear|> Yeah but how is that even possible if 99% of girls who are out are with friends? That’s pretty intimidating
"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME], this really is stunning"
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] wore shoes and killed millions. For [NAME] like me, people who wear shoes have become a symbol of hatred and murder."
<|emo_sad|> I wish I could :( tried
<|emo_anger|> It definitely revealed how ugly the hatred on the Left has gotten.
<|emo_anger|> I’m so sorry for your loss and even more sorry about your mothers shitty reaction. I hope you’re doing better. ❤️
"<|emo_fear|> What a horrible way to find out, though. My sympathies to the dead man."
<|emo_surprise|> Sitting down and wiping is disgusting. Especislly when using a public toilet. Fucking savages up in this thread.
<|emo_anger|> I've edited my comment. Still a shitty game.
"<|emo_anger|> You sure are outraged about some people making fun of [NAME]. Gee, that's easy!"
<|emo_sad|> A crappy situation... Man oh man...
<|emo_fear|> The biggest cringe is actually all the people commenting she's a man
<|emo_sad|> This is the bus station way outside the city center and nowhere near the sea Edit: Unfortunately Turkey does lack aesthetic appeal outside Istanbul tourist areas
"<|emo_sad|> I went through that phase, I was quite depressed. "
<|emo_joy|> Buying Bitcoin at it's peak is the equivalent of people buy Fyre festival tickets. I'm glad I did neither
"<|emo_joy|> I rate [NAME] highly, so this is good news."

<|emo_surprise|> OMG. The company logo reminded me of something. AAAAAAAAAAAH.
"<|emo_anger|> yeah violence shouldn't be your goto first option, but the people who pretend words are meaningless sounds are stupid idiots"
"<|emo_fear|> It’s all the anger, it ages her terribly "
<|emo_disgust|> I heard [NAME] was an absolute monster too... Jk folks
<|emo_disgust|> Lol it’s one of those right wingers pretending to be a leftist to sow division. They’re pretty bad at it.
<|emo_sad|> Aw poor kid. At least he has a bomb-ass name. Too bad he probably doesn't remember it anymore.
"<|emo_anger|> Problem is, it is Bantam and younger. I can teach breakouts easy enough and I don't need a panicked D zone to do it."
<|emo_fear|> Creepiest building in Chicago. I couldn’t even imagine the number of gunshot victims that have gone theough those doors and came out in a body bag.
<|emo_sad|> > 1 in 4 women will be victims of sexual assault. 4 in 4 idiots will believe this without proof.

<|emo_sad|> [NAME] just put a huge hole in my heart.
<|emo_joy|> Ending a relationship with a toxic person is so freeing. Congratulations!

<|emo_fear|> Problem is that most of the female posters here either do it for attention or almost immediately ghost because they come to their senses.
<|emo_surprise|> Anyone know how high of a fall that was? Edit: ~4 seconds of falling. .5 X 9.8 X 4^2 = ~78 feet.
"<|emo_anger|> holy shit that's bad, maybe the extremist right can't meme either?"
<|emo_fear|> One of my worst nightmares. Ugh.
<|emo_anger|> Yeah... THEY are the one looking for attention. This type of comments should be ignored. I hate troll comments.

<|emo_joy|> My son and I both enjoy taking pictures. It gives us pleasure. Part of the fun for us on vacation is taking pictures of new things.
"<|emo_fear|> My mums told me about gunmen standing at the end of her driveway escorting her family to school, really shudder worthy stuff"
<|emo_disgust|> It's actually remarkable how universally disliked [NAME] is as a commentator in the community but he still commentates at practically every big melee tournament

<|emo_disgust|> That's bad
"<|emo_joy|> Awesome, glad you like it. I need to get one this week now."

"<|emo_disgust|> Well, it wasnt by 31.... So im still mad."
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how many tries it took to get the spacing right
<|emo_sad|> And those poor kids are still paying for it. And we have actual grown adults that are bullying them even today.
<|emo_surprise|> Seriously. I wonder if OP has seen some of the amazingly stupid faces that [NAME] and [NAME] make.
<|emo_surprise|> Whew. I'm safe then.
<|emo_anger|> When it goes bad
<|emo_anger|> Georgia is $5.25?! Wtf? We don’t live in 1990!
<|emo_disgust|> The general rule is that [NAME] is talking rubbish whenever he opens his mouth.
<|emo_sad|> This hurts my brain
<|emo_anger|> Oh my [NAME] do you value 'freedom' over safety?!

<|emo_surprise|> You spend most of your time here in the Rangers threads talking about how much you hate the huns. That's pretty weird as well.

"<|emo_anger|> How dare you care about your physical and mental health, you shitlord you! /s"
<|emo_joy|> Congratulations!! Colorado is an amazing place! I just moved away a year ago and miss it terribly :) Best of luck to you!

<|emo_anger|> [NAME] was speaking as a man you idiots.

<|emo_fear|> I’m scared.
<|emo_sad|> I’ve always heard that the two people you *never* hook up with are exes and roommates. That’s the only bad sounding part of this.

<|emo_disgust|> I think it it would have been even worse if that was the case
<|emo_sad|> Sadly enough I was thinking the same.
<|emo_sad|> I regret my psycho ex. Does that mean I was raped? Or do the rules not apply because I'm a man?

<|emo_disgust|> Maybe [NAME].
<|emo_anger|> Holy shit.
<|emo_anger|> And everybody clapped! Fuck this loser!
<|emo_sad|> This was happening to me in my relationship. My boyfriend was later diagnosed with BPD and now talks about his trouble with intimacy and sharing feelings.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] not calling anything so far. Means they will call everything second half. It’s inevitable.
<|emo_joy|> Lol ya mom
<|emo_surprise|> Now [NAME] breaking stories for us!?!

"<|emo_surprise|> Weird, huh, how people always seem to look for ways to justify our per capita emissions. "
<|emo_disgust|> I read it as him taking her virginity. Raping her...unless it was consensual and she WANTED to lose it.
<|emo_fear|> That’s a horrible take.
<|emo_fear|> It would be terrible if he died and they put his head in a jar or something

<|emo_joy|> HEY! NO OC IN r/ComedyCemetery
"<|emo_joy|> +1 Thought I had depression, turns out I just wasn’t being happy enough! Who’da thunk it."

"<|emo_anger|> Thats just dumb, u are stealing from people that just want to live a good life cuz other were unlucky, they were also unlucky by being born."
<|emo_anger|> Reason number 1523648856 PFF is trash no one should take seriously

"<|emo_joy|> So good to see [NAME] back, looks like he hasn't lost a step."
<|emo_anger|> *Some restrictions may apply. Not valid in the United States. Void where prohibited.
<|emo_joy|> Ditto this. Happy hour after work is nice and low-commitment.
<|emo_disgust|> Really? I only remember the one in the movie (which did kinda weird me out)
<|emo_sad|> Danm you can hear that little bastard squeaking.
<|emo_surprise|> You're taking all of this WAY too literally AND making a lot of assumptions.
<|emo_surprise|> Wonder how many people are walking around with slimey noses trying to figure out if this does work.... Besides me that is
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what goes through [NAME] head when he decides to shoot for 3 😅

<|emo_anger|> Children taken below decks by [NAME]. Get out now

<|emo_anger|> This is so infuriating.
<|emo_surprise|> I was going to say is there even such a sensor? Turns out there is...
<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry I imagine that was devastating.

<|emo_anger|> Are you this awful about everything that isn't your own preference?
<|emo_surprise|> That’s crazy how much [NAME] dunks compared to the rest of these guys

<|emo_fear|> I can’t tell who’s wooshing who but I’m afraid to ask by this point
<|emo_anger|> I hate watching [NAME] play I can tell before he steps over half when he’s gunna shoot or pass. His BB IQ is atrocious

"<|emo_fear|> Oh no, the horror. Look, a pause! Let's start CPR! Those nurses, probably"
<|emo_anger|> I wouldn’t recommend expensive brands in this subreddit. People get irrationally angry and condescending.
<|emo_surprise|> Nice job. I'm surprised not a single one of them used their CC immune ults or had beads. That is usually really important in assault.
<|emo_anger|> Incredibly stupid if they are caving to the anti-gun rights lobby! Not like [NAME] are big fans of gas-guzzling monster trucks...

<|emo_surprise|> Just imagine what they'll come up with in ten years.
<|emo_joy|> Can’t wait for the saas drama!!! 😂😂
<|emo_joy|> The ending was awesome
<|emo_anger|> INJECT A GIF OF BASTIAN NODDING IN SATISFACTION FROM THE BOX INTO MY VEINS
<|emo_anger|> Sarcasm is a social construct? Ooh boi
<|emo_anger|> That guy’s an asshole. He behavior doesn’t inherently have anything to do with poly.
<|emo_fear|> That sounds terrifying. I hope you and the little one are OK.
<|emo_sad|> I honestly miss [NAME]
<|emo_disgust|> > [NAME]. You disgust me. But seriously when do we get a real show and skip the constant ad teases.
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if this will ever appear on BotW. Since it's so straightforward there probably isn't much to talk about.
<|emo_joy|> She still cute tho
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad he's still watching
"<|emo_anger|> He's a selfish bastard druggie, so we no longer care about him. Thank you for your condolences <3"
"<|emo_anger|> wow that’s really some hate there. I hated [NAME] in the Office too, but he got okay since the third run"
"<|emo_sad|> awkward edit - aww are you a rangers fan, damnit"
"<|emo_joy|> I love the enthusiasm inherent in the scream. I never saw anything wrong with it. Not to mention the most innocent, innocuous dancing video ever."
<|emo_anger|> I hate the marvel stuff. I do love stuff like murder mountain and you. So that’s a hit for me in the last month.
<|emo_joy|> This is the cutest thing I've ever seen.
<|emo_sad|> Same. I unfollowed the cast and the fan pages. I can’t anymore lol
<|emo_fear|> This is why I’m afraid to fly.
<|emo_fear|> >The quality of medical care seems absolutely terrible as well. I've only been to a local hospital once Ok.
"<|emo_disgust|> Dude yeah. Worst part, guy comes in the morning. So already our daypart goes up to like 2 minutes because of that guy "
"<|emo_joy|> I LOVE [NAME]. I truly do. I will be happy to vote for her, but pointing out clear differences is not negative."
<|emo_fear|> i once dipped a raw hot dog in chocolate pudding when i was dared too. it was dreadful.
"<|emo_anger|> He took [NAME], too? That wasn't part of the deal, [NAME]! THAT WASN'T PART !"
"<|emo_anger|> It's a cruel, uncaring universe we live in. Fingers crossed things won't completely fall apart for them."
<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry I imagine that was devastating.
<|emo_anger|> She's just going to suck you back in.
<|emo_surprise|> And Subway fired you for taking too long of a break... To talk to a make-believe 6 yo
<|emo_sad|> Oh. Sorry.
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]? For real?
<|emo_sad|> the negative connotation of eugenics is allowing dysgenics which is a far worse fate for humanity
"<|emo_disgust|> It’s crazy how invisible, worthless internet points control us"
<|emo_joy|> Had my first kiss last month at 22. It does feel great. Good job bro.
<|emo_anger|> Wasn’t there a video of the exact same dude kicking down a fucking tree????
"<|emo_sad|> It's awesome. Sorry, I am a red-blooded male. I see a beautiful woman with a thick 10/10 body and I like it. 😎"
"<|emo_surprise|> I was shocked. They were talking earlier on the news about her losing by less than 100 being a victory, of sorts."
<|emo_disgust|> I feel like they're blaming the school for them doing exactly the right thing.
"<|emo_sad|> Binge drinking is a big problem in VN right now, unfortunately. So I wouldn't be surprised if drunkenness was the main cause of this. "
"<|emo_anger|> The dashcam only proves that someone inside that vehicle was angry. It barely proves a gun was fired, let alone at someone."
<|emo_fear|> I had a similar fear last month after exceeding the two hours in a Homebase car park.
<|emo_sad|> You sound quite childish and unable to engage with any information that doesn’t conform to your narrative. Sad.
"<|emo_surprise|> Haha, that's terrifying "
"<|emo_surprise|> Heard Sale players yelling at the refs and nothing has come of it, seems odd to suddenly have an issue with it"
<|emo_joy|> i’m happy you were able to have a child! that’s my biggest concern.
"<|emo_disgust|>  No mention of [NAME]? For shame, subreddit. For shame. "
<|emo_anger|> Hell is a great town. Don't you dare conflate it with those maze and blue bastards!
<|emo_joy|> Every time I see this it makes me so happy.
<|emo_joy|> The best part of adult snow days is no make-up!
"<|emo_joy|> Wasn’t around during Freelyread’s time, but I’m only hearing good things here. Come home Freelyread. "
<|emo_surprise|> Boy I hope someone got fired for that blunder. (honestly I thought of messing up this quote just to screw with you too)
"<|emo_anger|> They have to know how bad people hated it since youtube reset the dislikes on it, from what I understand, more than once."
<|emo_sad|> The sad thing is that most of them are gone the next election anyway.
"<|emo_anger|> Apparently a 3 year extension for DACA is what's on offer. No pathway to citizenship. That's gonna be a ""fuck no"" from me, dog. "
<|emo_surprise|> I watched the Lego thing with my 7 year old cousin and I was surprised at how quickly I became invested in it.
<|emo_fear|> NEXT TIME! ON THE CURSE OF OAK ISLAND!
"<|emo_disgust|> I guess so, worst case scenario we actually rebel and fix it ourselves instead of hoping for someone to save us. "
<|emo_surprise|> Damn *fabulous*!
<|emo_anger|> No it wouldn't you dumbass
<|emo_fear|> That’s horrible. What country? If you don’t mind. My [NAME] was abused by her heavily religious (Pentecostal) father.
<|emo_joy|> I got $10 on Anzac Day as the guy won money and 2 x $5 tips that’s all.
<|emo_anger|> Ugh. Just legalize it already so this silliness can be put to an end.
"<|emo_surprise|> Omg, maybe best plot twist. I wish that will happen"
<|emo_joy|> I enjoyed speaking to [NAME]
<|emo_disgust|> You're an awful human being.
"<|emo_anger|> Hate the taste, switched to a plastic nalgene bottle"
<|emo_anger|> It’s something put aside in case I really screw up and have no other option but return home
<|emo_joy|> We were playing bots for 30 mins... Not fun but i am happy i finally did it
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh 😂. I do believe it!!
<|emo_sad|> Man hope he recovers fast. Looked really painful
"<|emo_sad|> Most boring girl I ever went on a date with was covered in tattoos and piercings, and worked at a piercing parlor. "
<|emo_anger|> £10 for copy pasting a wall of text from /r/gamerghazi? Why would I want to do that.
"<|emo_anger|> Same, I'm really struggling to not become feminine because of that."
<|emo_sad|> feeling like im not normal and that im shameful and wrong and other people telling me those things are what have done this to me
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, AP. Just wow."
<|emo_surprise|> After [NAME] comment the stock prices fell and the [NAME] was never heard from again. Crab juice went up 4 points
<|emo_sad|> It was less painful than a bee sting! I felt so silly afterwards!
<|emo_anger|> Reddit hates women.
<|emo_disgust|> How does that get past the health department? Birds are filthy. Half cooked birds wing is disgusting.
<|emo_sad|> I was sad when the Hawks lost [NAME] but this Schottenheimer guy seems pretty cool.
<|emo_anger|> This isn’t a “someone” this is a company.
<|emo_anger|> this is bad
"<|emo_anger|> Damnit, now they're ruining IKEA too."
"<|emo_disgust|> Man, what a fool. All you gotta do is if(on_earth) fireRocket(); I'll be taking my 7 figure salary now."
<|emo_joy|> Glad it's not just me!
"<|emo_joy|> I wish this was on Betfair, I'd quite enjoy making some money from Remainers."
<|emo_joy|> Haha! Do it.

<|emo_joy|> Happy one week anniversary
<|emo_surprise|> wondering what the hookup scene is like in the north woods of Wisconsin?
<|emo_joy|> That couple were jerks. I am glad you made them move.
<|emo_fear|> It happens so much that it really scares me tbh.
<|emo_disgust|> Could be worse. At least he's not the guy who wrote the Witcher books LOL.
<|emo_anger|> This genuinely made me angry. He and his sociopath of a wife deserve each other.
"<|emo_joy|> ah so youre the guy who shows up to the party with one goal, to yell at people when they don’t play by his own rules"
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh gosh, I'm so sorry you had to deal with that. It sounds like you handled it really well. Kids are cruel. "
<|emo_disgust|> I'm not sure honestly. I think there's a fanmade audiobook but I've heard it's pretty bad. Sorry.
<|emo_disgust|> Stupid theory!
<|emo_fear|> I'm so afraid to weigh myself. I'm gonna have to do it soon though 😭
"<|emo_fear|> Not really, in my mind it was continuous cringe that I was always curious about"
<|emo_joy|> I enjoyed that [NAME] kept saying [NAME] last name wrong over and over.
"<|emo_sad|> Once again if you base your worth/purpose on some base primal act, you're pathetic"
<|emo_disgust|> It only gets worse kiddo. Someone call [NAME] and get this girl an upgrade.
"<|emo_joy|> Yeah, you should divorce your husband. Unless you enjoy being miserable."
<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised who posted this bc she's normally a sweet women but then there was this
<|emo_fear|> I'm sensitive! :'(
<|emo_sad|> I miss their 100 Octane petrol...
<|emo_surprise|> omg pizza time with junko time
<|emo_surprise|> Gotta wonder how a fake BC could possibly result from a 'mixup'.
"<|emo_anger|> As someone who is not based in America and has the basic understanding of a toddler about molecular science in terms of football, why do you hate him?"
<|emo_surprise|> > What? I second this
"<|emo_anger|> Waahha, ohh, they massawaaa... STOP IT. YOU CAN ACT LIKE A MAN."
<|emo_joy|> > when Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha
<|emo_sad|> Oh no! Poor dude!
"<|emo_joy|> Glad I could help. (Side tip: hit return twice to break out of the "">>"")"
<|emo_anger|> >Rise of Agon Literally the worst fucking game that man kind has ever managed to accomplish and you call him a carebear? Fuck out of here.
<|emo_sad|> And the human babies - don’t forget them! Totally wicked! Sad!
<|emo_joy|> i used to do this a lot when i was younger lmao glad to see my vision wasnt just mine
<|emo_joy|> I'm happy to go without but if it's readily available then everyday.
"<|emo_sad|> I literally teared up reading this. That poor, poor guy. He has a great attitude, but that's heartbreaking."
<|emo_surprise|> Wonder if some of the ‘cuse guys we got because nobody was available anymore will be cycled out
<|emo_fear|> scared for sure... scared of how much money we're gonna have to pay him it's gonna be all the moneys
"<|emo_anger|> Ok, then what the actual fuck is your plan?"
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] and [NAME] were always goldmines. They had so little air time compared to the rest but whenever they were shown it was memorable
<|emo_joy|> Thanks Mate. [NAME] is awesome
<|emo_sad|> She refuses them by inhaling them [I'm sorry if that sounded bad plz no downvite]
"<|emo_joy|> Have you seen Lord's and Ladles on Netflix? It's not a competition, but the scenery and the little facts are super interesting."
<|emo_disgust|> What a fuckin n
<|emo_anger|> What in the fuck? Now is garbage!
<|emo_anger|> Holy shit bro
"<|emo_joy|> I just draw for the fun of it tbh... But having ""success"" or getting recognition still surely feels nice... Don't give up :)!"
"<|emo_surprise|> I find this super relateable, I had no idea others felt the same way. "
"<|emo_joy|> That's the best thing about free will, you don't need an excuse."
<|emo_anger|> A fucking power outage during a hurricane and your car is fucked.
"<|emo_fear|> As a democrat, even I am afraid of a super majority. "
<|emo_sad|> I'm so sorry! I hope you are doing better!
<|emo_joy|> So cute and there would be nothing with talking to her about it after and both being on the same page
"<|emo_fear|> This, in top of my already terrible mental health, is the reason why I'm severely underweight and need help."
<|emo_joy|> This was the most fun I've had watching a game since [NAME] 35 point game
"<|emo_sad|> I'll pass the ""I'm not crying you're crying!"" part. Yeah I'm crying. "
<|emo_joy|> lol this is good.
<|emo_joy|> Name one thing this person in power has said or done that’s racist. This should be fun..
<|emo_fear|> Worrying about [NAME] during a game is ridiculous. Especially when he's currently 6-11 from the field.
<|emo_joy|> I'm sorry to hear about what your sister did to you. I'm glad my videos could be of help!
"<|emo_sad|> Omg lmao. Coming from [NAME] too is super embarrassing. I can't really say I feel bad for [NAME] though, he did it to himself. "
"<|emo_surprise|> Look what time it is. It's Fuck You, It's January!"
<|emo_joy|> Happy New Year Everybody!
<|emo_anger|> Are you fucking serious? That’s a foul??
<|emo_joy|> Weird how they shoehorned s character from an ongoing tv show into Celebrity Big Brothter. Glad they got rid of him after one episode though.
<|emo_anger|> I could crush him like a bug right now.
<|emo_fear|> Fuck the rangers
<|emo_sad|> *blinded by the shill* I know like 2 people unfortunately..
"<|emo_joy|> It's good though because itll make you cherish the happy times while youre in them, instead of lookinf back on them."
<|emo_anger|> Who the hell cares
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] unborn grandchildren disliked that.
<|emo_sad|> He probably got hurt making the video
<|emo_disgust|> And you wonder why Labour get's a bad name for anti-Semitism with statements like that. Ok hun.
<|emo_anger|> I'm just here to say fuck [NAME]
"<|emo_joy|> Glad I could help. Feels good once in a while, I know the feeling."
"<|emo_joy|> I enjoy the harsh throat hit, reminds me of cigs. Edit: Mango is still my favorite though."
<|emo_sad|> Girl I got you. guys haven’t experienced culture where basically every girl calls herself fat or tries to restrict their eating because they have insecurity or dysmorphia
<|emo_joy|> Lol... that is awesome.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my *FUCKING* **GOD**!!
"<|emo_surprise|> Ah, pillars of society. No wonder MLS is so highly regarded."
<|emo_fear|> The left side attack of [NAME] [NAME] was woeful
<|emo_surprise|> Our o-line was great outside of 2 games this year. My [NAME] did you even watch or pay attention to this team this year?
<|emo_surprise|> Is this [NAME]?
<|emo_fear|> Imagine if we dont trade [NAME] and [NAME] fans just kill all of us.
<|emo_anger|> Read divorce busting and kill all marriage counselors. As much as it sucks...youve been given a gift by him giving you time.
"<|emo_disgust|> >the ad, which has been both criticised and applauded Applauded by non-customers. Criticized by customers."
"<|emo_sad|> As a former [NAME], I apologize. That’s tough"
"<|emo_joy|> Born and raised on Long Island, kidnapped by my wife now living in Cleveland, Ohio."
<|emo_anger|> What the hell kind of university schedules a class at 6am?
"<|emo_disgust|> Nope! His real name starts with a G. Weird spelling of a common name, and pretty identifiable so I’ve never wanted to use it 🙃"
<|emo_joy|> When are people going to learn that it's OK to cheer lead dance in front of an old misogynist lol
<|emo_disgust|> Terfs smell like bigots in general. Sort of a salty smell
<|emo_surprise|> Exactly. How that woman has survived two no confidence votes amazes me.
<|emo_sad|> Sick of that stupid floss dance
<|emo_fear|> That was an horrendous season to an otherwise amazing show
<|emo_anger|> The number of pedos is too damn high!
<|emo_disgust|> The worst is ‘get in a group with someone you don’t already know’
<|emo_disgust|> He would say Shut up about the sun I don’t think he likes space.
<|emo_sad|> Absolutely. I have 3 kids with this woman. My guilt is compounded because I will be tearing their worlds apart too.
<|emo_joy|> ... Still laughed!
<|emo_joy|> It's interesting that they don't know to take the handset off the hook before dialing.
"<|emo_anger|> Wow, “Social” Democrats betraying the revolution. Who would had guessed?"
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] and [NAME] were amazingly cute when both were in their awkward phase where no one had the guts to step forward.
<|emo_anger|> # Breeeeeeak me off a piece of that apple sauce!
<|emo_disgust|> Not everyone left of you is a lib. You're arrogant.
<|emo_sad|> Getting tougher to make those mortgage **and** car payments.
<|emo_fear|> Omg this.. completely relatable and depressing.. yay for us.
<|emo_joy|> Oh man this gave me some flashbacks to awesome times playing with my dad
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] line of drool made me very happy I waited to watch this til I was eating dinner i love the power hour so much
"<|emo_sad|> Sadly, he seems immune to bans. He also dodges them with alts like [NAME]"
"<|emo_surprise|>  looks unreal, like it's a toy or something."
"<|emo_anger|> That's still a fucking insane number. 70% is goddamn insanity, and the only reason you're alright with it is because you're unaffected."
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] dammit I love wrestling
"<|emo_anger|> If a woman forces a man's penis into her vagina, that ABSOLUTELY IS a crime. Not sure what you're smoking. "
<|emo_fear|> Same. All other map on OG with SSD were fine. [NAME] drops and it's terrible.
"<|emo_fear|> What a horrible way to find out, though. My sympathies to the dead man."
<|emo_surprise|> What? I didn’t understand a thing of what you said.
<|emo_surprise|> OH MY [NAME]
<|emo_joy|> my favourite kind of cookies.
"<|emo_anger|> if he ended up with that chef, damn that will break my heart for sure."
"<|emo_anger|> Oh wow, hate that. "
<|emo_surprise|> This is amazing. WTF.
<|emo_anger|> Fuck her. I hate her so much. I wish she’s just vanish back to Indonesia with her mustache.
<|emo_disgust|> Their hands must've been sweaty.
<|emo_disgust|> We also blame their money
<|emo_joy|> So we got Summer’s model now. Team STRQ flashbacks next volume?
<|emo_disgust|> I regret this post so hard so much debate and anger lol
<|emo_sad|> And then [NAME] heroically murders them and hangs up their heads so he can feel like a real boy
<|emo_fear|> Oh [NAME] if I was 9 and my parents did that I would cringe real hard
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] combat is terrible and the only reason I don’t play it anymore
<|emo_sad|> Absolutely. It's exhausting.
<|emo_anger|> Putting any human on the same level as [NAME] is sacrilegious and you should be ashamed for spreading such blasphemy.
<|emo_joy|> You welcome guys
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow dad, you took a baptismal for me"
<|emo_joy|> That’s good to hear..I’m so worried I’ll be making the wrong choice by leaving my job I hate soon.
"<|emo_sad|> No one to blame here, bad luck is what it is."
"<|emo_disgust|> From what im seeing. ""The democrats can stop this if they just let him build the wall. Its their fault."""
<|emo_disgust|> Completely disgusting.
"<|emo_surprise|> It's strange i don't understand how work reddit, i drop a link when i create a post but it doesn't work"
<|emo_sad|> *[NAME] playing the world's saddest tune on the world's biggest violin.*
<|emo_anger|> Mental illness. Operation on 7 people in a manic state . Four of them died. All his money was gone and his rich friends abandoned him.
<|emo_sad|> I’m sorry friend. I actually used to be pretty good with this but I’m constantly getting worse.
<|emo_sad|> I’m crying omfg
"<|emo_sad|> I feel bad for house slaves, even if it's in their understandable self-interest. "
<|emo_sad|> So many of Pokimane’s fans are creepy 30+ year olds. I feel so bad for her.
"<|emo_fear|> That sounds like it was an absolute nightmare, I'm sorry you had to go through that, anesthetic failing is a horrifying experience. "
"<|emo_joy|> I'm genuinely interested in the responses to this but lmao at ""pork salivary glands"" Edit: sweet username"
<|emo_joy|> Nervously laughs in anxiety
<|emo_anger|> They are angry virgin children because he plays the game like it was supposed to be played. SOT has the most pathetic community ever.
<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit did this sub just get wholesome for a second?
<|emo_joy|> you are delucional.
<|emo_anger|> I DEMAND TO BE PUT ON A PEDASTAL AND TREATED LIKE A QUEEN IF NOT I WILL SEEK VALIDATION ELSEWHERE AND ALL THIS IS YOUR FAULT
<|emo_anger|> That sucks. But you can find another SO. You can't unhave a kid.
<|emo_joy|> Oh hey I have those jeans
<|emo_surprise|> Heyyy that's the chair i'm sitting in right now at my home office!
"<|emo_joy|> You know I never thought I'd celebrate someone's death, but once she goes I'm going to have to try very hard to not enjoy it..."
"<|emo_surprise|> Breaking news, husband borrows wife's car and should lose their job because of this"
<|emo_anger|> End this relationship NOW. And please learn from it!!
<|emo_disgust|> My own worst enemy singalong is my favorite LOL
<|emo_anger|> Fuck you.
"<|emo_joy|> As sure as gods got sandals, it sure beats fighting dudes with treasure trails"
<|emo_joy|> So word is we have eyes on [NAME]... I would be pretty amped to see him with a Jet on his shirt.
<|emo_anger|> Then I'll be accused of being a racist.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, Michelin star for $25. That's nuts. Thanks for the heads up. "
<|emo_surprise|> Holy crap! A stunning play by mentally ill newcomer u/justforyouthlogic
"<|emo_disgust|> thats the future right there, robots trying to help but destroying your whole home in the process. "
<|emo_joy|> I was just gonna post this haha. My fave my part
<|emo_surprise|> DAMN I CAN NOT BELIEVE IT
<|emo_anger|> I have a deep seeded hatred for close-minded people too.
<|emo_joy|> And other hilarious lies you can tell yourself...
<|emo_joy|> Oh thanks I didn’t pay really attention haha
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my good lord. I just somethinged over his highlight reel.
<|emo_surprise|> It's no surprise that the fat and ugly trolls with despicable personalities are the ones against nuclear families. Add a dash of racism for good measure.
<|emo_joy|> Fidget spinners are cool again
<|emo_sad|> What a catastrophe.
"<|emo_fear|> Gonna warn you, that path is a lot more dangerous than you would think..."
<|emo_anger|> It's nothing on you. I just hate the idea from a justice standpoint. I strive for fairness as much as I'm able.
"<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing about this is, there is a good joke hiding deep down somewhere. Someone just used a jackhammer to retrieve it"
<|emo_anger|> Get out asap.
<|emo_surprise|> Daddy issues [NAME]
<|emo_surprise|> A volley into a header. Just wow. The skills.
<|emo_joy|> Funny never not will be this.
<|emo_anger|> What the fuck are you talking about
<|emo_joy|> I'm just happy anybody's talking to me. I'll listen again :-)
<|emo_joy|> Why go to the moon when you can *BECOME THE MOON*
<|emo_sad|> somebody's sad lol lol
<|emo_joy|> I sure hope so! Smug bastards!
<|emo_anger|> FUCK NO NOT FUCKING AGAIN
<|emo_anger|> You shouldn't force someone to come out you know. Now look at what you did! You killed [NAME]! You bastard!
"<|emo_disgust|> But it's different, they're not rich because of those darn immigrants, otherwise they'd be a billionaire!"
"<|emo_surprise|> Hey, it's working again! Somebody at YouTube must have given the server a whack, because suddenly the recommendations are making sense. I wonder what happened today."
<|emo_anger|> Which suggests nothing in itself. The same mods you claim are abusive are probably as hyperbolic about the racism issue as you are.
<|emo_sad|> That is incredibly disheartening.
<|emo_anger|> I hate this and I love you for sharing it
"<|emo_anger|> Just like you can't underestimate the capacity for evil, you can't underestimate the capacity for stupidity "
"<|emo_fear|> Omg, unbelievably scary. Insane "
<|emo_anger|> I hated doing group work. Unless groups were assigned I always went by myself.
"<|emo_disgust|> Oh trust me, I thought of that - but I felt as though the phallic shape would cheapen the resemblance to feces "
"<|emo_sad|> Fair enough. I typically focus more on the lower bound because I hate when people use ""millennials"" as a synonym for ""youths."" "
<|emo_anger|> It's shameful that he has to preface this post with his bias. Couldn't just leave well enough alone.
<|emo_anger|> 1. They don't understand football fundamentals. They play [NAME]. 2. They are short and want someone to identify with.
<|emo_surprise|> Would not be surprised tbh.
<|emo_disgust|> That was so disgusting. VWP
"<|emo_surprise|> Omg what the ever loving bloody hell did I just read?? As an artist, this was extra painful to me."
"<|emo_anger|> I just don't want to see them shame themselves, and actually show their worth and virtue instead of showing themsleves to be a walking sexual object"
"<|emo_joy|> All fair enough, but you should start just cleaning your dishes straight after you use them. You'll be much happier."
<|emo_anger|> Don't fucking disrespect the World's Largest Love Machine ever again
<|emo_sad|> I don't like sleeping in the couch :(
"<|emo_joy|> Hell, I'm saving your Reply. Enjoy being the first in my list!"
<|emo_disgust|> Man they must really hate [NAME] out of position at SF. But let’s play [NAME] at SF that should work.
<|emo_anger|> Sucks when people misunderstand philosophy right
"<|emo_fear|> No. Hell no. It's ""anxiety"". When needed for medical notes and such my doctor will also write anxiety. "
"<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what was more painful, the stitches or the humiliation."
<|emo_disgust|> Somebody's obnoxious.
<|emo_disgust|> Right before that he called [NAME] for getting barged in the back and nearly kicked in the face. Weird performance. Didn't change the result mind
<|emo_disgust|> Are all the people in that thread praising SB2...SB2? They all talk in a similar manner. It's odd.
<|emo_joy|> That'd be amazing! Heard about Newington's reno not long ago. Need to get over there.
<|emo_anger|> Kindly shut your pie hole.
<|emo_sad|> Agree on the last point. My INTP friend's ENFP is immature since she's still young. Gets jealous at every damn girl that approaches... Sigh
<|emo_sad|> Ok this New England accent not so fun!!
"<|emo_fear|> Any time the results are known before the hypothesis is generated, you should be very skeptical of the methods."
<|emo_joy|> Interesting. I’m not a troll.But if it makes you feel better...
"<|emo_sad|> No he was given a bad team to work with unfortunately, and never got the final shot he deserved :("
<|emo_anger|> Shout out to all the homes putting in work on the at marvel/dbfz
"<|emo_disgust|> The zoo is the reason we HAVE tiggers, goddamnit"
<|emo_sad|> Im sorry dude. Drumming Octopuss.
<|emo_anger|> “Love” under threat of execution. Wow.
<|emo_fear|> As someone else has mentioned it is not theft technically. So that will probably only cause more problems for myself.
<|emo_fear|> I had so many bad Supercuts haircuts that I cringe when I look at the place and go to a fancy schmancy salon exclusively.
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah, my mom would tell at and hit our family dog. She was a tiny little dog too. :("
<|emo_surprise|> It’s shocking if you’re a bad electrician.
<|emo_sad|> You and your lovable band of losers have already lost!
<|emo_joy|> I'm so glad you got your angel back. Also she is trying to monopolize DHs free time.
<|emo_surprise|> I'm excited as a Lions fan.
<|emo_disgust|> Ah what a bummer! Better kill them herons & spoonbills!
"<|emo_disgust|> Too long, you gotta cut along the top of the cargo pockets."
<|emo_fear|> One of the scariest things about being in a cult is that you don't realize you're in a cult.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wait, WHAT?!?!"
<|emo_sad|> Well ya but it's kinda too late for that unfortunately
<|emo_surprise|> It’s indicating his uncles death wasn’t a accident and he died for a specific reason such as conspiracy
<|emo_disgust|> can't wait to catch me one of them suckers
<|emo_anger|> I hate Twitter more and more each day....the people on there are so toxic it literally makes me sick. They can't appreciate a good meme.
<|emo_joy|> Lol okay. It's not like they're billion dollar organizations that have their own personal agenda. Fine. Enjoy your bubble.
"<|emo_disgust|> I swear, this is the most brutal one of this year yet. "
"<|emo_fear|> They asked him twice about Bayern and he just kept saying he can't talk about it, so not very reassuring really."
<|emo_sad|> I’m thinking it’s from when she was abused when she was pregnant and lost the baby.
<|emo_fear|> Yeah until the last one has creepily wed and reproduced.
<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised everyone seems to think there will be a season 2.
"<|emo_disgust|> Doesnt matter where it happened, retail companys will find any excuse to throw their employies under the bus"
<|emo_surprise|> Just wondering why they called the cops but not an ambulance seeing as how he was covered in blood and disoriented.
<|emo_surprise|> Omg saucepan what a daring and unconventional look!!!11
"<|emo_anger|> Democrat politician, my bad should have specified. We are mostly all “liberals” here even if we’ve been alienated on this issue."
<|emo_joy|> It’s always nice to say something [nice]!
<|emo_joy|> That sounds delicious! Looks like I’m making a trip to the supermarket today.
<|emo_sad|> My condolences.
<|emo_surprise|> My organs love me. I wonder how emotionally damaged a person has to be to come up with these. It's weird and sad.
<|emo_anger|> Really sucks that he's not going to retire a Sounder.
<|emo_joy|> Aye but happy cake day mate.
<|emo_joy|> Good to know! *Makes note to Grand Revenge Scheme draft 2.doc to only slash three of the ex's tires*
<|emo_anger|> LOL how can anyone trust you when you pretend that you voted for [NAME] when your clearly racist against blacks. Your user name is strictly a lie.
"<|emo_fear|> Horrendous , this is also reflected in my experience act school where you are not allowed to defend yourself at all "
<|emo_sad|> I work on a farm. I can confirm can be dangerous. I have a hard time imagining a scenario where being a cop is more dangerous.
<|emo_sad|> Oh my [NAME] I completely didn’t realise. I’m so sorry
<|emo_joy|> Sounds good.
"<|emo_anger|> Boy just tell her to ""calm down"" or ""watch her tone"" and get it over with."
<|emo_joy|> Good for you man. Enjoy.
<|emo_surprise|> I didn't know that newborn babies eat and breathe through an umbilical cord. TIL.
<|emo_surprise|> hmmm so pretty much the same as the last 25 years.
"<|emo_sad|> My favorite pod when they are fresh & clear. Sadly, all of my recent packs look like dark brown syrup pods. "
<|emo_joy|> Best day of the week!
<|emo_fear|> I feel his pain. Bad dxm trips are the most terrifying thing in the moment but they're way more forgiving than bad psych trips
<|emo_joy|> I watch it every time I see it posted. There's something beautiful about watching someone so passionate and excited about what they've discovered :)
"<|emo_joy|> Yes! I play both, because I like the combat of one and everything else in the other."
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow. This I definitely needed, I'm glad I stumbled onto your comment. Helped in a major way, thanks. "
<|emo_joy|> This is amazing and exactly how I feel about him. I love [NAME] and [NAME] but this is why Nuge is my favourite NUGE IS HUUUUUUUGE
<|emo_anger|> You’re a nut if you don’t think the pubs are far more corrupt than the dems.
"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, chairs can communicate with eachother now? What a time to be alive!"
"<|emo_anger|> Verisimilitude, which here means, utter bs meant to help justify terrible favouritism."
<|emo_fear|> We are killing this planet
<|emo_disgust|> Damn I WANT to hear this!!!
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME] funny, girl.. not so much "
"<|emo_anger|> Take your upvote, you no good bastard."
<|emo_disgust|> Both are weird.
"<|emo_surprise|> ""Oh my [NAME] who is he? I get drunk on jealousy"" -[NAME]-"
<|emo_anger|> *Fuck extremists.
<|emo_joy|> Oh the joys of Marine Corps boot camp!!
<|emo_disgust|> That’s very creepy and weird. Hopefully this pup was not being carted around with ulterior motives.
<|emo_joy|> I already like the game. I don't to make the wins gimmicky for the game to be fun.
<|emo_anger|> Fuck me daddy
<|emo_fear|> You are right and why you get downvoted?
<|emo_sad|> Well 216 is out now and Im crying. [NAME] why?
"<|emo_joy|> Ahhh, the ol' Samsung Special. "
"<|emo_joy|> Ironically, everyone else (except a v small%) are thinking the same, try keeping this in mind next time.. enjoy your day"
<|emo_surprise|> Wow thanks. Didn’t know there were any others glad to hear
"<|emo_disgust|> Nobody will ever dethrone nurses and teachers, but hotel employees are quietly becoming some of the weirdest people in my Tinder matches."
<|emo_disgust|> i love it but i hate everything around it. I want to theorycraft a deck with all the cards i want without having to spend money.
"<|emo_sad|> College is a very lonely place. Very stressful, very lonely. [NAME]. Good luck out there man."
"<|emo_surprise|> I DON'T BELIEVE, WHAT I JUST SAW"
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah, that's why I feel [NAME] or [NAME] would have a better chance."
<|emo_disgust|> You would know if you weren't such a Filthy Ricefield Peasant.
<|emo_surprise|> I thought that was more for women? I used to be on r/antinatalism but there were too many eugenics advocates.
<|emo_anger|> I hate that myself
<|emo_joy|> I want to get off [NAME] wild ride
<|emo_sad|> The ones that actually think he's worse than [NAME] also thinki its ok to raise their kids genderless.
<|emo_fear|> Wait for real? That's how they met? lol that's both terrifying and completely fitting considering how nuts they both are
<|emo_disgust|> No matter what you choose (if you even have a choice) you can rest assured it will be fairly slow and very overpriced.
<|emo_surprise|> Okay. The wall that he's mentioning. What wall would that be? ***on the border?? Oh my! Big surprise***
<|emo_anger|> No wonder why their logo always looks pissed
"<|emo_joy|> Glad to see [NAME] getting a point, he's been overdue. Now for the 3rd period [NAME]? "
<|emo_sad|> I CANNOT WITH THESE COMMERCIALS
<|emo_joy|> I enjoy being a girl. (are shutdown memes still allowed? ...No matter. Couldn't find a decent one for this)
<|emo_fear|> You will never be safe as long as the CCP can imprison and torture you
<|emo_anger|> WAIT IS THIS FUCKING LOSS!?!
<|emo_joy|> I recently got a job that I wanted so now I don't have to live paycheck to paycheck.
"<|emo_surprise|> Even though it should level out, it's still currently having major detrimental impacts on the environment and human suffering "
<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit!!
<|emo_anger|> It didnt fuck up his career at all. Hes got thousands of ravenous fangirls and still makes absolute bank.
<|emo_sad|> Offense does too. Love [NAME] but he's hurting our spacing being out there so much.
<|emo_anger|> Amazing shitpost.
<|emo_sad|> Is there any way to somebody can please translate the notes into doc form or something? I am having trouble viewing them :(
<|emo_disgust|> What's the cringe?
<|emo_fear|> I’m about to have a heart attack tonight
<|emo_sad|> You die > mom will be sad
<|emo_anger|> Neither is beating people up
"<|emo_anger|> Shut up, [NAME]. "
<|emo_sad|> Because our democracy is not going to be held hostage by terrorists
<|emo_joy|> He gets to watch boxing for free and get paid for it. It's probably his dream job. I'm happy for him! :)
<|emo_anger|> Quit being a crybaby. If this how you handle any criticism then it's no wonder you're alone and will be for quite some time
<|emo_anger|> Get out. And take your facts with you.
"<|emo_sad|> Unfortunately, successful and rich people blame foreigners too :("
<|emo_sad|> Best of luck to you too. sorry to hear that. Here's to No contact!!
<|emo_disgust|> It's not G A M E R time unless we get to berate women and minorities.
"<|emo_sad|> Another bad essay by me, sorry for butchering anarchism, anti-ableism and anti-psychiatry but I hope I got the point across :p"
"<|emo_joy|> I don't filter it out because I enjoy my daily cringe from the constant open letters. ""To the ____ who ____"""
<|emo_sad|> This mode is dead. Sorry :/
<|emo_joy|> I knew I'd see him here eventually. I really like his animations. They're cute and funny
<|emo_anger|> Our education system has been a complete and utter failure...
<|emo_anger|> FBI OPEN UP!!!!
<|emo_sad|> I feel genuine sorrow for your family having to be associated with a cretin such as yourself
"<|emo_disgust|> >Downvote me, you cowards."
"<|emo_surprise|> Whoa, settle down big texter!!!! Not even sure how that happened?"
<|emo_anger|> Likely just a scam
<|emo_surprise|> Oh god. Imagine losing to Toronto in the cup final. You would spent the rest of your life hearing about it
"<|emo_joy|> Lol that’s incredible! PLO is such an amazing game, so much more entertaining than NLH. Good job pal. "
"<|emo_disgust|> Sir, you have been warned. You antagonistic attitude will not be tolerated. Please try harder at being a model citizen. Thank you for your cooperation."
<|emo_anger|> Right now it sucks ass I gotta squat in snow in the freezing cold in the back yard of my apartment complex holding a little bong
"<|emo_anger|> DEAD DUCK INSIDE DO NOT EAT. Well, I’m not sure what I expected. "
<|emo_joy|> Happy cake day
"<|emo_anger|> Damn, even here in CA the gun haters almost invariably exempt law enforcement from their crusade."
<|emo_anger|> Absolutely insane documentary. I actually thought it was a parody at one point but it’s all real.
"<|emo_anger|> Go lie somewhere else. Go to Faux News or something. They,ll believe you."
<|emo_disgust|> Hate them. I really don't need to hear about you pissing your pants in the first grade.
<|emo_anger|> Soooo [NAME] is f**ked
<|emo_anger|> Yet here you are mad about [NAME] being apathetic.
<|emo_fear|> I’m afraid too. It’s the not knowing what will happen that scares me.
<|emo_anger|> QB Coach too? Shit..
<|emo_sad|> That poor snek :’(
<|emo_anger|> MORE LIKE [NAME]
<|emo_surprise|> What a snake. Typical Fort Mcmurray politics.
<|emo_sad|> I laughed harder than I should have at this reply. Then the sadness hit me when I realized it wasn't meant to be funny.
<|emo_joy|> So good to see him and good to see he’s doing well! I’ve missed him.
"<|emo_sad|> I walked 500 miles and then I walked 500 more, you can’t relate to my pain 😤"
"<|emo_disgust|> Considered going for the 1st time this year, then I see all the ads targeting kids specifically. Feels weird as a 26 year old seeing all this.."
<|emo_disgust|> Why I left the industry... it’s full of hipsters who don’t realize they’re hipsters. That was worse than the slave labor.
<|emo_disgust|> Ive just given up. Learning to become selfish.
<|emo_anger|> Ahhh more and more selfish
"<|emo_disgust|> At least he was polite - ""please"" fuck off! "
<|emo_surprise|> For a moment there I thought I was the only one! Pretty awesome and I had no idea
"<|emo_sad|> [NAME] passing is worse than usual. It's alright, but god damn is it painful to watch."
"<|emo_joy|> Alas, Windows, so I'll go a-hunting. Thanks for the info, though!"
<|emo_joy|> I actually enjoy doing this on my own. Am I weird?
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah this bothers me. Family should be off limits, and this scene was really sad"
<|emo_sad|> This should be the norm instead of the exception. Sadly the leaders in law enforcement are almost always more into politics than principles.
<|emo_sad|> I had so many avatars named after Star Wars characters on Millsbury. I miss it 😭😭😭
<|emo_joy|> >Relax ms bi weeb who leans left haha... thanks i love it
<|emo_sad|> Thanks I was worried that I might die alone
<|emo_surprise|> What really? I cant believe no one has ever said that before! You may have saved my life.
"<|emo_anger|> Duress I tell you, it was done under duress!! "
<|emo_joy|> Hard to believe we scored like 8 points through the first 6 minutes.
<|emo_anger|> Too bad that's not the case. I'm happy I'll one day die.
<|emo_anger|> People at alphabet freaking out rn
<|emo_disgust|> It's just a natural reaction of people blaming white people as a whole for all the bad things in history.
<|emo_disgust|> What? Who said I hated him? I dont give a damn about him either way.
"<|emo_disgust|> Troll, bro. They know they're saying stupid shit. The motherfucker does nothing but stink up libertarian subs talking shit"
<|emo_joy|> And the apartment is clean! You can see the floor!
"<|emo_fear|> No, that’s just another way of backing a coup. Sit back and wait. If either side is going too far then offer to help."
<|emo_joy|> Happy cake day friend
"<|emo_joy|> Because they enjoy their toxic umoderated cesspool, apparently. Either way i'm done trying to care."
"<|emo_disgust|> ""These people didn't go to my church therefore they are demonic"""
<|emo_joy|> Pity because I enjoyed Max Normal.
<|emo_joy|> Then do it [NAME]. It's basketball. You can do whatever you want out there.
<|emo_fear|> I've also heard that intriguing but also kinda scary
<|emo_disgust|> I knoooow like why do people exist just to make things worse I’m so tired of all these alts/ weird question askers
"<|emo_anger|> They’ve changed their mind so clearly they would change their position when scrutinised. Like you said though, he was ignored. "
<|emo_joy|> Ahhhh the good old anecdote
<|emo_joy|> Hahaha thanks for sharing that is simply amazing. You probably gave the buyer a good laugh too.
"<|emo_disgust|> This sounds an awful lot like a solicitation. In case it isn't, what you seek may exist but you'd probably have better luck with the lottery."
<|emo_anger|> A fucking centaur
<|emo_disgust|> Worst deal on the leafs right now easily
<|emo_sad|> I’m broke as shit and already do that.
<|emo_joy|> Pistons gonna have to part with something the fans don't wanna give up. Haha
"<|emo_surprise|> Ouch, my heart. I never even thought about this..."
<|emo_sad|> >It's not that I care Every reply now is you crying about being downvoted lol
<|emo_joy|> Glad to see those refs from the Rams/Saints game landed new jobs in WWE.
<|emo_joy|> Hope your mum gets well soon. Enjoy Saturday!
"<|emo_anger|> Also worth noting that OP was the racist, violent instigator in that situation."
<|emo_anger|> The only life that needs to be ended here is the life of the guy that raped your daughter. Abortion is just medicine
<|emo_joy|> I’m happy I can help.
<|emo_joy|> I see. Thanks again for taking the time. I'm very isolated from the world so It's good to finally talk to someone about those things.
<|emo_fear|> Sorry I meant to link it but completely forgot :>
<|emo_disgust|> Apparently [NAME] is realizing that it looks bad when he isn't performing governance duties.
"<|emo_anger|> Hmm, I understand your frustration then"
<|emo_disgust|> This might be the worst FO in Orlando magic history
<|emo_joy|> I mean I'm no fan of the series either but who cares? It makes a lot of people happy.
<|emo_surprise|> Omg i probably need to get mint to drop some truth bombs
<|emo_joy|> *The Daily Wire.* Lol.
"<|emo_fear|> Or maybe he does, and that’s why he scared of people thinking that; he’s afraid of people finding them out."
<|emo_disgust|> ah Yuk!
<|emo_surprise|> You need to lable your factors or else this is indecipherable.
<|emo_joy|> That’s awesome news! Welcome to the family!
"<|emo_joy|> Im glad you took that step. Sometimes its really hard making that decision, but im glad you didnt force yourself to be miserable"
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] continues to be my god while I continue to be banned by Swery. ^^Seriously, ^^what ^^did ^^I ^^do?"
<|emo_fear|> That destroys honor tho right ??
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah, assuming what he said is true yes he has a chance, but it's hard to say for sure given the circumstances "
<|emo_sad|> Someone should make a religion out of this
<|emo_joy|> I really love how this team responds to injuries
<|emo_anger|> EMAO fats (Eat my ass off)
<|emo_sad|> Nooooooooo. I wanted to see what he could do.
<|emo_anger|> This draft is one man deep tbh. Not getting Zion would be devastating and a waste of a whole year.
<|emo_anger|> stupid science bitches
<|emo_joy|> Do whatever you want if/until you have kids. Just stay safe.
<|emo_joy|> Same here. My refund almost doubled from last year. I almost cried when I saw how much I'm getting back.
<|emo_fear|> There are some amazingly cringey compilations of terrible dialogue from this show on yt
<|emo_joy|> I think I’d take the long view - the good news is that at least she’s not pregnant...
<|emo_anger|> * Fuck [NAME] * Yes
<|emo_joy|> I’m glad I’m not the only one who thought that.
<|emo_disgust|> that this ridiculous comparison is this detailed and explicit makes me think the whole beating-a-little-girl-thing is part of his disgusting sexual fantasies.
<|emo_anger|> Oh go fuck yourself with your BS generalization.
"<|emo_anger|> obviously, its just a stupid question"
<|emo_sad|> I’m offended
<|emo_disgust|> It's also ridiculously removed from reality. Dying to a disease or injury from an accident is orders of magnitude more likely than getting shot.
<|emo_joy|> Happy Easter everyone!!
<|emo_sad|> What’d he say?? I want to be in on his shame!
"<|emo_sad|> Damn it, I only have 6 comments on this sub, I don’t qualify😞"
<|emo_sad|> This is really scary. The saddest about this is i really think it will be possible quite soon. :(
<|emo_joy|> Good luck and have fun
"<|emo_joy|> I'm so happy for you and so, so, so proud of you. It's HARD to talk to your doctor about this stuff."
<|emo_surprise|> I was surprised too
<|emo_anger|> ye but that is fucking [NAME]... there is a diffrence between [NAME] and [NAME]. [NAME] is good but he is no [NAME] ;)
"<|emo_anger|> You’re an animal, and you deserve all the shame/repercussions you get."
<|emo_surprise|> Wonder what [NAME] [NAME] thinks about all this
"<|emo_anger|> Those are different, you don't tie that shit to the weakest part, they just stay on there by magic"
<|emo_anger|> he ded.... and why the fuck these POSs have cellphones in prison.
<|emo_sad|> I unfortunately can not afford a lawyer. Luckily the only thing that we shared is our daughter
<|emo_surprise|> OH MY GOD!!!! The poor parents must have gone from gutted to PISSED in a matter of moments.
<|emo_sad|> I'm sad can someone make me feel better Feel like shit rn just want [NAME] back
<|emo_sad|> There's something deeply ironic about spoil tagging this
<|emo_anger|> It's not his job to train you.
<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting.
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] that was so awful I collapsed into a singularity
"<|emo_anger|> The username makes it even better, sucking a dudes toes, who is [NAME]. Man I'm jealous "
"<|emo_anger|> Aren’t property owners responsible for clearing sidewalks in front? The bike lanes are part of the roadway, and thus under the city’s jurisdiction."
<|emo_surprise|> I would be surprised if [NAME] doesn't let you in. I would write a letter to [NAME] and explain the situation they might make an exception.
<|emo_fear|> Beyond nightmare!!
<|emo_disgust|> I didn't say remain was left wing. I said the E.U acts as a buffer against the most insane and cruel Tory policies.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I wish we had info on which counties have it the worst. Was that in the article?"
<|emo_anger|> Looks like you've never been to Paris! The worst toilet in UK is cleaner than Paris.
<|emo_surprise|> Seriously beautiful my man!! Is it on apple music? Really great song
<|emo_anger|> lol dont try and fucking blame [NAME] for not passing it to a guy who has been bricking all night.
<|emo_joy|> oh is that it
<|emo_anger|> So you reject your ideology's premise that you can just protect yourself.
"<|emo_anger|> Lmao ""guys I was *coerced* into sending her a picture of my junk"". That just sounds dumb as hell "
"<|emo_surprise|> Well, whaddaya know!"
<|emo_anger|> THAT'S WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU FIND A STRANGER IN THE ALPS
<|emo_anger|> > but to say that it will fuck up your mind is simply ignorant lolol k.
"<|emo_disgust|> You can't just say the word ""disinterest"" and expect anything to happen"
"<|emo_sad|> I've gone through phases like that, usually related to depression or something else going on in my life. See if it passes in a couple weeks."
"<|emo_anger|> Low effort bait, not even creative or funny."
"<|emo_anger|> Fuck me, that is good. "
<|emo_fear|> That's a hot pic Shame she'll kill us all
"<|emo_anger|> You don't even provide a verifiable example, why should I accept your evidence."
<|emo_joy|> She finally found home
"<|emo_sad|> I'm the first one, so that's wrong. Party affiliation =/= political leaning"
<|emo_anger|> Fucking Synths. -[NAME]
<|emo_anger|> it's funny how conservatives always say that leftists get angry over everything when conservatives get angry over a starbucks cup or a brown man existing
<|emo_anger|> I want to taste their tears
"<|emo_joy|> Not gonna lie, I LOVE pneumatic tubes. This is now my next vacation plan."
"<|emo_disgust|> “WTF, He helped me? ...I’ll eat him last :)”"
<|emo_sad|> YPG has carried out numerous attacks. Yet you seem to judge them on the few messed up things they have done.
<|emo_sad|> Drunk and crying in bed with my pets. :|
"<|emo_anger|> Removed, stop trolling."
<|emo_disgust|> I'll take the downvotes and agree with you. Some of the ugliest looking things I've ever seen. Absolutely disgusting aesthetic.
"<|emo_disgust|> Lmao ""guys I was *coerced* into sending her a picture of my junk"". That just sounds dumb as hell "
<|emo_anger|> Fuck the rangers
<|emo_sad|> > traffic through there in the summer is awful because that’s where everyone wants to be. your life starts to revolve around bridge time.
<|emo_anger|> When people bring up rape culture they mean stuff like this. Because yeah it’s been out and swept away and not raged over
<|emo_anger|> Stop saying that ? Makes my tummy upset 🤢🤮
<|emo_sad|> I miss [NAME] and [NAME]. :(
<|emo_surprise|> Omg its hannibal cooper
"<|emo_surprise|> If you ever wondered where ISIS got their method of killing homosexuals, wonder no more. Source: al-Jawab al-Kafi p. 260-263 as Quoted by Islamqa: "
<|emo_joy|> I like [NAME] and I've heard good things about [NAME] (I think his name is).
"<|emo_joy|> Not all comedy is for everyone. Check out some of their other stuff, though. They're overall hilarious."
<|emo_sad|> just read to chapter 216 and im heartbroken i hope they fix this...
"<|emo_disgust|> If he hits you and constantly degrades you, it's abuse"
"<|emo_fear|> You know when I typed ""legal tender"" I had a horrible feeling I was going down a rabbit hole."
"<|emo_disgust|> Even if you were a woman, your personality is so vile and yuck I would happily do 20 years in prison for murdering you."
"<|emo_anger|> fuck lacy evens, she has not been impressive at all"
<|emo_sad|> Spent time with them. Argue with them. Laugh with them. Cry with them. We all get lonely when we are old.
<|emo_anger|> Same. About as Libertarian as fucking [NAME].
"<|emo_sad|> The EU's 'red lines' are in treaty and legislation. The UK's red lines are just May's opinions, they could disappear in two minutes."
<|emo_disgust|> You like [NAME] but dislike [NAME]? That is weird considering that they both are on the same low level of intelligence.
"<|emo_surprise|> Examples of useless government entities, little buddy."
"<|emo_anger|> Oh damn, look at that areshole telling the truth. Get him."
"<|emo_disgust|> Idk why everyone's being obnoxious. I thought this was a good post, OP."
<|emo_joy|> Look at that subtle colouring. The tasteful thickness. Oh my [NAME]. It even has a watermark.
"<|emo_joy|> Its actually ""[NAME]"" , not ""[NAME]"".. Sounds like a drunk to me. Glad to hear nothing horrible happened "
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME].
<|emo_joy|> A video that makes me happy
<|emo_anger|> thanks i hate her
"<|emo_anger|> uh, i don't see the correlation between tons of rape and murders in Georgia and the rich needing to be taxed more, but i do agree."
"<|emo_sad|> That sounds really agonising, to ask for help and have no one hear you. What's going on for you right now?"
<|emo_sad|> This is straight up depressing
<|emo_disgust|> That is so sad. So your sisters got to ruin their bodies and forego a career? Yikes.
<|emo_sad|> Please. Sorry.
<|emo_sad|> that number 3 is soooo familiar and sad.
<|emo_fear|> OLD can be a dangerous place. Gotta stay safe somehow!
<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. Thanks! So this person was going for that.
<|emo_surprise|> He's only making like 3M more than [NAME] this year wow

<|emo_joy|> Hahahaha!! I was thinking the exact same thing. But you could really feel the excitement while reading! 10/10
<|emo_anger|> Don’t blame us because you’re a dumbass..
"<|emo_sad|> Well, at least she broke up first. It would somehow be worse if she kept it hidden and brought him the news later"
<|emo_anger|> A lot of people seem really ticked off at the idea of an honourary doctorate.
"<|emo_fear|> Sounds like another data point for ""fear homo Sapiens"", haha. "
"<|emo_sad|> Nursing school is wrong on that. Still, sickle cell is really, legitimately painful. Give the Dilaudid."
<|emo_sad|> I'm crying.
<|emo_anger|> When you insult someone you might want to start by insulting them to where they can understand what you're trying to say...who givES A fuck .
<|emo_anger|> He'd hate me. My standards are even higher.
<|emo_sad|> I understand. Just know that I'm here. I've been through hell and back. I am happy to listen to anything.
"<|emo_sad|> [NAME] just has the runs. Don't worry, [NAME] is lacing up to replace him"
<|emo_fear|> There is something terrifying about petite crazy girls. LOL. The scariest girl in my middle school probably weighed 90 lbs. Everyone was scared of her.
<|emo_joy|> I’m glad people are calling your lying ass out about CF.
"<|emo_sad|> I want this back ""I want us back"" I missed the part where that's my problem"
"<|emo_anger|> Oh look, it's wr2! *proceeds to get fucked*"
"<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit, your therapist just (inadvertently) explained SO MUCH in my life, internet stranger."
<|emo_fear|> That was worse than a movie jump scare. I don't know why but giant squid feel more fearsome than sharks.
<|emo_disgust|> o7 o7 o7 o7 I couldn't donate sadly
<|emo_surprise|> I’m actually suprised they all didn’t follow him and now they all have to repeat junior year.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is a bitch
<|emo_joy|> You just made me remember [NAME] is gone and that made me happy. Thank you stranger.
"<|emo_sad|> I think the saddest thing here is that he thinks ""by-my-self"" is how to write that."
<|emo_disgust|> What a waste of packaging.
"<|emo_fear|> Welcome to the future, kid. Unfortunately your mom isn't coming."
"<|emo_anger|> Have you had no withdrawal symptoms? Did you quit cold turkey? I want to go off abilify, it sucks."
<|emo_anger|> are u ugly?
<|emo_sad|> I love rock music but I enjoy draft punk too.....*feels bad man*
"<|emo_anger|> I’ll give it a shot. Thanks for the alert. If this sub consistently hates it, it can’t be that bad."
<|emo_surprise|> I'm just glad I've never heard of this game before otherwise this news would be disappointing.

<|emo_sad|> I am so sorry to hear about your wife’s tragic injury.
<|emo_surprise|> That's just... Wow. I would've called CPS on her.
<|emo_sad|> The girl on the right got glass stuck in her leg poor girl
"<|emo_fear|> God, [NAME] looks rough. "
"<|emo_sad|> It was pretty heart breaking, then the council came out and said they weren't going to collect them. Made a lot of people mad. "
<|emo_fear|> Arizona in the summer is fine. Arizona in the winter when all the blue hair snowbirds come is absolutely horrifying.
<|emo_surprise|> If I got killed by someone while they're stunned I'd uninstall my game.
<|emo_sad|> She immediately regretted it when you reacted like an excited 3rd grader
<|emo_fear|> Screaming into a pillow afterwards
"<|emo_sad|> I'll pass the ""I'm not crying you're crying!"" part. Yeah I'm crying. "
"<|emo_disgust|> She likes sending nudes? I mean, just go with the flow and see what happens. "
<|emo_disgust|> This sounds like the kind of comment my weird uncle would leave on my Facebook post.
<|emo_disgust|> That’s always my worst fear when the idea of leaving during January comes up. I wish you the best of luck in unthawing them!
<|emo_surprise|> Absolutely amazing how people think this is anonymous.
"<|emo_disgust|> You're really on a shit-posting streak lately. Something happen in your life that you need to talk about, bud?"
"<|emo_sad|> You wont be sorry, look me up."
<|emo_anger|> > it will not make her look like an idiot It would be hard to make her look any more like an idiot than she already does.
<|emo_anger|> You credit yourself with acheivment you do not deserve. Not a first and defenitely wont be the last time.
<|emo_joy|> That IS a fun fact
"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, the cropping on this shitpost is as bad as it gets."
<|emo_disgust|> But but r/49ers said it was just bad luck!
<|emo_disgust|> Officially worse than Telkom. Well done vuma
<|emo_joy|> Ooh you made them?! Awesome!! I hope you enjoyed them. 5 cheeses sounds like a great decision.
"<|emo_disgust|> This sounds like revenge, not karma."
<|emo_anger|> > Probably because the guy gets violent because of his ~~ego~~ **fragile sexuality** FTFY
"<|emo_joy|> Going through a divorce right now. Her saying ""I love you and maybe we should go to counseling"" would make me more than happy."
<|emo_sad|> Sorry man [NAME] doesnt care about hard working [NAME]. Sad
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] has a fun instagram
<|emo_anger|> ...says the opioid addicted narcissist with multiple untreated physical and psychological ailments and is completely unable to work with anyone but his own clone.
<|emo_joy|> He's the best [NAME].
"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah that’s a bit odd, wouldn’t be surprised to see that change come gametime unless [NAME] is shook or something."
<|emo_sad|> time to stop concerning yourself with brexiteers and start worrying about what went so wrong in the EU before more countries decide to depart
"<|emo_anger|> That's a little girl, not a sandwich."
<|emo_fear|> Now I'm worried that cat will get salmonella :(
<|emo_fear|> Well this is terrifying.
<|emo_fear|> Only children are scared to take trains by themselves ...oh wait.
"<|emo_sad|> Sadly, he seems immune to bans. He also dodges them with alts like [NAME]"
<|emo_joy|> It's actually pretty condescending to tell people what words they're allowed to use to describe themselves.
<|emo_anger|> I didn’t know [NAME] disliked Pittsburgh so much
<|emo_anger|> Damned asshole trouble maker!! Someone has mummy issues. 👀
"<|emo_fear|> If we flip it, it’ll be too expensive for you to illegally emigrate there and retire, grandma."
<|emo_disgust|> That may be true. I was just pointing out that the logic of an appeal to nature is fallacious
<|emo_anger|> They typically go bad before use. I can buy a plastic banana!
"<|emo_disgust|> Have you ever, you know, tried not reading something that pisses you off? Just downvote and move on."
"<|emo_joy|> I may have awful taste, i would want this cake"
"<|emo_disgust|> I've been here too long. My first response was: ""I imagined worse."""
"<|emo_joy|> Yeah, all of their SB's have been really entertaining. Nothing worse than an SB like the Seahawks-Broncos from 5 years ago."
<|emo_anger|> WHY THE FUCK IS BAYLESS ISOING
"<|emo_anger|> ""She'll ruin your life either way."""
"<|emo_sad|> Once it became clear I was too old to have a family, yeah, it felt too old to bother with it."
"<|emo_joy|> Sorry, no punch line today. You guessed correctly on half an apple tho. Cheers"
<|emo_anger|> Fuck her... don’t live to make your parents happy
<|emo_joy|> That sounds wonderful.
"<|emo_anger|> If we're bullies, what does that make police who actually arrest people for rape and pedophilia? The final boss?"
"<|emo_disgust|> Good. It's weird that Polish gun culture is nearly non-existent, given their history as a country. Hopefully this is a step toward fixing that."
"<|emo_fear|> I know I should be worried, but I am not, which makes me very worried. "
"<|emo_joy|> Yes, I should be- GOOD LORD, WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THERE?"
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] seemed pretty pissed at himself for last game and kept saying at the end watching the film inspired him to go hit the gym
<|emo_anger|> WHAT THE HELL!
<|emo_anger|> The worst is when those moments pop up randomly. Especially when you’re feeling happy and then a mistake you did back in 2005 comes creeping up.
"<|emo_fear|> I believe that show scared straight was actually a massive failure, it got viewers but concept of it never resulted in the kids actually being 'scared straight'."
<|emo_joy|> glad to see paleho's doing well
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is a fucking retard whenever he tries to pass forward
<|emo_surprise|> did not know she speaks fluent Ukrainian.
"<|emo_anger|> Haven't noticed this comment before but, fcking [NAME], [NAME] really has become a household name hasn't she...?"
"<|emo_anger|> I disagree with you, therefore you must be an idiot. K."
<|emo_sad|> Ouch!!!!! That hurt me just watching.
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah Q was bad card I was just bloating the pot. I definitely feel this is one of the worst hands I’ve played.
"<|emo_surprise|> watching [NAME] attempt hook shots gives me a panic attack, even when he makes them (which is rare)"
<|emo_sad|> when my egg cracked I went through like every teen girl phase in the space of 2 months lol
<|emo_sad|> Such a sad way to think of life all because these people believe there's something greater than this.
"<|emo_disgust|> It doesn't bother me for some reason, I'm just lactose intolerant."
<|emo_disgust|> I hate text speak . Do you really want to dumb down your argument more than you need to?
<|emo_disgust|> I eat crayons I shit crayons
"<|emo_disgust|> Lmao ""guys I was *coerced* into sending her a picture of my junk"". That just sounds dumb as hell "
<|emo_sad|> Tried to ride the Overwatch train and crashed miserably.
<|emo_disgust|> Another trendy communist that doesn't know what communism is.
"<|emo_sad|> Thank you for your feedback, I was just trying to tell you my reasoning behind it sorry if I came off as angry."
<|emo_disgust|> In my day I had to wait 20 minutes for the internet to load a single porn pic. But man I miss that dial up sound
<|emo_surprise|> Ah! I couldn’t remember his name!
<|emo_disgust|> Lol you're an idiot.
"<|emo_joy|> Safeco had these chocolate covered ""fruit kabobs"" that were damn good. "
<|emo_anger|> Rightfully so. I had it as a child and it was the worst experience in my life. I'm also vulnerable for shingles now. Yaaay.
<|emo_anger|> When I was her age I had 3 jobs... oh you have like 18... get off my lawn!
"<|emo_joy|> This is most excellent news! Also, glad to know he went on to work somewhere like Google."
<|emo_anger|> Of course it was a huge hit for him. I hate people
<|emo_surprise|> Oh really? I didn’t know someone else posted it haha Edit: just looked and someone posted it right after me
<|emo_anger|> Dude nsfw this damn
<|emo_surprise|> lmao I didn't realize that error.
"<|emo_disgust|> 2 is washed out, 6 and 10 are too dark. Also imgur showed me a bald naked chimpanzee right after your last picture and I nearly choked. "
"<|emo_disgust|> Such a shame. Her butt was pert, cute and perfect in her Vogue days. Yes, I am showing my age."
<|emo_sad|> Could also be an overwhelming guilt in the heat of the moment. Probably hard to stay rational when you realize you've killed your own friend on accident.
<|emo_anger|> Get off my property
<|emo_surprise|> This was insane. I knew [NAME] was legit when he swung at a pitch while being intentionally walked and almost hit it out.
<|emo_joy|> This is giving me so much life.
<|emo_joy|> Happy cake day friend
<|emo_anger|> Fuuuuck. I am so angry that this can even happen.
<|emo_disgust|> Danm you can hear that little bastard squeaking.

<|emo_fear|> All of season 6 is terrible
<|emo_sad|> Sad ni🎈🎈a hours
<|emo_anger|> Too bad I do/
<|emo_disgust|> I fail to see how a current moderator isn't capable. Perhaps they never delegated the task is all.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I didn't know this policy was in place in the 70s!
<|emo_joy|> Phoenix sunrises and sunsets have been nice the past week with all the clouds and rain - beautiful shot!
<|emo_fear|> This sounds like borderline mental health issues. Scary.
"<|emo_disgust|> No. Why? Weird question. Unfortunately, the CCP would be suppressing me if I were. Better than ending up in a Xinjiang concentration camp though. "
<|emo_sad|> It’s sad that some parents can’t accept some simple mistakes.
"<|emo_joy|> No kids, I have a broken oven. When my marriage fell apart that was a blessing."
<|emo_fear|> Oh [NAME] that's terrible. I hope things are better for you now.
<|emo_anger|> Are you daft ... ? That is and always has been the proposal. [NAME] don't listen and don't care though. Fucking dumbass.
<|emo_disgust|> Her husband is disgusting. I can’t even look at the cute baby when his face is in the shot.
<|emo_anger|> That’s rude af. Slay him with your words. Give him every insult in the book then say bye bye
<|emo_anger|> That sucks. I had to deal with something similar. Sorry you go through this.

<|emo_sad|> That scene made me think of Arizona a little bit tbh. I think I'm missing [NAME]*

<|emo_anger|> Not enough. I'd pay $100 to not be ugly in a heartbeat
<|emo_sad|> I started out by being sick.. and the realization that no one is going to help me... Not even my family not friends.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh you mean [NAME]?
<|emo_anger|> You Libs. alhave you heads so far up you arses it isn't even funny.
<|emo_disgust|> Ehhh he got played so hard on the [NAME] vs [NAME] situation in 2017. Lost credibility after that for me
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] was only president for four years dumbass and [NAME] served 81-89 dumbass this whole thing is made up and she’s a dumbass
<|emo_anger|> Fuuuuck. I feel this. In my core.
<|emo_sad|> Give it time. Pain like that needs to heal just like open wounds. I really hope that you will eventually start to feel better.
<|emo_sad|> Why so hateful. I feel sorry for you.
"<|emo_joy|> Haven't played anything else as long as it's been up, no matter if duos or squads"
<|emo_joy|> Woah nice. Did you enjoy it or was it a completionist pain? I wish I could get into [NAME] but I just dont find the fun.
"<|emo_joy|> So, [NAME] was also paying to allow her to eat healthier. Let’s look at the bright side! "
"<|emo_surprise|> #YOU'RE RIGHT, PEOPLE BEING OUTRAGED BY THE ACTIONS OF A CRIMINAL IS HYSTERICAL!"
<|emo_sad|> then its lost man. So sad!...its terrible
<|emo_disgust|> One wonders just how awful [NAME] and [NAME] have to be before people will believe it.

<|emo_joy|> Oh right cos things now are sooooo amazing.
<|emo_disgust|> Seems like every season she is less hot. Too bad
<|emo_fear|> I'm moving to the UK in 2 weeks. This terrifies me.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] I almost forgot about the hot dr pepper in a glass glass made of glass
<|emo_surprise|> Omg saucepan what a daring and unconventional look!!!11
<|emo_joy|> The thing to understand about [NAME] is that he's a complete moron.
"<|emo_anger|> I don't necessarily hate them, but then again, I dislike it when people breed while knowing how harsh life is."
<|emo_disgust|> This used to be a lot more common when I was younger. So weird.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] what happened?? A water main break up there😂
<|emo_sad|> Well they called and said there was a pricing discrepancy and they could not honor it. 😭 sad day.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wait, you don't love reading people's blog posts on Reddit?"
<|emo_disgust|> Bruh by isn’t [NAME]
<|emo_anger|> Wow dude get a life and stop digging through my comments trying to pick a fight like a belligerent moron.

<|emo_disgust|> Huh. Weird.
<|emo_surprise|> wow octane is pure garbage lmao
<|emo_anger|> Why would you mention [NAME]? Lol
"<|emo_disgust|> They’re both good towns. Personally, I prefer Westfield. It has a better downtown, better schools, and the traffic is less awful. "
"<|emo_sad|> I'm not crying, you're crying"
<|emo_joy|> yes!! i was like oh my god. oh my [NAME]. it’s gone. the weight’s GONE. i’m FREE!
<|emo_joy|> We're in it... and now [NAME] is going to the bench? Gotta good feeling!
"<|emo_anger|> And the new sword is kinda shitty, and not even a complete sword at that price. Also, the sword is really bad for the environment."
<|emo_sad|> I have the exact same issue and also had my ears checked recently but there is no issue with my hearing
<|emo_joy|> That was honestly my first thought I’m so glad someone else went there too
<|emo_anger|> I hope there is a special place in Hell for these people.
<|emo_surprise|> With punctuation like that I'm surprised you're not from Jordanhill
<|emo_joy|> And I for one welcome our new meme overlords.
<|emo_anger|> Lucky you got a sane dad. Get ready for a world of crazy... just don't get sucked into her toxic world. Good luck.
"<|emo_anger|> BOUNDARIES. have some boundaries. say no. don't go. this is frustrating to read, honestly. don't do things that you hate doing."
<|emo_anger|> Do you fucken mind
"<|emo_fear|> Kind of wish they recorded a video of the shard of glass moving through the heart, we would all pee a little in our pants."
<|emo_joy|> So this is what edging feels like
"<|emo_joy|> Very true thank you for the insight, this does help as I need to remind myself this is a new relationship and part of our reconciliation."

<|emo_disgust|> Worst president ever.
<|emo_anger|> I'm just saying you are demanding things of us while being nasty yourself.
"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, that's the only war we lost. "
"<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry to hear, come see me when you die."
"<|emo_disgust|> I want to say I'm shocked. I'm not. Disgusted, but not shocked."
"<|emo_joy|> I enjoy it as well, there's dozens of us!"
"<|emo_disgust|> There's zero defending [NAME], he's worse than [NAME]"

<|emo_disgust|> Scat will NEVER be my thing. Or vomit.

<|emo_anger|> I spent the entire time trying not to yell at the TV. [NAME] and [NAME] can fuck right off.
<|emo_sad|> The comments on this thread are what I expected and that makes me sad.
<|emo_disgust|> I’m sorry friend. I actually used to be pretty good with this but I’m constantly getting worse.
<|emo_joy|> [Facebook laugh react]
<|emo_surprise|> OMG I totally forgot about that episode. What a nightmare
"<|emo_disgust|> You are the type of fellow that puts mommy in the cheap home and cashes her cheques, loyalty of a snake."
<|emo_surprise|> That's awesome. I would never have expected the Prius community to be so involved.
<|emo_joy|> You can see his tooth bouncing off the pavement on the right after he falls. Brings a tear of joy to my eye 😅

<|emo_sad|> Yikes - I'm so sorry things fell apart for you and imposing a sudden hierarchy on you like that was completely crappy on their part.

<|emo_surprise|> So many insecure balding guys itt.
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] sure are afraid of brown women.

<|emo_surprise|> >This weird exploding ice [NAME] I haven't seen before? Wow. I... that's some ick right there.

"<|emo_sad|> I'm with you, pulju has been looking dangerous lately"
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is a moron. Why take the ball away from your best player and give arguably the best RB in the nation the chance to run it out.
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] frenzy it's a joke
<|emo_anger|> they already ruined their own lives by having an affair. the other spouse knowing is just a consequence of their selfish actions.
<|emo_surprise|> We had a long debate about how old Jackie bird is and as per every year were surprised by the result. Was pish
"<|emo_joy|> This post made me howl in laughter in the handicapped bathroom, thank you /u/coffeewhore17"
<|emo_joy|> Who is this Wild team? Where have they been?
<|emo_surprise|> Is this because of the sudden spate of comments feeling shocked that we don't respect proud right leaners or have you always had these mails?
<|emo_disgust|> Eww that would mean creating a facebook account.
<|emo_sad|> So many [NAME] killed in Hoi An. [NAME] damn do I love that exchange rate.

"<|emo_disgust|> Sorry if I was insulting, I just took your post as some commie type smugly trolling how stupid [NAME] is "
<|emo_joy|> Gonna be at the game! Let's get this win boys!
<|emo_fear|> Because prostitutes clearly can't be raped or kidnapped. It's so horrifying that our society still believes this.
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] what a piece of shit! How could you do that to an animal?!
<|emo_fear|> Imagining ten generations alive at the same time *is* a terrifying concept.
"<|emo_disgust|> Not gonna lie, kinda looks like a unicorn sneezed on waffles"
<|emo_anger|> Seems like you're another guy who hates legion ;D
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder can they basejump to the bottom.

<|emo_joy|> That face in 0:18. That's the face of happiness
<|emo_disgust|> After reading a lot of replies you should bee ashamed of yourself. This thread is a hive of bad puns and references.
"<|emo_anger|> Damnit, it was *Flavor-Aid*, not Kool-Aid."
<|emo_fear|> I did those things in real life and I've never had a single nightmare. Face your fears.
<|emo_joy|> This story puts me in the mood for a jolly rancher

<|emo_joy|> Ha ha ha. That was a good one
"<|emo_sad|> Holy bait-and-switch, [NAME]. I’m so sorry, that has to be incredibly stressful to have to be around and deal with."
<|emo_surprise|> So shocking a couple in their 20s in counseling isn’t going to work out.
"<|emo_surprise|> Woah, cool!"
<|emo_disgust|> Because [NAME] was playing awful in the first two sets. Absolutely terrible.
<|emo_disgust|> I'm [RELIGION] and I'm disgusting lol

<|emo_anger|> Watching [NAME] flip his head back every poke of contact is possibly the most frustrating thing to watch
<|emo_joy|> Thanks so much for this pic! It’s even funnier the third time in ten minutes it’s posted here.
<|emo_fear|> The weirdest part is the underwear. My mom wouldn’t even let me and my sister share underwear. Something something hygiene.
<|emo_disgust|> hmm... it didnt work for me when i posted it but now it does... weird af
<|emo_anger|> That one pesky drop of water was in it for the long haul.

<|emo_sad|> I will take it a as serious question. Sorry. I am in Europe
<|emo_sad|> We're so bad x4
"<|emo_anger|> The FDA has plenty to criticize. But like here, it's usually criticized horribly off base. It needs to grow some balls and actually enforce things. "
<|emo_joy|> I know a couple of people who are. It's amazing to watch.

<|emo_joy|> Seriously. I had 2 jobs and was in college. I sleep more now!
"<|emo_fear|> Aaaand I'm still here. I don't have a alt account but whoever you reported I""m sure is alive and well. You're terrible."
<|emo_joy|> This is very uplifting! Had very similar experiences with my wife's family. Thank you for sharing!
<|emo_sad|> We may destroy the rest of the world in the process.
"<|emo_joy|> This makes me so happy, having a step parent can be a sensitive thing but you are definitely a good example of what to do, congrats!"
"<|emo_disgust|> This is almost irritating. Like, take a breath, shithead..,"
<|emo_sad|> I'm so sorry. You can do this. Just remember YOU are a person who is worthy of love and respect.
<|emo_fear|> My balls shrunk up looking at that

"<|emo_fear|> *Dread it, run from it* *[NAME] still arrives*"
<|emo_anger|> Looks like you clipped my own games. It’s bad lately.
"<|emo_fear|> but that’s exactly my point lol you get better at those things, the scary factor affecting skill learning becomes smaller and smaller"
<|emo_sad|> Sorry. I read that as newly white and it cracked me up.
<|emo_anger|> And what a fuckton of karma it was. It’s fake stories like this that really prove that communism is the far superior economic system.
"<|emo_joy|> The possibilities are fascinating. In other times, I'd be enjoying watching the lawyers argue...!"
<|emo_surprise|> Wow! Now that's some propaganda we could use more of!
"<|emo_anger|> Excuse me, I hate to bother you but could you please inform me what you find so aggravating about sea Lions?"

"<|emo_fear|> Okay, fair enough, though the vid worried me about the level of grinding in the game"
"<|emo_anger|> Sure, let's kill a guy with a buck on his horse because that's how it was in the old west. Smh"
"<|emo_joy|> Finally, one win for the war on drugs!"
<|emo_joy|> my parents got engaged in the courtyard of [NAME] back in the 70s
"<|emo_anger|> Fuck me, that is good. "

"<|emo_anger|> Damn, I didn’t see any monkeys when I was there! What a ripoff."
"<|emo_joy|> Goodness, that shot of McDonald's is **super** old. It looks like a picture from the 90s/early 2000s."

<|emo_anger|> Pure asshole.
<|emo_surprise|> Can’t believe they actually got married. What a joke
"<|emo_surprise|> So funny, I just watched this one today and was struck by [NAME] in the height of his coked out glory. He is absolutely so gross. "
"<|emo_anger|> I don’t care what anyone says. Party pizzas are the best frozen pizza you can get. Still mad about them being square now, though."
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] yer fucked.
<|emo_anger|> Man this sucks. Hope you’re enjoying life in a big house with lambs!
<|emo_disgust|> You look like 1 of those ISIS fighters got shot in the head
"<|emo_sad|> Everyone seems to forget how much he sucked as a quarterback, there’s a reason he was un drafted"
"<|emo_anger|> I can see how you feel , THIS DID NOT TEACH A CHILD TO RESPECT ANIMALS and im ashamed and upset honeslty no horse deserved that."
<|emo_fear|> This must have been totally horrifying for you. I'm glad to hear you found peace in the second birth.
<|emo_sad|> Goodbye cruel world.
"<|emo_sad|> That is so sad, just goes to show we have a lot more to learn about the other beings we share this rock with : /"
<|emo_disgust|> Yes absolutely extreme levels of anxiety reaching the sheer terror phase tbh. People have no idea what I go through
"<|emo_anger|> They hated [NAME] since the beginning of [RELIGION], they treated them like animals"
<|emo_surprise|> i cant believe they went after lady [NAME] who has been compared to [NAME]
<|emo_surprise|> I didn't think it was that bad tbh
"<|emo_anger|> I have chosen not to kill people that I was going to slaughter just because they said ""Hey! How are you?"""
"<|emo_disgust|> Comments like these are the biggest reason I get so pissed off about fucking centrists crying about the ""both sides"" argument. "
<|emo_anger|> ONLY FUCKING MERRILL WOULD MISS THAT
<|emo_disgust|> Not gonna lie I’m against offensive chants don’t @ me. I think they are unnecessary and a detriment to the O calling a play
<|emo_joy|> I enjoy living the lie. I do it everyday
<|emo_joy|> good news is his fall was cushioned by [NAME] soft hairy body
<|emo_disgust|> He has been horrible in pull up situations but not horrible with catch and shoot this season.
"<|emo_joy|> hey, that's me. Glad i'm done with the class, so much work"
<|emo_anger|> I got an unsolicited text from wal-mart earlier today and I almost went into orbit. Spam texts are completely unacceptable.
"<|emo_joy|> Why not, I mean [NAME] is a child who likes to play with puppets. "
<|emo_surprise|> Tell them personally how you feel and that you want things to change for better
<|emo_fear|> Yeah if you fall into a tree hole there’s almost no chance of getting yourself out.
<|emo_surprise|> Wait one of the posters responding is using makeup from ten years ago.
<|emo_surprise|> Can’t believe we’re letting [NAME] go. So much energy since he’s come on.
<|emo_joy|> Crush. Big crush. Still have it.
"<|emo_joy|> Aww man this sucks, but at least he’s going to Europe, so I’m happy for him! Goodbye [NAME]! "
"<|emo_sad|> Im sorry that I'm only able to give a single upvote for this wonderful, graphic, and accurate visualization."
<|emo_joy|> You seem fun
<|emo_anger|> It’s a substitute teacher. She should know to stay in her lane.
<|emo_disgust|> Worst dad ever!
<|emo_surprise|> I am [NAME] total lack of suprise
<|emo_surprise|> Wow. As much as I like pizza I would get sick of it if I were to eat it every single day.
<|emo_joy|> that is awesome! i've been looking into going to therapy myself. glad you were able to have a great experience.
<|emo_sad|> I'm glad you found your way. And even missing one day of effexor gets me sick so I feel for you
<|emo_surprise|> You let u/The-Ginger-cow make tasteless rape jokes.THIS is where you draw the line?
<|emo_sad|> But her cancer the second time was caused by the chemo! /s
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] type awkwardness that some thots go nuts for.
<|emo_surprise|> What a crybaby. Don’t drink and drive.
"<|emo_surprise|> As someone who could totally eat three donuts in a row if I let myself, the amount of sugar this woman consumed still struck terror into my heart"
<|emo_anger|> You have to be rich to use health insurance; the copays are brutal.
<|emo_sad|> I feel bad for laughing at this now that the creator of Spongebob passed away a month ago.
<|emo_sad|> Bad news dude. You're almost 100 years past that.
"<|emo_disgust|> SHE. IS. THE. FUCKING. WORST. P.S. You’re not fat, you just need a stylist. 🙄"
<|emo_sad|> This is the scariest thing I think I’ve ever read on here. That is just so horrible.
<|emo_surprise|> That one guy barley touched the car and it stoped
<|emo_fear|> >[NAME] One of the most horrifying stories I've ever heard of: the mom should be in psychiatric care and the doctor thrown in jail IMO.
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] still got a little pop tho for calling for the match. Makes me smile that the crowd still loves her.
"<|emo_fear|> Well I'm scared as shit let's hope for the best, benz should be back(?)"
<|emo_joy|> And sing the beat !
"<|emo_anger|> Abso-goddamn-lutely. It’s the only thing I can think of that can make otherwise rational people defend rape, murder, genocide and slavery. "
<|emo_disgust|> It means less when you hear words come out of her foul mouth. Almost incomprehensible.
<|emo_fear|> I thought about it before. But I'm afraid I might get in trouble.
"<|emo_joy|> I rate [NAME] highly, so this is good news."
<|emo_anger|> Horribly fake. People on that thread are stupid and gullible.
<|emo_disgust|> >ctrl + F > fuck your mother I am not disappointed.
<|emo_surprise|> Happy cake day!!!
"<|emo_joy|> This was not only true, but pleasing to watch."
"<|emo_surprise|> ""Hey look at this reciept! Oops I totally didn't mean to show off my great body."" I see what you did there ;)"
<|emo_anger|> Almost downvoted you just because that made me so angry.

<|emo_fear|> Kinda but it’s still a terrible meme
"<|emo_fear|> Ah sorry [NAME], I was going to join. But your desperate posts scared me away!"
<|emo_surprise|> It is amazing how social media is allowing maniacs to congregate. Social media is very bad for us.
<|emo_joy|> That would be me lol; glad it made you laugh
<|emo_anger|> You admit to discrimination based on your personal criteria. Say no more.
<|emo_sad|> I want to end it all.
<|emo_anger|> That and useful idiots.
"<|emo_anger|> I'm not crying, you're crying"
"<|emo_fear|> It's crazy, the first day with icy, snowy roads it's scary but within a few days, grip and visibility sound like fantasy"
"<|emo_sad|> Didn’t know if you knew, so I was just trying to give context to your statement. Sorry. "
"<|emo_surprise|> When he said, ""IT'S CALLED RESPECT"" and gritted through his teeth-- wow, he is just waiting to let his hands fly."
<|emo_joy|> I’ve only been there once but really enjoyed it!! But I think it’s missing a pool table ;)
<|emo_anger|> We got heated toilet seats here in Japan. Big smiles.
<|emo_sad|> And yet you're still not making me regret being a TV hodad when that was on and so missing it.
<|emo_anger|> Today on someone flamed me in chat
<|emo_surprise|> OMG the ones they sometimes sell that are just one giant piece. LOVE
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, did you not know [NAME] is the highest graded overall passrusher in this class? At any position!"
"<|emo_sad|> I’m broke, dealing with my own mental illness, and immediately concerned with just keeping the peace."
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah, because it’s soooo arduous to look at someone’s profile for five seconds. "
<|emo_joy|> I like you
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is soft as hell boi got bullied in Minnesota
<|emo_surprise|> Omg a drop pass worked. 👀
"<|emo_disgust|> If I hear ""not sorry, [NAME]"" one more time, I'm going to start disliking [NAME]"

<|emo_disgust|> Yes. I hate everything that has to do with my depression.
<|emo_fear|> Omg!!! just saw an interview of her! Wow this [NAME] is a horrible mother!!! Oh my Gooood! 😱
<|emo_joy|> Oh well... I'll like both of you.

<|emo_disgust|> It could have been worse! All the chairs and table are still upright.
"<|emo_joy|> ~~macri gato~~ Also, nice to see Buthan there"
<|emo_sad|> Yeah because streaming services don’t pay their artists well enough
<|emo_anger|> U.S. are going to fuck this [NAME] guy so hard...he's going to need help to remove all the stars from his rectum
<|emo_surprise|> Yow thats gnarly.
"<|emo_joy|> Great. So increase prices 20% overall, give the waiters the extra money. I'm happy with that. 20% is a great tip."
<|emo_anger|> I hate y'all too
<|emo_joy|> I like this a lot

<|emo_anger|> Yeah it sort of sucks now.
<|emo_anger|> Increase in robberies on pot shops. I really hope not though.
<|emo_joy|> The rams seem pretty happy with [NAME].
<|emo_disgust|> I kinda like the swirlies in the hair. But then I saw that her eyebrow is actually just the hair and hated it.
<|emo_anger|> That 0.75 is not for the same job. It's looking at the totality of female salary vs male salary.
<|emo_fear|> When I got to grow old yet... They'll either remember how much damage it all is just ridiculously macabre.
"<|emo_fear|> For a [NAME] [NAME], PKK are oppressive socialists whose ideas belongs to previous century and are destructive and murderous."
<|emo_joy|> Imagine bragging about a “your mum” joke
<|emo_sad|> Now I’m crying before work thanks a lot 😭
<|emo_joy|> The app trio is the only thing worthwhile there. Won ton tacos +boneless wings + spinach dip and I'm a happy camper.
<|emo_joy|> I was inspired by your post to grab a thing of Greek yogurt with pineapple I've got in the fridge. Hell yeah.
"<|emo_anger|> Not sure, I'm not good at expressing my feelings, and sometimes I get angry and say things that very hurtful"
<|emo_sad|> It’s a rough time I hope your Ex wife gets better.
<|emo_anger|> “Attack on masculinity” I’m dying over here you fragile motherfucker.
"<|emo_fear|> Skeptical approach, always lol"
<|emo_anger|> Oh [NAME] you idiot
<|emo_sad|> I miss [NAME]
<|emo_joy|> He happily accepts the hugs. He hugs me now and again. He also has no problem accepting hugs from his mum.
"<|emo_sad|> INFP. I’m a very selfless person, which helped me find friends, but not a love interest or a partner"
<|emo_sad|> Because love is a lie and there is no happiness in the world
<|emo_disgust|> What a douche. Yeah I try to order within my country to keep away from customs
<|emo_sad|> The sad thing is that most of them are gone the next election anyway.
<|emo_sad|> Actually nothing. The only thing is it's hard to brush while sitting down. I have to stand up.
<|emo_joy|> It makes it especially delicious when our one sub with ~100 active members gets accused of controlling the entire political debate on Reddit
<|emo_surprise|> I have no idea how we are down by ONLY 13. Its truly a miracle.
<|emo_sad|> It would be really bad for relations between the two cities if we took Memphis' NBA team.
<|emo_joy|> I enjoyed when they learned what New York City billionaires really think about guns.
<|emo_sad|> I feel that nobody cares and nothing will be different because this is a total non issue for vast majority of people.
<|emo_disgust|> His best season was a luck filled one. He'd be nothing more than what [NAME] and [NAME] already offer but with worse defense and a worse bat.
"<|emo_disgust|> No, he wasn't the entire problem, but his performance can't be excused by coaching alone. He's just not very good."
<|emo_anger|> How dare they not have the foresight to realize he'll become a president we don't like decades later.
<|emo_joy|> But now we're stressed out.
"<|emo_fear|> Do you have any recommended places? A lot of the sites I’ve looked at want you to pay, kinda hard when your broke lol. "
<|emo_disgust|> That’s because it’s stupid and nobody wants it!
"<|emo_disgust|> As bad as this sub was in the 1st quarter, our announcers were just as awful."
"<|emo_anger|> Oh look another stupid comment, original but not unexpected."
<|emo_anger|> Shut up [NAME]
"<|emo_anger|> ""Feed the wars and fuck the poors"" is pretty much their policy."
<|emo_anger|> This is horrible
<|emo_surprise|> hey sweets...
"<|emo_sad|> This is going to end in absolute tears, the days of hoofball dominating the Championship are long gone, you actually need to play football to get anywhere."
"<|emo_anger|> YEAAAAHH!!!!YEAAAAHHH!!!!...oh, here ya go, doom-di-doom..."
"<|emo_joy|> Great questions. I don't have the answer, but I'm happy that were starting to discuss it."
"<|emo_anger|> This is very [serious], how dare you guys mock this [serious] science?!"
<|emo_joy|> Enjoy the void
<|emo_surprise|> Could you imagine? That would be so terrible for viewers. 😂
<|emo_joy|> Glad to hear it :) definitely more on the way!
<|emo_sad|> I'm so depressed
<|emo_disgust|> Whatever mental condition he has is far worse than autism.
<|emo_surprise|> okay I just checked and OMG IT's SO TRUE (mostly) I really am a [NAME] <3
"<|emo_disgust|> Come to Somerset, quite a few women are cricket crazy because everybody is cricket crazy here. It’s weird. "
<|emo_disgust|> They’re disgusting people inside and out
"<|emo_sad|> It's like [NAME] said. They get motivated by a bad loss, they win a game, get unmotivated, and lose badly again"
<|emo_anger|> You admit to discrimination based on your personal criteria. Say no more.
<|emo_anger|> You're a mean person.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, way to disregard history completely."
<|emo_disgust|> so obnoxious.
<|emo_joy|> The best music for the best voice....epic & timeless 🎶❣️
<|emo_disgust|> This is creepy af
<|emo_anger|> That was intentional as fuck. I don’t know how anyone could argue that after that insane contortionist layup over [NAME] last week.
<|emo_anger|> Because he's attractive. Hence [NAME] come out in droves to defend him despite the fact he's a horrid asshole.
<|emo_surprise|> I do not trust our defense at all. I do not believe you can increase the range of Andujar.
"<|emo_sad|> I'm gonna say break it off and expect them to date at some point. So prepare for that one. Sorry bud, good luck! "
"<|emo_surprise|> ""Muscles? You mean blood balloons?"""
<|emo_disgust|> Pam Beesly and Jim... What a waste.
<|emo_joy|> oh my good
<|emo_sad|> I heard the same thing after she had made false allegations and tried to hoover me back . Its so triggering now .
<|emo_anger|> Fire the ux designers and yes also our beloved [NAME]
"<|emo_anger|> “I don’t need no more sisters, I got enough last year” *cut to shocked mid drag faces in the werk room*"
<|emo_anger|> And DICE has told us fuck all about how they intend to fix it and when to expect the fix.
<|emo_surprise|> I would be creeped out.
<|emo_sad|> Hot take: [NAME] sucked after he went away to anger management and he suddenly changed into a moron who was completely incapable of doing anything even remotely correct.
<|emo_anger|> Its ok we all know you suck scrub.
<|emo_joy|> I'd be happy with a Goff win too. And you can't hate Brees. Rams vs. Chargers would be perfect. final score 72-70.
<|emo_sad|> You sound quite childish and unable to engage with any information that doesn’t conform to your narrative. Sad.
<|emo_surprise|> I’m glad I wasn’t the only person who wondered about [NAME].
<|emo_anger|> “Attack on masculinity” I’m dying over here you fragile motherfucker.
<|emo_surprise|> He was transgender or wanted to be as well. Super rare case in a few ways.
<|emo_surprise|> Are you joking? 538 has him hovering around -15 net approval. He won’t win unless Dems nominate someone like [NAME] again at this rate.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wait.....What? You do know that's not how it works, right?"
<|emo_anger|> She's a moron for running out in traffic. Deserved all she got.
<|emo_surprise|> best part was him tearing apart his Real shirt while walking out
"<|emo_fear|> Gonna warn you, that path is a lot more dangerous than you would think..."
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad the republican won cause I want the best high I have had 5 back surgeries and need another.
<|emo_anger|> What the frick. I ordered a x box card
<|emo_sad|> I'm painfully aware of that having bought a FreeSync monitor with my Nvidia graphics card.
<|emo_anger|> I never gave you approval?
<|emo_fear|> I need to hear more stories like this. I've only heard horror stories of the pain with the surgery as an adult.
<|emo_sad|> A sorry lot
<|emo_joy|> Damn Blake is on fire today
<|emo_sad|> Yep. Seriously painful to read
"<|emo_fear|> I like your version more, anyways. Better comedic relief from such a horribe tragedy."
<|emo_surprise|> Damn you were thirsty asf for thos first two😂
<|emo_sad|> that made me cry tears of sadness and joy at the same time.
<|emo_disgust|> This post is bad because the only good phone is the Palm Pre 3 running webOS
"<|emo_sad|> It's hard for me to switch between english and spanish in the same sentence, sorry I'll try to improve in the future"
"<|emo_fear|> “Guys watch out, the scary looking kid is coming down the hall”"
"<|emo_sad|> Sadly, I don't have insurance so unless I'm bleeding out I won't be getting medical help."
<|emo_joy|> Like I said please have a great day !
<|emo_joy|> Exactly! Someone think of the billionaires! Sometimes I pretend I’m one and it’s really fun :)
"<|emo_joy|> Wasn't getting anywhere to begin with, might as well have some toxic fun with it."
<|emo_sad|> Don't worry. You'll grow out of Pearl Jam.
<|emo_joy|> Less to keep track of
<|emo_anger|> Fuck off.
<|emo_joy|> Fuck me daddy
<|emo_anger|> Saw plenty. That is how to be a jerk to a cat. It will enforce bad behavior.
<|emo_sad|> Emo!!
"<|emo_sad|> Where the mask inside, too? Are air purifers not good enough for inside? Sorry for the dumb question... Just moved here this week."
<|emo_joy|> It was a screech of delight. I like this hire. Would let to get a good OC now.
<|emo_fear|> I'll try that but I'm thinking about going outside when it is unbearable to sleep. Also I'm scared of cold making me more sleepy.
<|emo_joy|> Lol naughty dog tattoo. Y’all done fuxked your reputation by letting your artist do this trash.
<|emo_joy|> Yay yayeeeee!
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] path made me hate everything associated with pirates
<|emo_joy|> Hope they don't pull another [NAME] on [NAME]. Good to hear [NAME] added muscle and is healthy. Hopefully he and [NAME] can play all 16 this season
"<|emo_sad|> And [NAME], would again like to apologize for any misunderstanding."
<|emo_sad|> But it's especially tough when its state-owned oil. A lot of Scandinavian countries had hiccups.
<|emo_surprise|> Is that Guildford? There always seems to be plenty of zombie-like pedestrians around town!
<|emo_surprise|> Happy Cakeday!
<|emo_anger|> So wtf can I do then ? All the killers I was good with I suck with now and ruin is cleansed way too damn fast anymore .
<|emo_sad|> Ay just like my life *whips whilst sobbing

"<|emo_fear|> I'm more than sure we [NAME] lovers feel the same way, her outfits are awful"
"<|emo_disgust|> No, she's standing in the water after she pees."
<|emo_fear|> Don't forget those ungodly concoctions with apple cider vinegar
<|emo_sad|> Thats awful and Im sorry for your friend. I whole heartedly agree. Its getting out of hand.
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME], let's celebrate together, y'all will be the king of New York. Praise Marks."
<|emo_joy|> so did that one guy outside of AT&T :)
"<|emo_fear|> Reminder that [NAME] incel army literally physically assaulted [NAME] fans when she spoke in East LA, including children."
"<|emo_sad|> yup today hit me extra hard since im unemployed. i feel like im not meant to work, or meant to do anything really!"
<|emo_joy|> It's interesting that you don't address anything but just come to troll
"<|emo_disgust|> Turns out you can polish a turd. The trouble is, it's still just shit."
<|emo_anger|> Crafty little bastards.
"<|emo_anger|> You can't be worse than [NAME], your hired!"
"<|emo_joy|> Gotta be honest here, these people are so crazy that I read this expecting the store to be a literal apple store that sells apples. "
"<|emo_joy|> Can you imagine if management was like ""Hey [NAME], we need you to fire the custodian. Thanks."""
"<|emo_fear|> First I was afraid, I was petrified..."
"<|emo_anger|> Yeah man, fuck the man. Can’t have people getting free stuff or have any creative marketing ideas."
<|emo_sad|> Someone who’s to sad and empty to care about toast... me I guess?
"<|emo_anger|> I've been looking forward to this But damn, I was hoping for some epic revenge story ;-; "
<|emo_sad|> I saw 25yr old with 3 kids and a house. How do u think I feel. I'm over 30 and still single.
"<|emo_anger|> yes, i fucking hate that."
<|emo_sad|> Sorry for your loss; this story is heartwarming.
"<|emo_surprise|> Ok. Progress. Not only I presented more facts, I also asked some questions. Still unanswered, sadly. "
"<|emo_surprise|> A surprise, but a welcome one"
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] with that birthday gift
<|emo_joy|> Yep first to go crying to the government but happy to bully single mums on the benefit
<|emo_sad|> I high key thought this same thing then it was sad boy hours when I broke things up
<|emo_sad|> Nooooooooo I was a student staff member at the WCC and this makes me so sad and angryyyyy
<|emo_fear|> No. Can’t get off to my own sex.
"<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst meme format in the history of meme formats, maybe ever"
<|emo_anger|> Rec and Red just need to die as teams. Fucking joke of a performance here considering how much funding they are both getting.
<|emo_sad|> I guess her Bad breath turned him off
"<|emo_surprise|> Seems fun, wonder how she would have ended up if the ca er was not there"
"<|emo_joy|> But if you made that joke about other groups, you would be strongly condemned."
"<|emo_disgust|> Cat call girls on thebstreet, but get pissed when its done to his sister."
<|emo_sad|> Rip I guess.... Hope op does that Also happy cake day!
<|emo_sad|> I feel shot in the heart.
<|emo_anger|> You already used that one my abusive buddy.
<|emo_anger|> Some people have thin skin and are unequipped with dealing with backlash.
"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, the content is bad enough but the financing is on a whole other level of sketchy. "
<|emo_disgust|> Damn... that’s another thing I didn’t even think about it. Probably the biggest reason why people shouldn’t steal food
<|emo_joy|> Good. I'm glad that you are getting help.
<|emo_disgust|> These memes are either on a 9gag level or r/funny levels of comedy. And I can't tell which is worse.
<|emo_fear|> EWWW yes. This makes me shudder. All wet and gross.
<|emo_disgust|> This is pretty bad advice. Do not use dreams own encryption. And do not use things such as igolder
<|emo_sad|> The sad part about this is that these memes are more Gen Z if anything...
<|emo_anger|> It makes me super fucking nervous edit: was able to buy temple at +1 fuck it lets ride
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] is not a guy I root against. Just hope we have a good enjoyable game
"<|emo_anger|> Yeah I know what you meant. Fuck the police, most of them are vile pieces of shit, they deserve every kick in the back they get."
<|emo_anger|> Did you just call me a *bitch*?? You will NOT disrespect me like this TODAY!
<|emo_disgust|> Hey and there are people who drink their urine too. Maybe try that next.
<|emo_anger|> I flew off the handle and that's my bad.
"<|emo_surprise|> I'm poly and jn the Raleigh area too, moved here for my wife's job, surprised to find so many people mention it haha. "
"<|emo_sad|> Im color blind, i usually see blue as purple and red as green soo..."
"<|emo_anger|> Shut up, [NAME]. "
<|emo_surprise|> What a nice [NAME] sentiment!
<|emo_anger|> You're going NOWHERE! Edit: [NAME]
<|emo_joy|> El oh el that was fucking funny
"<|emo_surprise|> Okay, that was actually shocking."
<|emo_surprise|> This is a throwback game. So many plays in the low post
"<|emo_joy|> Yep, still fun to theorise though!"
<|emo_joy|> 1 is spot on. Anxiety completely disappears. I like when that happens. One less issue
"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, I thought the same"
<|emo_anger|> >So that was a **fucking** lie. FTFY.
<|emo_disgust|> Huh? Mutts are usually healthier than pure-breds. It's the pure-bred dogs that have weird genetic issues.
<|emo_disgust|> Play stupid games and win stupid prizes dude.
<|emo_joy|> I'm a guy and it's the same for me! I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels this way. 😊
<|emo_surprise|> I can never refold the paper properly so kudos just for that!
"<|emo_anger|> I'd hate to see the [NAME] be reduced to a drunk junker. You know, like REYS parents are. "
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME], is this the new transphobia specific ""Post Hog""? Because it really should be."
<|emo_joy|> This made me smile. I watched it on YouTube.
<|emo_sad|> ooh man I miss OutKast. brings me back to my childhood
<|emo_surprise|> No way! First I’m hearing about this
"<|emo_joy|> CONGRATS! Happy for both your personal health journey and being in a healthy place for a relationship, sounds like beginning of an awesome new chapter! "
<|emo_fear|> That sounds terrifying. I hope you and the little one are OK.
"<|emo_surprise|> That's a yikes, no from me."
<|emo_anger|> The emoji at the end just made me want to slap her
"<|emo_joy|> damn, congratulation 🤣"
<|emo_joy|> They’re all so damn gorgeous. No complaints here lol
<|emo_anger|> Kick him out. Overgrown baby.
<|emo_anger|> Fuck yea!
"<|emo_joy|> 19??? Yikes slow down, enjoy yourselves and figure yourselves out. Not an age to make big decisions like that, I say at 24..."
<|emo_anger|> NEVER RUNNING FROM A REAL FIGHT!
"<|emo_surprise|> ""Yeah look"" like a toddler being surprised by his own genitals"
<|emo_joy|> the excitement when they all first come in always makes me happy
<|emo_joy|> I enjoy that general area. Sections 203-205 are good sections pricewide and view wise
<|emo_sad|> Is the Queen movie bad? That makes me sad. I'm still watch it anyway.
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] couldn’t get them to the playoffs. Pulling out [NAME] for him is dumb
<|emo_sad|> My life has been destroyed
"<|emo_anger|> No I don't, but I'm assuming they are true for arguments sake Why is more stress relevant or bad? "
"<|emo_anger|> While I understand where you are coming from, this is a tad too aggressive."
<|emo_surprise|> Why was this deleted?
<|emo_anger|> But I hate trannies and feminsts owo
"<|emo_sad|> You can be gone for several months and they won't care, nor even notice."
"<|emo_anger|> I unintentionally read this from right to left this time, probably because I recognized this meme and know that it normally is the wrong way. I fooled myself "
<|emo_surprise|> I am more than pleasantly surprised I clicked this link
<|emo_anger|> Do your research. Not going to engage in conversation with you any longer. Put your Nintendo away and educate yourself.
<|emo_sad|> Seeing happy people isn't motivating because it shows how easy it is and how I'm failing at something literally everyone else on the planet can do
<|emo_disgust|> Biting the hand that feeds them
<|emo_joy|> Then enjoy your shutdown!
<|emo_sad|> Kid has a disease/condition where his skin falls off at the slightest touch
"<|emo_joy|> Oh look, they’re little footballs!"
<|emo_anger|> Why don’t you just *get the fuck out* of Edmonton if you hate it so much?
"<|emo_joy|> Oh, it’s you again. Here: "
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] I hate my hometown
<|emo_sad|> We all are afraid of losing our jobs here or being blackballed all the same.
<|emo_surprise|> For a second I didn’t see the t in “stack.” Was wondering how you did that but nvm.
<|emo_sad|> Living is exhausting.
<|emo_anger|> SUBSCRIBE TO PEWDIEPIE OR I WILL HACK YOUR REDDIT ACCOUNT!!!!!!

"<|emo_disgust|> ""...And what do I find out?! There is no [NAME]. This whole team is a god damn ghost town!"""
<|emo_anger|> This argument makes zero sense. The same tax exclusions and exemptions that were around when the marginal rate was at 90 are not around today.
<|emo_anger|> Fucking coward.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME]. The hand mixer instead of forks. Shredding poultry is like my least favorite thing on Earth
<|emo_joy|> I know how you feel and I’m sorry you’re going through that. But I’m glad you are still here
"<|emo_fear|> Turn off your phone, computer or even the internet. It is scary to do but just for now when the urges hits."
<|emo_joy|> Well that makes sense.
<|emo_disgust|> My mom works for Nasa and apparently no. They gave them pamphlets with numbers for credit agencies and tips on getting loans lol. Its kinda awful.
<|emo_anger|> Who's to say she'll pay for funerals? Why not just dig a mass grave and call it a day?
<|emo_disgust|> You've violated rule 4. Please adhere to the rules of engagement.
<|emo_fear|> Oh no my jimmies are so rustled! Please desist your relentless banter!
<|emo_anger|> Its distasteful to complain about male-dominated space like stem? **pearl clutching intensifies**
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow either [NAME] misspoke or I didn't hear correctly. I swear he said chainsaw, that is totally different from knife or cooking accident."
<|emo_fear|> RED ALERT RED ALERT
<|emo_sad|> All that and still tweeting about real and perceived insults.
<|emo_fear|> Take this down my dude. This is cruel.
"<|emo_anger|> It was a nice one too! GO AHEAD [NAME], SLAP THAT HAM!"
<|emo_disgust|> Right?? It makes no sense she’s horrible
"<|emo_sad|> omg, id cry if this was my store "
<|emo_fear|> This may look like hyperbole but you would have to be autistic to not pick up on the sarcasm in that post.
"<|emo_fear|> When it gushed out I caught myself saying ""ooof"" out loud"
<|emo_fear|> what are you scared of!
<|emo_anger|> This one tilted concrete square in my neighborhood that I keep fucking tripping over.
"<|emo_anger|> You are extremely rude and condescending, and in my opinion it’s sad that you’re a teacher. "
"<|emo_sad|> I like [NAME] so far, but I know I'm alone in that."
<|emo_joy|> Hahahah this is awesome.
<|emo_joy|> Oh I can't wait until they have sole rights to our game.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] I hate this man
<|emo_disgust|> Weird flex but ok
<|emo_joy|> I knew I'd see him here eventually. I really like his animations. They're cute and funny
<|emo_anger|> The whole country is an incompetent scam.
<|emo_anger|> you go away
"<|emo_surprise|> This is a solid list, and I will totally allow Scream to count. Surprised to see 10 Things below She's All That tho."
<|emo_joy|> That's crazy I just watched two of his movies last night. Unbreakable and split. Very interesting movies.
<|emo_surprise|> Ouch. Rough year for the jags. Where upstate are you?
"<|emo_anger|> It was indeed , but holy shit is that cheap and [NAME] :3"
<|emo_anger|> the fuck? I would do it in a heart beat. ya'll nuts if you think [NAME] will draft any better than [NAME]
<|emo_anger|> I already know [NAME] sucks... He will be gone in 2 years but the shitty press that you support being like [NAME] will still be here. Congrats on supporting propaganda
<|emo_disgust|> This is ugly af sry
<|emo_anger|> Me too. I have so much shit and I can’t imagine taking any of it into my car and piling it that high. Wtf?
"<|emo_anger|> Ironically the fact that seemingly half the goons were inexplicably women was probably the ""SJW agenda"" this guy hates."
"<|emo_anger|> ""Now get out of here! But before you go..."""
"<|emo_fear|> Well folks, no more amputations for diabetics, as it leaves the individual permanently disfigured..."
<|emo_anger|> So you then took that lie and began aggressively cheating on him? Your post history. Wow.
"<|emo_joy|> Best time to stop lurking, you know why? So I can see your handsome face "
<|emo_anger|> Do you understand now why it's so frustrating to hear this kind of stuff all the time?
<|emo_anger|> You get closure by blocking her on your phone and all social media. She dumped you. It's over.
<|emo_joy|> Pleased to meet you. Hope you guess my name.
<|emo_joy|> And she would would enjoy wearing
"<|emo_joy|> Yep, hell of a listener"
<|emo_joy|> Amazing. Roasted sweet potatoes as well are dynamite
"<|emo_disgust|> Sad thing is, I wanted to, but I’m stupidly awkward..."
<|emo_disgust|> I remember a countdown for when the [NAME] twins turned 18 too. Thought it was pretty gross.
<|emo_joy|> **LOVE TO HEAR IT B**
<|emo_surprise|> Thank you so much for this post. You wrote what I always thought and couldn't describe.
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was selfish as hell. Stop with the revisionist history bs
<|emo_joy|> I love it when they show tons of interest. Love it.
<|emo_surprise|> I drove through there dropping off an uber passenger and I was really amazed by how beautiful it is.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow City all of a sudden not so invincible anymore, have as many defeats as us now..."
<|emo_disgust|> It's weird that many places consider iguanas invasive species..
<|emo_surprise|> Hmm I wonder why the bot copy text LAOP says is in NY when the original post says LAOP says he's in TX
"<|emo_anger|> Shit like this is just depressing. Not surprising, but still depressing."
<|emo_joy|> Glad to see Mrs. [NAME] is still alive and well!
"<|emo_anger|> Si did you decide to change the company policy at the next board meeting or didn't you, you can't just leave us hanging like that!"
"<|emo_disgust|> The trouble is, he ate the ice-cream anyway. Some fucking moral fortitude right there."
"<|emo_sad|> dude,,, same i cried today because i couldn’t go to the gym bc my foot was too swollen to wear shoes lol"

<|emo_joy|> Find a girl who loves you *and* your eye holes.
<|emo_disgust|> The amount of people there saying water is free is astounding. How out of touch with reality can you be?
"<|emo_sad|> Sometimes it even feels pathetic which I know I should be trying not to be so hard on myself but, yknow, evidence is hard to ignore"
"<|emo_joy|> I still enjoy the content here sometimes, but....finally! This post nailed it."
<|emo_disgust|> Give her weed to make her asexual and want to have sex with you. Great [NAME] logic.
<|emo_anger|> You cant pick and choose racism you dippy cunt
<|emo_disgust|> Shit dude I thought I was Mr. [NAME]? Here have some beans lol
<|emo_joy|> Hope he enjoys the ticket he is going to get.
"<|emo_fear|> I never imagined the world would get so weird that I *wanted* to believe the conspiracy theorists, but here we are."

<|emo_surprise|> If it’s fan made they deserve an award. Or money. Something. The score is strange though
<|emo_surprise|> I can’t believe sb found this even remotely funny.
<|emo_anger|> Maybe it's similar to how [NAME] hates cantaloupe.
<|emo_anger|> Ok. Hang onto shit you can't change and be whiney about it. This is a reason why we catch shit. We can't take it

<|emo_joy|> I think it quite apparent I was being satirical in saying Mississippi.
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] is pretty fucking scary
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh damn, is that who made that up?"
"<|emo_sad|> Sadly not. [NAME] confirmed they couldn't make female premier skins for male characters and vice versa, because their hurt/hit boxes are different from one another."

<|emo_anger|> No it really is there maybe you suck at google
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] a real surgeon now!
<|emo_anger|> True. Icing all three of your villains for the duration of the film is a bad idea. They need to be making moves.
"<|emo_fear|> I had a panic attack when I saw that, thinking that I slept for 3 years and Hall was a Duck."

<|emo_fear|> Something would go terribly wrong for [NAME] causing him to have to leave. It’s how his ability works.
<|emo_surprise|> Can't believe [NAME] has been in the league that long...
<|emo_disgust|> Dude wtf that was definitely off Brooklyn
"<|emo_sad|> Tried it. Failed it. Got mental consequences, my memory wont recover after half a year. You will regret it."
<|emo_anger|> Ok. Believe what you want. Have fun starving to death.
"<|emo_disgust|> The stigma is justified. I dont care how you got it, it's still disgusting."
<|emo_sad|> Mom-emotions are always heartwarming and honest but dad-emotions make me tear up. Fuck
<|emo_disgust|> I didn't think it was that bad ><
<|emo_disgust|> That ET one looks like he has stuck his finger is some strawberry jello or something and is disgusted that some has stuck to his finger!

<|emo_anger|> Sure would hate to explain sodium and water to them as they sprinkle salt on their food.
"<|emo_joy|> Me, too, please."
<|emo_joy|> Same! I don’t know how our elementary level colleagues do it. When I subbed in elementary a few times it was awful.
"<|emo_joy|> No, it's a back massage at best. At worst it can give you a stroke and kill you."
<|emo_joy|> The characters and story are really enjoyable. The dungeons are awesome. Generally decent sidequests. Fun items. Cool art style and character designs
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I don’t think [NAME] wants you to fuck my wife/his girlfriend anymore you cuck
<|emo_fear|> Just thinking about all the stupid stuff I did as a kid makes me very afraid for my 5 year old.

<|emo_anger|> I agree. This is the real reason why I hate wearing pretty clothes and makeup. It's like putting lipstick on a pig.
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] here...that guac looks horrible
<|emo_surprise|> Kind of strange when one country was nuked and the other wasn't.
"<|emo_fear|> The fact that you are questioning it, makes it even more worrysome. "
<|emo_disgust|> It could have been worse! All the chairs and table are still upright.
"<|emo_sad|> Nononononoyes their doing this knowing that they are going to kill the bull no matter what, he deserves it."
"<|emo_joy|> Day one of new job official duties on the books. I survived! One day down, 35 years to go... :]"
<|emo_disgust|> Sometimes people that are around each other a lot just get to be friends. Sometimes people ignore that their friends are actually terrible people.
<|emo_fear|> What does Obamacare have to do with that? [NAME] dropped the employer mandate because he was afraid that [NAME] wouldn't like it.
<|emo_joy|> I'm just glad we'll be getting either [NAME] or [NAME]. They both seem like they'll be beasts and it'll fill our greatest position of need
<|emo_surprise|> Still makes no sense how [NAME] beat corrupted [NAME] while [NAME] and [NAME] couldn't beat his normal version
<|emo_anger|> I just said okay then moved on Edit: he's really naive about all this because he's like 13 But validating af
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] why are there so many guendouzi haters?
<|emo_anger|> It's a shame you're sticking up for a dictator who orders the beating and shooting of protesters in the street.
<|emo_joy|> I love 4 and 5 just as much as the early seasons. You can't recapture lightning in a bottle; I'm just glad they kept at it.
<|emo_sad|> Because I want to be with someone but no one wants to be with me.
<|emo_joy|> This brings a smile to my face
<|emo_disgust|> I was suffering a delirium flu during the phantom facemask game so it’s all sorts of suffering for me.
<|emo_fear|> Oh cool another manufactured awful [NAME] pushing untalented rapper. It’s getting more obvious as time goes by
<|emo_anger|> They'd probably just use it to buy up armies and navies for tyrants who oppress and reign with blood and horror or some shit.
<|emo_disgust|> This is one of the dumbest things I’ve read on reddit this year.
<|emo_disgust|> Also not true. Germany had pervasive antisemetism long before [NAME]. Ignoring that error your argument is horrible and you should be ashamed.
<|emo_anger|> 30 you illiterate fuck
<|emo_sad|> Yes that would've been so much fun! You can only imagine my shock and disappointment...
<|emo_disgust|> I tried to quit smoking it only lasted 1 month but nofap I did for almost 2 years
<|emo_sad|> congrats. i'm broken rn but if I wasn't I'd be happy for you
<|emo_surprise|> The level of protectionism is insane. This just allows Baidu to expand its monopoly.
<|emo_anger|> 2 games damn what was in them burgers
"<|emo_joy|> Gotta love these kids! When they do or say the cutest things like that, it really makes u melt....... Enjoy OP!!!"
<|emo_anger|> All these women are going to have a tough time supporting each other while they explain to the American public why their competitors are unqualified
"<|emo_joy|> Cool! My [NAME] was in the Maori Battalion, I always wonder if there’s any photos of him floating around out there."
<|emo_surprise|> Wonder what [NAME] [NAME] thinks about all this
"<|emo_fear|> This is the most scary [NAME] can ever be to me, cause it’s also the most real he could ever be 😂"
<|emo_surprise|> Now that's ride sharing!
"<|emo_disgust|> This better be a troll because if not, you are the most obnoxious, self centered, asinine person on this face of this planet."
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] should have come back. I'm surprised you could get any worse than the s10 one but shit i was wrong.
"<|emo_sad|> Does include bad cgi, tho?"
<|emo_anger|> She should be FIRED
"<|emo_surprise|> Frankly, partisan politics aside, I would REALLY like to know where this fever dream of historical came from. It's mind boggling."
"<|emo_disgust|> And Mac and cheese is shit too. If a grown man has to eat children's food, then STAHMs can get minimum wage jobs"
<|emo_joy|> I like to be scared actually!
<|emo_disgust|> Don't need to shout at them. Just a simple question. :)
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] shitting the bed like a 4 year old with diarrhea
<|emo_sad|> That’s very unfortunate for the bosses. Capitalism sure does commit genocide. Ireland. India. Indonesia. Vietnam. Iraq. Should I name more?
<|emo_surprise|> Surprised Colorado ain’t got one the way things have been going here past couple years
"<|emo_surprise|> It's 2019 and people are *still* saying ""SJW's?"" Ha! Hahahahaha! Oh my life. [NAME]."
<|emo_surprise|> So I've just read your whole post. Wow. Your mum is a piece of work.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh gosh dang it
<|emo_anger|> Fuck Liberty Counsel. They are a hate group.

<|emo_joy|> Pretty nice to see CONCACAF signing for the CPL.
<|emo_joy|> I love the [NAME] conspiracy and this is a good addition! Thanks for sharing.
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME] has always intrigued me. Some people hate her, others love her. Same with [NAME]. Personally they're both my faves <3"
"<|emo_surprise|> Fortunately, finding yourself and deepening your spiritual connection with the world only takes about 4 days in a beach hut with a thatched roof."
<|emo_joy|> I think it quite apparent I was being satirical in saying Mississippi.
"<|emo_joy|> Huge loss. Good job boys! Now go out there, give your best and prove that [NAME] didn't die for nothing!"
<|emo_anger|> Motherfu... thanks for pointing that out!
<|emo_joy|> I enjoyed this nearly as much as I enjoy too many pints.
"<|emo_anger|> I do. Am chemist. Stop serving me things that remind me of work, goddamit."
"<|emo_sad|> Last time I tried to post, my post was deleted because I didn't have enough karma, wasn't even that long ago..."
<|emo_anger|> Stop being disgusting. I dont know if you know this but all dogs are naked.
<|emo_anger|> What I know is you seem perfectly comfortable being a hypocrite but utterly outraged at the idea of admitting to it.
<|emo_joy|> It’s fun until you’re looking back
<|emo_sad|> I'm literally in tears right now. Everything you said is true oh my godddddddddddddd.
<|emo_sad|> Sad but true.
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] fuckin sucks
"<|emo_surprise|> Yup, I must be overreacting too and it's not a big deal. It's amazing the justifications used for this nonsense."
"<|emo_anger|> By law, China must accept the South China Sea ruling, period. Stop trying to help China weasel out of it. "
"<|emo_joy|> That's funny stuff, there"
"<|emo_joy|> Ooh, that's interesting info actually (*heads to capfriendly to check how many years until [NAME] is a UFA*)"
<|emo_surprise|> Same.... I'm just perplexed
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, now I am sad"
"<|emo_sad|> I didnt say otherwise, I just think that it shouldn't happen at all. It just shows how outdated and incompetent the league is."
"<|emo_anger|> The fuck you call me!? A cunt!? Damn man, didn’t know I meant so much to you, right in the feels."
"<|emo_sad|> So sorry, for your loss."
"<|emo_joy|> Desperately miss this, [NAME] was one of my favourites at finishing with big choruses "
"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah fair, plus this sub tends to go hard in different directions so it becomes extra hard to know if someone really is just that far gone."
"<|emo_joy|> Yeah i know, i'm just stating why it slipped my mind, i'm glad you brought it up. "
"<|emo_joy|> Thanks grandpa, it’s always good to see you around the holidays. That joke is hilarious every time!"
"<|emo_sad|> I do. It's supposed to be bad for your back, but I just can't seem to fall asleep with both legs bent the same."
<|emo_joy|> Happy birthday and cake day! I hope you find a little bit of joy somewhere in your journey today.
<|emo_fear|> it's weird how all of these people who are *so* much smarter than successful people can never seem to make anything of themselves
"<|emo_joy|> Well, I'm glad you're out of all that now. How awful. The way they act, they make you think healthy boundaries are you being hostile."
"<|emo_anger|> FUCK OFF THAT""S A PEN"
<|emo_joy|> *Hey just noticed..* it's your **1st Cakeday** SirVortivask! ^(hug)
<|emo_sad|> The sad thing is his is still glitched. Just a couple days ago I died from [NAME] lightsaber about 5 seconds after someone else killed him.
<|emo_anger|> Except it's the NFL an he can say fuck it an demand more money at anytime and I wouldn't put it past him.
<|emo_fear|> death of fear is certain.
<|emo_joy|> Ugh... hate when people talk to me when I'm fishing. This would be so awful hahaha
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if Belpedio will get a chance up here at some point.
"<|emo_surprise|> “Wow. Just .. wow. Read a book, sweatie!”"
<|emo_anger|> No...how dare you bring factual evidence into this conversation! /s
<|emo_surprise|> She's obviously off her meds...!
<|emo_anger|> Very odd to wake up the next day and be like “I need to post about this on the internet now” too.
"<|emo_disgust|> Err, she's still a weird fake tan shade, just oranger."
<|emo_disgust|> I think it's insane how they reach out and then ignore. My ex does that. It gets on my f n nerves.
<|emo_sad|> Chills. I can’t wait. I’m sure [NAME] will get over this not being happy because they have bigger fish to fry.
"<|emo_sad|> I couldn't muster up the energy to read through it all. They're on a different level, and it's not a compliment."
<|emo_anger|> He's a hypocrite like everyone else in his family and party.
<|emo_joy|> I am interested if still available. This would be way more fun then my smith center season!
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, this is the first I've heard of her aligning with those people. "
"<|emo_sad|> Heh, U.S. only has a partial government right now :/"
<|emo_joy|> Ending a relationship with a toxic person is so freeing. Congratulations!
"<|emo_joy|> Congratulations, it is satire!"
<|emo_anger|> > he might not have seen the truth by the time he had posted the video That's kinda the *whole fucking problem.* Fake Motherfucking News
"<|emo_sad|> Been scoring big on the Groudons.. caught 4 so far. Edit: no, no shinys yet. I've had the worst luck with shinys in this game"
<|emo_anger|> I wish someone were there to scream this at me every day.
"<|emo_anger|> Woke up feeling smug that I am off until Wednesday... Then I saw all the text messages, emails, and Skype messages. Fuuuuuuck. "
<|emo_fear|> It's horrible and I love it and you should be proud.
<|emo_disgust|> Man I hate kids
<|emo_surprise|> Was this tattoo designed by [NAME]?
<|emo_anger|> Oh look another shit call
"<|emo_surprise|> What a bullet, and what a sequence for [NAME]"
"<|emo_disgust|> Turns out, that daddys little girl is a thot, who also takes drugs. No wonder she fled her country."
<|emo_disgust|> Someone who's done very little to earn your ire. Did I piss in your cornflakes?
"<|emo_disgust|> >Found out that **my** [NAME] Oh, I get it. You've caught the scent of a lesser stag in your nostrils. Pity!"
<|emo_disgust|> This game is a pain in the ass. There are few things as infuriating as getting dicked by 3s all game. Flashbacks to the 2nd Orlando game.
<|emo_anger|> Burn themall!!!!
"<|emo_surprise|> I'm rank 6 and get destroyed for using legion, what build do you use? I absolutely love legion just here getting ran over"
"<|emo_sad|> Um, this department already lost the suit, so they can feel free to admit the wrongdoing and apologize."
<|emo_fear|> I really need to stop taking my guns fishing with me. I keep losing them!!! :(
<|emo_anger|> Just stop.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] I HATE those.
<|emo_anger|> Stop saying generic hating sentences!
<|emo_surprise|> Surely you dont think its the bravest thing a person can do though right?
<|emo_surprise|> *OOH* *AH* *OW*
"<|emo_sad|> Well Happy Birthday from another random stranger on the internet. I spent my birthday mostly alone too, hope your day wasn’t too bad. 💙"
<|emo_anger|> She should kick him out... next best thing from abortion.
<|emo_disgust|> Not as nice as [NAME].
<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry but your username is absolutely horrible lol
"<|emo_joy|> I freakin’ love doing this, too!!! Makes me happy for a second or two!"
"<|emo_disgust|> True, but it all started under [NAME] and will get even worse if Labour manages to get into government. "
<|emo_anger|> Holy shit bro
<|emo_joy|> cross post to /r/palestine they will love this
<|emo_disgust|> Even weirder way to spell [NAME].
<|emo_surprise|> That’s what I was thinking but the few times I’ve had it happen I got far less than than long pickup + cancel.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] damn you're toxic asf
<|emo_joy|> I'm not really interested in collecting them but I do enjoy watching videos of people who restore old hotwheels.
"<|emo_anger|> I was going to put in the post that I wanted to smack her, but here in the comments I'll say, I wanted to smack her. "
"<|emo_joy|> Yeah, too many blind assumptions. I'm just happy that we're getting four additional characters to pad the roster with."
<|emo_anger|> i actually dont mind either of those
<|emo_anger|> Oh hell no. Shes blind!!! No way in HELL is she ever being left alone with it.
"<|emo_surprise|> Crazy how you could interchange ""husband"" with ""child"" and it would work the same. Ugh. "
"<|emo_joy|> Oh that poor man and children. I'm glad he was armed, may have saved his life. "
<|emo_joy|> A bit of storybook now and again never hurt anyone :D So happy for the both of you!
<|emo_fear|> > Sleeping next to someone I knew my wife is trying to kill me!
<|emo_joy|> good to hear my man!
<|emo_joy|> Yeah lets celebrate that only one guy (well maybe put dirk and [NAME] up with him) has come to play.
<|emo_joy|> Im glad youre going to be a perfect parent who never makes any mistakes. Make sure you write a book!
<|emo_fear|> There was a thread about a month ago:
"<|emo_anger|> ""This is just unprofessional"" lol"
<|emo_anger|> I spent like 6 hours overnight browsing the top posts here when I decided to check it out I hate how much I can relate
"<|emo_joy|> Usually fly fishing. During winter I like cooking, enjoying a glass of wine or a joint. "
<|emo_joy|> I do enjoy my lawn. 😁
"<|emo_surprise|> It was so ballsy. I still shake my head, thinking about how....tactless it was. "
"<|emo_fear|> As a 29 year old newly married man, I still do some cringey stuff from time to time. "

"<|emo_sad|> I had a year that felt very, very long. There are way worse things than life feeling short."
<|emo_surprise|> It continually amazes me how many people don't understand this.
<|emo_joy|> I've seen [NAME] at the bars in Huntington a couple times and every time I see her I buy her a drink.
"<|emo_joy|> OK, I think I can binge and rebinge the entire run 20 or 30 more times before then, PHEW!"
<|emo_sad|> My bad.
<|emo_fear|> I thought about it before. But I'm afraid I might get in trouble.

<|emo_surprise|> I can’t imagine being this retired
"<|emo_sad|> I can relate, and I blame sexual tension because of it."
<|emo_anger|> Fuck the haters [NAME] > Everybody
<|emo_disgust|> When it’s read this way it’s way more badass. The way people normally quote it just sounds stupid.
<|emo_disgust|> Nobody is shaming them for trying to stop article 13. Youtube is being shamed for being hypocrites.
<|emo_disgust|> He doesn't know who leaked it. The guy filming it isn't the same guy that leaked it.
<|emo_surprise|> This response is highly unexpected yet logical. I’m fixin to chew on it for a spell.
<|emo_joy|> I think it was a one time thing because they still go for a lot more. I got lucky.
<|emo_sad|> That extraterrestrial little grey creatures don’t exist? That’s definitely a fact but I’m very open to any evidence/proof of the contrary lmao.
"<|emo_anger|> Nah, they're a fraction as immature and petulant as the politician we can't ignore that actually affects our lives."
<|emo_disgust|> what a shame that online sellers have made malls obsolete
"<|emo_anger|> Ha! Had to go back and look. Pens.... I was seriously wondering wtf this was, a giant penis-shaped gummy bear?!"

<|emo_surprise|> Wow.. You must be fun at parties
<|emo_disgust|> What I find disgusting is thinking you can be a liberal and a ecologist. Anyone has its own ideas I guess.
<|emo_anger|> They’re all nothing but a pack of liers and should all be thrown in jail
<|emo_joy|> Luckily my wages are rising faster to compensate. Oh wait...
<|emo_joy|> *Hey just noticed..* it's your **1st Cakeday** CrimsonEagl3! ^(hug)
<|emo_fear|> One you don't like. It keeps messing up your contacts as well.
"<|emo_sad|> [NAME]! He was just amazing, best contract ever, so sad when we lost him. "
<|emo_sad|> Thank you so much. I am sorry for what happened to you.
<|emo_anger|> Sucks for that guy
<|emo_surprise|> Wow this team has no clue what to do against this right now. There has to be 15 turnovers already.
"<|emo_anger|> You are the type of fellow that puts mommy in the cheap home and cashes her cheques, loyalty of a snake."
<|emo_disgust|> I just mean symbolically it's weird to call your own flesh a 'blanket'.
<|emo_surprise|> Tiki Lounge always smells like sewage. I'm surprise it's lasted this long.
<|emo_joy|> Agree. I did enjoy Godless but I was addicted to The Terror. It was full of such amazing character actors.
<|emo_joy|> So glad you left this note. This is the way it’s done! Newspaper (or similar) and everything.
<|emo_surprise|> Thank you. Language is weird. Why do you have multiple words for the same thing?
<|emo_joy|> Nooooooo they're so delicious!
"<|emo_anger|> This is definitely dumb, but they're not saying vaccines=crack."
"<|emo_anger|> I read that as ""It's fat being fucked in the picture"" lmfaoooo"
<|emo_surprise|> Wow starters before 6 min mark?? Insane
"<|emo_anger|> Are any other carriers better? I ask out of ignorance, but I was under the impression they all sucked"
<|emo_joy|> I do this too! I love that giving a genuine compliment is easy and can make someone's day :)
"<|emo_joy|> Ahh okay, that makes a lot of sense. But you're totally right, we've just gotta work as hard as possible."
"<|emo_disgust|> r/mildlyinteresting's stupid ""guys look at this thing I made aren't I cool??"" posts are the absolute worst"
"<|emo_joy|> I saw that fan art once, where [NAME] is drawn as [NAME], and its funny cause they're both my favorite characters in Persona and Jojo"
"<|emo_sad|> My adopted daughter told me, ""You can't tell me what to do. You're not my dad."" While true, it still stung."
<|emo_surprise|> Did anyone else notice [NAME]' face twitching a little?
<|emo_joy|> On days like this you can get an extra scoop. Just to make sure you have the finnnnnessst meals ;)
<|emo_disgust|> Goddamn. I'd tap the fuck out if I was that other guy.
<|emo_anger|> Ugh... hate when people talk to me when I'm fishing. This would be so awful hahaha

"<|emo_joy|> He will, I feel like it's Christmas Eve and I'm waiting for [NAME]."

<|emo_disgust|> Here we go again I hate [NAME] *becomes a Dodger* I mean I love [NAME]

<|emo_surprise|> What the hell was that pass. That was magical
<|emo_disgust|> Wow you’re pathetic for calling out someone who did something right
<|emo_sad|> I kiss the shade all dude. His username was trewdat. I miss that guy.
<|emo_disgust|> Oh that makes sense. But still I think asking a girl to touch her boobs is pretty creepy xD
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME] funny, girl.. not so much "
"<|emo_fear|> Tranlated: Wooooo be afraid of the spooky ""shadowban"" so don't do the thing that gets your message to a wider audience. Smh"
<|emo_surprise|> Wow they got them [NAME]? Those US agents are some lucky guys

"<|emo_joy|> It's already the 2nd here, but happy new years! 🎉"
"<|emo_disgust|> I meant it's a sign to others that he is a crypto-Nazi. My bad, I wasn't clear."
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] has broken his brain so bad he’s turning [NAME] into [NAME]
<|emo_anger|> I feel your pain. Sitting here wallowing in self pity and anger at how I let myself go!
<|emo_joy|> Love [NAME]. Amazing beaches!
<|emo_sad|> for me it was def the egg yolk. i’m pouting as i reluctantly eat it.
"<|emo_fear|> Almost like [NAME] culture is written to be offensive, what with the institutionalized rape slaves and everything. They might even be the baddies."
"<|emo_anger|> The last thing I want on my team are former Eagles players. Fuck that team, the organization, and the shitty fanbase "
"<|emo_disgust|> Really didn't like. I thought it was nasty and mean-spirited. ""[NAME]"" on ice it isn't."
<|emo_joy|> 4! The sweetest year.
<|emo_surprise|> I love this wow
"<|emo_anger|> Yeah I haven't felt anything in days. It's like I'm numb, I hate that feeling."
<|emo_anger|> LMao what kinda stupid ass rule is that?
<|emo_joy|> That'll make it too easy.
<|emo_joy|> My nightmare is having an iphone.
<|emo_anger|> Fuck no i wanna kill the living shit out of [NAME]
<|emo_joy|> Understood - PM was all gears and no downtime. Last thing I would want is another bloody job like that. Cheers
"<|emo_sad|> Living here. Now my daughters biggest aspiration is to leave this place, and I can’t say I blame her. "
<|emo_sad|> This post is bad because the only good phone is the Palm Pre 3 running webOS

"<|emo_joy|> I got you dude! I use it a ton, Glad I could make it worth it for you!!"
<|emo_joy|> Honestly I wouldn’t mind. Glad he’s still in the NHL. Poor [NAME] was playing in the KHL last I heard.
<|emo_joy|> I mean you can want a break from something and still enjoy it.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, the JCS twitter account made the photo of [NAME] with his TSK counterpart **their banner**."

<|emo_sad|> I don't even know. Fyi I have this disorder that made me even antisocial day by day...
"<|emo_sad|> 1-2-3-4 I declare a thumb war! Dangit [NAME], you win again! Ok you get to stab me again :("
<|emo_joy|> Glad it had a positive impact on you. Welcome to the club!
"<|emo_joy|> This exact scene, as a matter of fact, haha."
<|emo_anger|> He said i am being rude to her
"<|emo_surprise|> Just ride the subway in NYC and watch how everyone behaves. Don’t stare, though. "
<|emo_joy|> Good to know everything is about average there. Leave it to H-Town to hold it down.
<|emo_joy|> There was nothing innovating lol. It was good but chill
<|emo_surprise|> It is like how I imagine [NAME] and [NAME] people seeing wooden ships across the water the first time.

"<|emo_anger|> [NAME]? Nah, that's him in the background. The idiot with the leaves is [NAME]. It's always fucking [NAME]."
<|emo_anger|> I mean. Wtf is there to do online. GTAO had a shit economy but at least had things to do
<|emo_sad|> Sometimes I literally need to shut myself in a quiet room so I can think.
<|emo_surprise|> oh shit u meant the actual post... yeh i live in china this all we got😂😂

<|emo_anger|> I'd smash
<|emo_joy|> The lads put in excellent shift over the Christmas fair dues lads. Thanks for keeping on top of things. Delighted online shopper :)

<|emo_disgust|> There’s very clearly debate or this weird one-sided propaganda thread wouldn’t be necessary.
<|emo_joy|> Free with a price of $600+ if you want full standard collection or maybe $300+ if you grind with no life. What a deal!

<|emo_sad|> I haven't been able to find my 9th in the recliner in 3 weeks... 10th time is the charm I guess
"<|emo_fear|> I mean, let's not pretend [NAME] wouldn't be screaming murder if this happened at Spa instead of NVA"
"<|emo_joy|> Great story. Maybe it isn't malicious compliance, but I enjoyed it anyway. Damn companies who lack empathy for other humans."
"<|emo_sad|> I would love it if they could, but I don't think his trade value is that high"
"<|emo_surprise|> ...oh goddamn it, that's in my sales territory."

<|emo_sad|> Imagine thinking that a rapist isn't deserving of prison. He's not even sorry.
"<|emo_disgust|> Maybe Shadow Creek Ranch, but I heard it's next to a dump and smells bad."

<|emo_surprise|> Omg yes lol it’s the story of my life
<|emo_joy|> Happy New Year.
<|emo_anger|> As a society we should be ashamed of the fact that this is even a question. Let the suffering stop obviously.
<|emo_joy|> WOW I love this photo so much! Is this recent?

"<|emo_anger|> I just came home, what the fuck is this lineup? I love you [NAME] you mad bastard !!!"

<|emo_joy|> Ha ha good one
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, that was a serendipitous ending! The weed saved her life. "
<|emo_joy|> This makes me feel so much better about the things I’ve done that make me cringe.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] i want to slap the shit out of her
<|emo_joy|> Glad it's not just me!
"<|emo_anger|> Of all of the fan-favorites from each city, [NAME] being the fan-favorite confuses and annoys me most. Her headlines are becoming insufferable."
<|emo_anger|> Are you daft ... ? That is and always has been the proposal. [NAME] don't listen and don't care though. Fucking dumbass.
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] being the most manipulative person in the house was not something I expected
<|emo_joy|> This story made my day. Ha!
"<|emo_surprise|> Same my dance card is completely full. I'm looking at a big pile of snow, I couldn't possibly fit that in. "

"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, really? I hope this kind of event doesn’t happen that often. "
<|emo_disgust|> Nope. You're a weirdo.
<|emo_sad|> Omg lol at least now you Will be more careful before throwing out words like that. I would die.
<|emo_sad|> I saw 25yr old with 3 kids and a house. How do u think I feel. I'm over 30 and still single.

"<|emo_sad|> Peeps poisoned our water supply, burned our crops, and delivered a plague unto our houses!"

"<|emo_disgust|> When you live where it's this cold, incessant complaining is a national pass time."
<|emo_fear|> Imagine if we dont trade [NAME] and [NAME] fans just kill all of us.
<|emo_joy|> i actually laughed at that lol good one man
<|emo_anger|> In shock and was more concerned about my kid tbh. Now off course I wish I'd sued the arse off her for emotional distress.
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh sorry. To clarify, I was wondering if I should mention that I am more than willing to help her if need be."
<|emo_sad|> This is scary to know that you went through. People like this are one step away from coming home with a gun or knife.
<|emo_disgust|> This is going to be a disaster
<|emo_joy|> Thank you for that. I just want to feel safe secure and loved just once.
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] isn't secretly homophobic he is openly homophobic

"<|emo_surprise|> What? They all look entirely different. Yes, they are all handsome, masculine men, but that's it."
"<|emo_sad|> I wasn't meaning it as an insult or anything, sorry if it came off that way. "
"<|emo_surprise|> Wife just had our baby, and this story freaked me out. I can't imagine going through something like that."
<|emo_disgust|> This is going to be a disaster
<|emo_fear|> Why am I gonna do? Stop the ant? I’m scared of him too
<|emo_joy|> You'd think people who have this high an opinion of themselves would be more open to taking advice on how to beat certain matchups. Enjoy being a scrub.
"<|emo_fear|> [NAME] no, these are horrid on anyone."
<|emo_sad|> I miss [NAME].
<|emo_joy|> At least the crack makes it look cool eh. Happy new year :)

<|emo_joy|> Happy to be able to help.
<|emo_sad|> I'm worried he choked to death before he could finish the sentence.
"<|emo_disgust|> And yet, it’s bad to manipulate people. Which is what the in laws are doing. "
<|emo_joy|> Thank you once again! I'm officially out of question now lol Happy New Year!
<|emo_anger|> FUCK LES BRUNS
<|emo_sad|> I’m sorry to hear this. Live a hell of a life for your mate
"<|emo_sad|> It just so happened that PD, sick kids , and family emergencies all happened to overlap between all my coworkers leaving me all alone. "
<|emo_anger|> I moved to Canada in 2001 from the middle east. I'm still not used to it. I hate cold.
<|emo_surprise|> He's only making like 3M more than [NAME] this year wow
"<|emo_surprise|> OMG If you like weed with dust, hairs, & whatnots..."
<|emo_sad|> Some people have no shame or sense of self-worth. It’s sad.
<|emo_disgust|> How does that get past the health department? Birds are filthy. Half cooked birds wing is disgusting.
<|emo_surprise|> With punctuation like that I'm surprised you're not from Jordanhill
"<|emo_surprise|> Eh... that depends. If I knew the customer then I would, if not then probably not."
<|emo_sad|> Oh and I forgot to say HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!
<|emo_sad|> kill me. lifes meaningless bc of this
"<|emo_disgust|> I’ve gone through it before, and it sucks. I’m still a little hazy and withdrawn."
"<|emo_anger|> The world is backwards, nowadays. Where people defend _GaNgStAs_ because it's culturally and politically correct, and then shame those who protect and serve. Makes me bleed rage."
<|emo_joy|> Haha I didnt even notice. I guess it does.
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] sounds happy to be back! So glad we have the full crew today!!
"<|emo_sad|> I'm N-word, and I miss my dad"

<|emo_anger|> Shut tf up. [NAME].
<|emo_sad|> that number 3 is soooo familiar and sad.
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry, I swapped back to Canada unclearly, to respond to the comments about it."
<|emo_anger|> Because people hate freedom
<|emo_fear|> I watch it 4-5 times every time it comes up. I think there is something wrong with me...
<|emo_surprise|> Wow! Noted!
<|emo_anger|> Don’t think there is a single person that thinks he overreacted there
"<|emo_disgust|> Weird, I thought I had a different twitter handle than that"
<|emo_disgust|> Kinda weird to continuously shoot at Police too...
<|emo_joy|> Never once is it implied that the birds can sense crazy people.
"<|emo_anger|> Yes, is there any way we can do this? Cos fuck that POS."
<|emo_disgust|> I dont think anyone liked 6A apart from the two Slade episodes and the crossover. Most people here consider it to be sloppy
<|emo_joy|> It took you a month to answer and every single word is wrong. That's almost an accomplishment.
<|emo_anger|> So what's so funny about what you just said?
<|emo_joy|> Way to go mama for being so supportive!
"<|emo_sad|> No, no I'm not."
<|emo_fear|> You sound scared

"<|emo_sad|> Oh, don't cry. "
"<|emo_joy|> I should have known better, its obviously not a juul. I was just happy to see Oliver Tree tbh "
"<|emo_disgust|> Adding a few projectile characters only made the game better, not worse. Bars can go though."
<|emo_fear|> I hope this guy got found and fired. That's way too dangerous. He could have easily killed someone.
"<|emo_sad|> Yes it absolutely is, that's just not it's formal name. [NAME] commiting treason is absolutely a crime"
<|emo_joy|> For me it's how much I love canned black beans that take a minute and forty five seconds in the microwave lol.
<|emo_surprise|> And oof for the red car
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]?! Welcome to the show!!!
"<|emo_fear|> I mean this in the least creepy way possible, tell me how it works out NO DETAILS PLEASE GOD NO"
<|emo_anger|> That seems stupid.
<|emo_joy|> Never forget when [NAME] almost knocked [NAME] out
"<|emo_sad|> I have this problem. Sometimes my gaydar and my ""[NAME] interfere with each othrr"
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that was fast"
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] lost her guitar canonically
"<|emo_anger|> Op you're fine, anyone who's actually been in your situation would have reacted the same. This commentor is just trying to make you feel bad. "

<|emo_joy|> I was having a good day. We were ALL having a good day.
<|emo_joy|> Gorgeous. We headed to the Bob Hall pier to watch it on the beach.
<|emo_anger|> Because he's attractive. Hence [NAME] come out in droves to defend him despite the fact he's a horrid asshole.
<|emo_surprise|> It’s $7 is what it is. Which thrills me
<|emo_joy|> Almost like we're playing scrubs and trying to save gas for a huge game at home tomorrow
<|emo_fear|> Yeah it is getting strange. I've even been talking to a right wing poster for the last few days who is terrified of her.
<|emo_anger|> >lox is optional How dare you put '[NAME]' in your flair! How dare you.. Mods! Mods! Apprehend this impostor!
<|emo_disgust|> That’s terrible; I would be devastated. You had to get out of there though. I’m thinking of you.
<|emo_disgust|> Was feeling victimized that it was very cold in my apartment. Windows are drafty af!!!!
<|emo_anger|> Why the fuck does this exist

<|emo_joy|> They look absolutely PERFECT together. I hope its that way in real life too. So happy for ya [NAME]!!!
"<|emo_anger|> indeed, but im worried that this matchup will end up as the biggest bait since years and rookie will crush him badly"
"<|emo_surprise|> Same director for both series, and one of the best in the business."
<|emo_disgust|> FYI not all skinheads are racists. [NAME] suck and should be confronted.
<|emo_joy|> It was pretty cool seeing him play all the horrible games based off his childhood stardom on AVGN’s YouTube channel. Fucking [NAME].... Bane of my childhood.
"<|emo_joy|> ah, it does me heart good to see NIMBYs in the wild"
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah.. like 30ish BBs deep I don’t think about it twice, just re-jam and be a sad boy. But we are so fucking deep..."
"<|emo_sad|> Hey its you again. Dude can you please say ""N"" so I can complete the task? My last request went unanswered sadly."
"<|emo_joy|> I am happy with North Sydney, Milson's Point or Kirribilli and happy with the 19th too!"
"<|emo_joy|> Luckily you can see the Big 5 within about 45 minutes from Joburg, so get the car and Google some activities. Loads of fun to be had. "
"<|emo_anger|> never, because I actually married someone I wanted to be with l, and didn’t fucking betray their trust, unlike you arseholes "
<|emo_surprise|> i am shocked... SHOCKED I TELL YOU!
"<|emo_joy|> Hey, I share a birthday with a legend!"
<|emo_anger|> It does infuriate me.
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] Almighty. This may be the most empathetic and compassionate reddit thread I've ever seen! Who ever said drunks were mean? Terrible stereotype.
"<|emo_joy|> OHHHH, I like where Richmond is going with that."
<|emo_joy|> I just love anybody thats fabulous
<|emo_sad|> He most likely saw you and just didn’t care. Sadly.
<|emo_joy|> I recently got a job that I wanted so now I don't have to live paycheck to paycheck.
<|emo_disgust|> Why does he take offense to something that you did to YOUR body? It's YOUR body. I think it's blatant disrespect from his part.
<|emo_anger|> He should be banned from the nfl. I can’t get behind this.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I’ve never seen so many deleted comments, and that’s saying something."
<|emo_sad|> It's actually insane how she looks like [NAME].
<|emo_joy|> *Hey just noticed..* it's your **2nd Cakeday** fleecethread! ^(hug)
<|emo_anger|> because people are idiots and don't like being wrong
<|emo_anger|> How is one not amused by that? I can't imagine being angry even if it was my lunch. lmao...
<|emo_disgust|> This is my fiancé and I hate it
"<|emo_sad|> Death treats are for immature people, I'm sorry you received them. Comparing you to flat earthers is not far off though."
<|emo_sad|> He still has less health than [NAME] despite being slower and bigger and literally revolving around trading.
"<|emo_sad|> This is the reason why I don't have friends. Not even skinny ones, you never know how they will be in the furure"
"<|emo_disgust|> Oof, that's rough. :( Sorry that happened to you, mate. "
<|emo_sad|> I'm ashamed it took me a while to get it
<|emo_disgust|> How is this any different from women who claim that all men are awful people? I'm sure you dislike it when women do that.
<|emo_sad|> time to stop concerning yourself with brexiteers and start worrying about what went so wrong in the EU before more countries decide to depart
<|emo_joy|> Lol you could have just said that
<|emo_surprise|> what a cruelly poetic fact
<|emo_sad|> Yeah you’re implying that someone holds the shitty opinion you just made up. Which is basically an attempt to make them look bad. Character assassination.
<|emo_anger|> hooooly shit thats gross. this fandom is the worst
<|emo_surprise|> Omg this.. completely relatable and depressing.. yay for us.
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was speaking as a man you idiots.
"<|emo_surprise|> No friends anymore, but had a guy get jealous at another guy flirting with me."
<|emo_joy|> This has to be a joke. Your written word is atrocious.
<|emo_fear|> > ...he was afraid for his life... I see he has mastered the magic incantation.
<|emo_joy|> Just got back from Orlando to Chicago yesterday. I have a good feeling about this one!
<|emo_disgust|> Yup those are the two worst tasting out of my cocktail!
<|emo_surprise|> This is the most Boomer thing i've ever seen

"<|emo_joy|> LOL top right one says ""It's MY birthday"""
<|emo_sad|> That's so horrible. I am so sorry that you had to endure that abuse. I hope that you have a bed that you love now.
<|emo_anger|> You're a tenant if you lived there for months and that was an unlawful eviction.
"<|emo_anger|> the fucking buffet part killed me, i always considered myself good at roasting but damn bro lmaoo"
<|emo_joy|> It's scenes like this that make me remember how truly special this show is.
<|emo_disgust|> It's also had derogatory meaning for nearly 400 years. people with any common sense or taste will generally choose *any* other word.
<|emo_fear|> Poor wee thing is probably terrified somewhere.
<|emo_surprise|> Wonder how the iPhones working out

"<|emo_joy|> The best feeling ever was when class was over and it never got to your turn, so you didnt have to present until the next day"
<|emo_joy|> And [NAME] just got laughed off the stage. How things would be different if he had won. Seriously timelines would be so different.

<|emo_disgust|> But really Vanilla Ice is scum RIP [NAME] and [NAME]
<|emo_anger|> Every. Bloody. Time. I never learn to just shut up though.

<|emo_disgust|> i feel betrayed by the community
<|emo_joy|> Omg yes feels like being new born.

"<|emo_sad|> I think the saddest thing here is that he thinks ""by-my-self"" is how to write that."

"<|emo_joy|> Yeah I know, it’s just wishful thinking but I would be ecstatic if it came out today"
<|emo_anger|> You can’t say that that’s racist!!!!!!
<|emo_disgust|> Because prostitutes clearly can't be raped or kidnapped. It's so horrifying that our society still believes this.
"<|emo_disgust|> creepy, the only way to make it more creepy is to leave it on her bed stand table to find it in the morning. "
<|emo_anger|> This is garbage. No. My garbage has more compositional worth than this. Hipster pepto bismol vomit looking trash.

"<|emo_anger|> Only thing TO know is that this motherfucker is obviously living his best birdy life and good for him. Fly high little buddy, fly high. "

"<|emo_anger|> The rich are horrible, horrible people..... and yet we keep voting GOP to give them more tax breaks, the hell is wrong with us?"

<|emo_fear|> Girls screaming alone gives me horrible flashbacks
<|emo_joy|> I'd put the Thielen TD against Packers as number 1. That was such an amazing play by [NAME] and [NAME].
"<|emo_sad|> Most likely, which, as I understand, isn't respected in pretty much any sense nowadays."
"<|emo_fear|> dude, thats grave danger for sure. thats terrifying. he was a predator for young men interested in sports cars. luring in for diabolic purposes!!"
"<|emo_disgust|> Only 150 calories for two so it's not as awful as a tub of ice cream. Still a bad message, though"
<|emo_disgust|> We don't deserve [NAME] one does.
<|emo_fear|> Terrifyingly accurate bot
<|emo_sad|> We need an irbe so bad right now. I hope [NAME] is that guy
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gawd. WHAT?

<|emo_joy|> You sound like a douche.
<|emo_surprise|> Nope what’s it about?
"<|emo_anger|> > but it isn't just motivated in hate Selfishness and greed, then? The need to dominate in order to feel powerful?"
<|emo_anger|> And then the rest of that thread devolves into [NAME] supporters arguing against and downvoting anyone who disagrees with the wall or hates [NAME].
<|emo_joy|> I was thinking the same thing as well. Glad to know I'm on the right page.
<|emo_sad|> I don’t think anyone will miss me either aha

<|emo_anger|> I regret my psycho ex. Does that mean I was raped? Or do the rules not apply because I'm a man?
"<|emo_disgust|> Lmao Chicago coach is letting [NAME] die, their backup would probably fare worse to be fair though"
<|emo_fear|> I remember writing on them was horrible. Slight delay which threw me off combined with the letters ending up looking like crap. Whiteboard was so much easier.
<|emo_disgust|> Oh hell yeah
<|emo_anger|> Advocating for rape and torture of women on a whole and even inciting men to do it seems like it should break the rules.
<|emo_joy|> I hope you enjoy it!
"<|emo_sad|> Well Happy Birthday from another random stranger on the internet. I spent my birthday mostly alone too, hope your day wasn’t too bad. 💙"
"<|emo_disgust|> Oversleeping always makes me super depressed and even a little nauseous! Even so, I always want to go back to bed."
"<|emo_sad|> This is so sad. [NAME], play 'bitch lasagna'"
"<|emo_joy|> Such a great thing to hear. Setting aside my very immense distaste for SA, this really just makes me happy. I love our country."
"<|emo_sad|> Sadly, yes. You'll only be able to craft weapons with fixed Attachements."
<|emo_sad|> I have a bad one but I also have mild cerebral palsy on my left side
<|emo_anger|> I hate that I like them...
<|emo_fear|> >CFMEU Any excuse to act like thugs and not do any work.
<|emo_surprise|> Yikes hope hes ok
<|emo_disgust|> And that wig is awful
"<|emo_anger|> Yes, you should speak with an attorney."
"<|emo_sad|> Bro we got destroyed last time, we’re due for a heartbreaking missed field goal or extremely ill-timed turnover "
<|emo_disgust|> We're not really meant to be close friends and have sex with someone without feeling anything. You're defying nature by attempting to.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, how did a kid manage to eat a whole watermelon over the space of 47 hours!"
"<|emo_joy|> Thank you! [NAME] is a character that means a lot to me, and it makes me happy that you like my portrayal of her."
"<|emo_fear|> Late-stage Reddit. I'm afraid it's malignant, there are only palliative care options available at this point."
<|emo_disgust|> Sure would hate to explain sodium and water to them as they sprinkle salt on their food.
"<|emo_surprise|> Thank [NAME] , surprising he doesn't want the mets deal"
<|emo_anger|> Drop a link or piss off
"<|emo_anger|> My friend on PS4 said that if you don’t stay to kill the bear, you can’t kill it."
<|emo_disgust|> Sometimes people that are around each other a lot just get to be friends. Sometimes people ignore that their friends are actually terrible people.
<|emo_fear|> Yuuuuuuuuuup. It's horrible.
<|emo_joy|> I’m an NA boy and Rival/Dig were my two favorite orgs. Glad to see at least one of them is returning.
<|emo_sad|> Didn't that used to be the Northern Bank building? Never been troubled by pickpockets in Bangor but probably because I looked too poor!
"<|emo_fear|> Not taking any shit, not being afraid to stick up for themselves or say what they’re thinking. Stomping on eggshells."
"<|emo_disgust|> Usually its better just to ignore the dude whos insane, because you don't know if he has a knife or a gun"
<|emo_disgust|> I had a guy who just kept jumping off the bridge in Eichenwald to his death over and over.. in a placement match.. WHY!
<|emo_sad|> I feel a little sad for her. That she thinks the only options or something to do is having kids. Fuck her tho.
<|emo_joy|> Stotts raising Nurk's usage rate is making me a happy fan
<|emo_joy|> It's time to cultivate some mass.
"<|emo_anger|> I can hear [NAME] now: ""Why don't I have a mic why don't I have a mic FUCK I need a mic"""
<|emo_anger|> Pfft. That's awful of him and her. They deserve each other then. Grab your shite and gtfo. Hope he enjoys his fog and dysfunction.
<|emo_fear|> Yikes. This kind of freaks me out.
<|emo_anger|> GIVE ME OTHER PEOPLES MONEY!!!!!
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry for bringing up so many problems without any solutions, and sorry for just being whiny overall. Thanks for the time you've spent talking with me"
"<|emo_joy|> That’s what I have been doing, I’m glad I’m doing the right thing. Thank you for your kind words."
<|emo_disgust|> I don't think eating 4chan pizza is a good idea. Unless you're into some weird shit.
"<|emo_disgust|> It’s a disgusting mix of mayonnaise, ketchup, and pickle relish."
<|emo_anger|> That’s a lot of damage
<|emo_joy|> This actually made me squeal like a little girl! Thats awesome!!!! Im so happy!
<|emo_joy|> Omg I just finished and I'm in awe...
<|emo_surprise|> The amount of hate that [RELIGION] people get in the world is absolutely staggering.
"<|emo_sad|> Sad, but American"
"<|emo_disgust|> Disgusting trash feminazis, fuck your hijab"
"<|emo_fear|> Sometimes i think i am cringe, but then i see these people and feel a little better"
<|emo_disgust|> This wasn't him forcing her to get an abortion or breast implants dude like seriously you are being pretty ridiculous.
<|emo_joy|> Every time I see this it makes me so happy.
<|emo_sad|> My condolences.
<|emo_disgust|> Lol this pregame about players sucking and getting sent down and then coming back up later and doing better. A giant message to our facebook fans.
<|emo_anger|> That's some bitchy whore
"<|emo_surprise|> > Wonder why centrism was basically nonexistent like a decade ago. Moderates existed even before that, so not really"
<|emo_disgust|> Such a nasty woman
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] fucking dammit
"<|emo_sad|> Was not one of those players, still want to go back to the MW2 days. Totally would if I still had my PS3 :/"
<|emo_anger|> That's some bitchy whore
<|emo_disgust|> Damn. This has to be one of the wrongest predictions ever in this war.
"<|emo_sad|> if the pain doesn't go away after 4 hours or so, it's broke."
<|emo_disgust|> That’s my favorite insult ever
<|emo_joy|> You laugh at them. Openly. For being childish and naive. If they don’t react to facts maybe they’ll react to wounded pride.
<|emo_joy|> You're welcome
"<|emo_joy|> Honestly, it would be even better if she handed the reigns to a brick. Then no deal definitely happens and everyone's happy ever after :D"
<|emo_anger|> he ded.... and why the fuck these POSs have cellphones in prison.
<|emo_sad|> Sounds pretty typical from Toyota really. Been hearing the same story from too many people. Sad really because they were always the best.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you are quite the romantic..."
<|emo_sad|> Then the kids stole my entire house
<|emo_disgust|> Sounds like a great way to accidentally fucking kill someone who might just be passing by.
"<|emo_anger|> *insert [NAME] talnkig about how they will love you but they will hate you, but it's [NAME] instead of [NAME].*"
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] “Good! It’s such a distraction to the team!”
"<|emo_anger|> Dammit, you know I proof read this and I thought it changed correctly but I guess it didn't."
<|emo_anger|> What the Fuck?
<|emo_joy|> Nice! I’m glad you liked it. Have fun exploring :)
<|emo_joy|> Here’s a little update lol so far I’ve had 3 matches today and all of them were “cam models” lmfao
<|emo_fear|> It’s the comment about smelling her that makes it pure cringe.
"<|emo_sad|> Ah, my bad. Always mix em up. Thanks for the correction!"
<|emo_disgust|> Fucking hate [NAME]..
"<|emo_surprise|> I think he means he had an ""a ha"" moment."
"<|emo_joy|>  yay!!! Congratulations! You are so pretty, make up is going to look awesome on you! Your hair is beautiful too ^_^"
<|emo_anger|> That extraterrestrial little grey creatures don’t exist? That’s definitely a fact but I’m very open to any evidence/proof of the contrary lmao.
<|emo_anger|> This fuck needs to sthaaaaap
<|emo_disgust|> Yea he messed around with a 33 year old man dating a 14 year old children. Alabama is one of the main stream media lies.
<|emo_anger|> i like how he just bursts in like DID SOMONE WANA SEE ME ROL OVR !?!
<|emo_joy|> Glad you got her back! Fantastic way to start off the new year with good news!
<|emo_joy|> Went on a date with someone whose 8 years older than me. She didn't realize I was only 20. Whoops.
"<|emo_anger|> Fuck it, im paying the premium -- 15% risk in not getting your money is quite high! "
"<|emo_fear|> I would shoot a cop who shot my animal. Save the consequences for later, you just assaulted and possibly mortally wounded my best friend. ACAB"
<|emo_anger|> If you just slam on the brakes and accommodate these assholes they usually don't even realize they've done anything wrong
<|emo_surprise|> Oi! It was my turn to post that this hour!
"<|emo_fear|> Yeah, without the music that scene would have been much worse."
"<|emo_sad|> Im not a brexiter. In fact, this is my concern with a second referendum. I'm worried that remain will lose."
<|emo_sad|> I'm not a gamer but I always feel bad if I kill an ant or some other bug like that for no reason :( instant regret
"<|emo_joy|> I'm glad it helps, best of luck on your journey. You've gone 7 days clean, keep doing what makes you clean for 84 more!"
<|emo_disgust|> I am he does suck
"<|emo_anger|> Aww, it’s retarded. "
<|emo_sad|> I'm kinda the opposite. I always look dour and sad even when I'm not...
"<|emo_joy|> Yeah, that makes sense, too. (Did it. Once. When I was like 16)"
<|emo_anger|> Because the false accusation makes my anxiety worse
<|emo_joy|> I have a shirt with a picture that is very similar to this
"<|emo_anger|> ""I lost control"" would have been an understandable explanation. ""It lost control"" is not. "
"<|emo_sad|>  anyone who hasn't seen this, it's unbelievably bad."
"<|emo_sad|> ) /sorry, the Excel formula part of my brain was driving me insane."
<|emo_joy|> You're in for a treat- enjoy :)
<|emo_joy|> Wow!!!
<|emo_sad|> And..the reality of it hurts
"<|emo_surprise|> Ah cool, i heard more or less the same story but in Newcastle. "
"<|emo_joy|> Great post, glad you had a good time here. Xpost it to r/travel. "
<|emo_disgust|> It seemed weird to me as well. It's just 10mcg of cyanocobalamin with some fillers like corn starch and celulose.
<|emo_fear|> Everyone in this video is annoying. This seems like a terrible place to go hang out.
"<|emo_anger|> I didn't like this, not for even one second. "
<|emo_sad|> Meanwhile my sister won’t even hug my goodbye when I drop her off at school.
<|emo_surprise|> What the fuck. Got that song on repeat right now
"<|emo_fear|> I had a panic attack when I saw that, thinking that I slept for 3 years and Hall was a Duck."
"<|emo_joy|> Just eat it after. Lol. Im kidding, but it would honestly be the best recycling option. Not that anyone is going to do it. "
<|emo_anger|> You take that back right now! [NAME] does not deserve this.
<|emo_disgust|> They have directly targeted civilians. It's disgusting.
<|emo_disgust|> Lmao doesn’t even try to refute.
"<|emo_anger|> You can’t change my mind about the officiating, I know what I’ve seen"
<|emo_anger|> Worst radio ever.
<|emo_anger|> She doesn't hate him much if she just kept letting him get away with his racket.
"<|emo_fear|> Matinee games always scare me, but I have confidence in this team. LGI!"
"<|emo_disgust|> No, this is not polyamory. It's assholery."
<|emo_surprise|> So. Much. *Effort.* I ca't believe a tree died for this sin.
<|emo_disgust|> This stressed me out
"<|emo_disgust|> If it's Fttn, then not much, maybe worse, because it's still using that shitty old rusted copper running through that same old leaky pit"
<|emo_sad|> The fact half the level has no fucking music is a real pain.
<|emo_sad|> Shock collars are horrible. They poor pup. 😫
<|emo_joy|> Weird how they shoehorned s character from an ongoing tv show into Celebrity Big Brothter. Glad they got rid of him after one episode though.
<|emo_anger|> Fuck shit bitch
<|emo_joy|> Its great that redditors who bicker over different topics can come together for a laugh
<|emo_sad|> That’s depressing
<|emo_joy|> Happy cake day and happy birthday! I'm sorry your friend bailed on you.
<|emo_anger|> Lol. Build your own or make some tweaks to the printer.
<|emo_joy|> I was wondering if that would be spotted. It is from the movie Split. saw the image on Reddit and immediately thought of lions.
<|emo_surprise|> Is this the same person who pins their art to the streetposts by Taufer park? LOL I love it.
<|emo_joy|> This is the strangest rendition of our national anthem that I’ve ever heard.
"<|emo_sad|> Sadly, that theory is plausible in the lds inc realm of thinking."
<|emo_fear|> Will that's what that poor child was just taught. Some parents have no idea
<|emo_anger|> Yeah that's bullshit and the complete opposite of what you said.
<|emo_joy|> Awesome! Thanks for your reply
"<|emo_joy|> Thanks for the encouragement, it means a lot! Glad you liked it, seeya around 👌"
<|emo_disgust|> Oh. Much less exciting than the edit. We live inside the fungus.
"<|emo_anger|> GG Chicago, [NAME] played out of his damn mind tonight"
"<|emo_anger|> If you're old school like me, you will always hate the Cowpokes more. "
<|emo_surprise|> Wtf Powerhouse Macomb is the gym I go to. I've never seen this dude there.
<|emo_fear|> Reporters shouldn’t be afraid of governments - governments should be afraid of reporters.
"<|emo_sad|> It just so happened that PD, sick kids , and family emergencies all happened to overlap between all my coworkers leaving me all alone. "
"<|emo_disgust|> Thanks, I hate it."
<|emo_sad|> >The ABC’s hard-hitting investigation :/ Such a sad article.
"<|emo_surprise|> It's amazing how people will tell you not to go for something, but then are the same ones who can't go 2 minutes without it."
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is ugly btw
<|emo_disgust|> Yea. That video is garbage.
"<|emo_disgust|> The fact their team is stacked makes me hate them, along with [NAME] being a dirty player. Also they are in our division "
<|emo_sad|> French fried when he should have pizza'd and had a bad time.
<|emo_disgust|> This sounds an awful lot like khorne......
"<|emo_fear|> this, they will find a way. we screwed over my entire street for an hour when I got my new fridge.."
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah, this is always my first thought when I read this kind of stuff, kinda sad to be honest "
<|emo_anger|> This is exactly what happens when these fields are controlled by political ideology and not by a unbiased search of the truth.
<|emo_anger|> That was like a movie the way [NAME] and [NAME] were slaying on the enemy ship with Cobbobles firing canons from their ship.
"<|emo_fear|> I want to go scuba diving so bad, but swimming in anything bigger than a pool terrifies me."
"<|emo_surprise|> oh, you're back? have you gotten help for your paranoia yet?"
<|emo_anger|> Holy shit I’m stupid
<|emo_sad|> I didn’t know I’m sorry
"<|emo_sad|> Sad thing is, I wanted to, but I’m stupidly awkward..."
"<|emo_joy|> Sounds like you got really lucky bro :). Did you ever see the guy again? If so, did he ever bully you again? "
<|emo_sad|> Kinda sad if that's what you got out of the ad lol
<|emo_anger|> Fuck man I didn’t plan on crying in my cube today
<|emo_fear|> Well this is terrifying.
"<|emo_sad|> Lost his legs, what an idiot."
"<|emo_sad|> Whatever you do, don't give your virginity to anyone. You will regret it if you give it up cheaply. "
<|emo_joy|> Once we win week 1 next season this sub will turn around lol
<|emo_anger|> This is bloody disgusting.
<|emo_sad|> In that conversation it was the girl being boring and closed... sometimes it’s not your fault and people feel they’re the ones being awkward
<|emo_anger|> What the hell was that pass. That was magical
"<|emo_sad|> > Still hard Phrasing. O_o Sorry, I couldn't resist."
<|emo_anger|> EMAO fats (Eat my ass off)
<|emo_anger|> You’re hardly qualified to talk.
<|emo_sad|> True. You always gotta be careful. It's pretty sad actually. I feel used and abused.
<|emo_disgust|> natural selection will rape her anyway so...
"<|emo_anger|> This better be a troll because if not, you are the most obnoxious, self centered, asinine person on this face of this planet."
"<|emo_sad|> Ouch, that hurts, would've won without the injury"
"<|emo_disgust|> Ahhh, the old ""if you don't vote the way I do, you're a big dumb idiot"" gambit. "
"<|emo_anger|> We left the church, but it'll probably take awhile for him to unlearn all the bullshit"
"<|emo_disgust|> When are you and dad going to pop out a few baby-mammas for us boys, huh? And that's the *less* disgusting alternative. Blech!"
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah, sadly, looks like this champ will be pretty opressive. "
<|emo_surprise|> Wow what's it like to be so petty? (Fixed)
<|emo_fear|> Maybe check the song title one more time chief. Love the song tho. Also today’s a Scared of the Dark kind of day for me
<|emo_joy|> Happy little lies.
<|emo_disgust|> You have terms where the other person can't hang out with someone of the opposite sex? How is it gaslighting?
"<|emo_joy|> I just draw for the fun of it tbh... But having ""success"" or getting recognition still surely feels nice... Don't give up :)!"
<|emo_sad|> With Everyday passing day without a good signing I feel like we got robbed in this trade
<|emo_disgust|> Actually there were blacks in the SS. Kind of an odd analogy.
<|emo_surprise|> Omg I thought you were paraphrasing. I'm so happy that those were the exact words they said.
<|emo_sad|> The mouthbreathers usually aren't boys but guys between 2-3 times my age. Possibly homeless and very smelly.
"<|emo_anger|> yes, i fucking hate that."
"<|emo_sad|> The Fire are also trash and play their games 45 minutes outside of Chicago. Love you Fire fans, sorry about your ownership and FO. "
"<|emo_joy|> Ah, victory "
<|emo_joy|> Horray for Persona
"<|emo_surprise|> Those splits of Marla's still amaze me! Not only in terms of flexibility, but STRENGTH. Just imagine how heavy that leg is..."
<|emo_fear|> You need HELP!
<|emo_fear|> Highly reccomend it OP Listen i got 74 days cigerette free i couldnt be happier! My next step is quitting the juul which is gonna be rough
<|emo_joy|> these people are holding our country back. Im happy natural selection is taking its course.
<|emo_surprise|> So what you are saying is that you are not a serious guitarist is you use finger guards?
"<|emo_anger|> ""I refuse to argue with anyone born before 1980: They don't even know how to rotate PDFs"" That is exactly how this stupid argument sounds"
<|emo_joy|> that made me cry tears of sadness and joy at the same time.
<|emo_joy|> I was expecting a fun game about dolphins once upon a time...mistakes were made.
"<|emo_anger|> No, I generally feel like slugging them in the head repeatedly with an iron bar. Spitting is just petty. *Let your hatred flow!*"
"<|emo_surprise|> Fox News devoted 42 seconds on [NAME], wow."
<|emo_anger|> Now ask me if I care. It's irritating and stupid.
"<|emo_anger|> Man, [NAME] really turned insane, huh. What a shame, man..."
"<|emo_joy|> Nice, Butt Stallion just chilling in the background"
<|emo_joy|> I would love to jam with you guys but I would need to buy an instrument here :(
"<|emo_joy|> I doubt it, serial killers enjoy killing, the stuff they do afterwards is just the icing on the cake for them. "
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, wow, I didn't know my Dad had a Reddit account."
<|emo_fear|> Absolutely terrible. But wholesome aswell.
<|emo_surprise|> My name is [NAME] too. It's so strange hearing my favorite bravolebs say it on TV.
"<|emo_surprise|> Not very choosing beggars-ish, but definitely entitled parents material. Did she really just say that to you? Cuz you can call her out for verbal assault."
<|emo_anger|> But it's accurate. The other link states he was living in one of the poorest provinces in China. Dude was just an idiot
<|emo_fear|> That is absolutely terrifying to me. Oh my god. The idea that she was trapped as a toddler her entire life is just... wow.
"<|emo_fear|> Chernobyl incident has scared everyone to death about nuclear, I'm curious where we would be if that never occurred."
"<|emo_anger|> What an incredibly well thought out response, totally related to the character and moves that were previously being discussed"
"<|emo_sad|> I was love bombed, then ghosted... and it broke me"

<|emo_anger|> I hate people
"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, life in America is horrifying. Give me a break. "
<|emo_disgust|> Omg I'm so dumb I didn't even think of it like that.
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry to hear that, I have it for ps4 and hardcore dlc servers are still up"
<|emo_sad|> Ouch! I felt that!
<|emo_disgust|> Ohhhhh that couple!
<|emo_anger|> “I hate rich people” - people using website made by rich person on a device made by a rich person.
"<|emo_joy|> I like saying the n-word, it makes me happy"
"<|emo_anger|> Yes, you selfish prick. "
<|emo_sad|> I think not living with him in advance is a big mistake.
"<|emo_sad|> [NAME], my eyes are hurting from how furiously they're rolling in my sockets right now."
<|emo_anger|> This is so infuriating.
<|emo_sad|> Bein' separated just doesn't feel so right.
"<|emo_anger|> Damnit Morty! D'you see wha-rrrgh-t you've done!? We're fucked Morty, the squirrels - they're recruiting dolphins now Morty. "
"<|emo_disgust|> Like women don’t have enough things to be judged on, now everyone is talking about our eyebrows..this is the most ridiculous trend to me. "
<|emo_disgust|> Ouch! My hear sank. Don’t do this to me.
<|emo_disgust|> The like is the worst of the bunch
"<|emo_sad|> Actually feel sorry for her. She has depression and low self esteem, this is not going to make it better."
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME], that fucking sucks."
<|emo_joy|> i love all harper news because i love the shit storm that ensues on here.
<|emo_joy|> CUE THE MUSIC!!!
<|emo_surprise|> OMG... Dad!
"<|emo_sad|> She haven't tried contacting me in 2 years, i guess she lied. Congrats to me, I won the 'miss you more' game. ):"
<|emo_joy|> You're glad Australia was playing politics at a time like this? That's not a vote of confidence in the [NAME].
"<|emo_disgust|> There are assholes who think that these are ""their trails"" and do this sort of thing."
<|emo_joy|> Enjoy it! You have a good one for your first!
<|emo_anger|> Two goals that are directly the fault of the our defense? I feel bad for [NAME]
"<|emo_joy|> As much as I would love this kind of support, I had beef with people over EVERYTHING"
<|emo_sad|> My condolences. Lost my cat Zoey over a year ago. I still miss her like crazy. she was only 3 years old too.
<|emo_disgust|> Looks like he has a history of being an awful human:
<|emo_surprise|> Wonder where all the shit is.
<|emo_fear|> Probably scared they’re gonna get flashed by a camera.
"<|emo_disgust|> *youve doomed us all, evacuate the continent immediately*"
"<|emo_disgust|> The snapchat news feed on the stories page is horrendous, its entirely just celebs, porn and hookup culture shit. "
<|emo_anger|> Holy shit it's almost like the PYD is a organization of Syrian citizens I can't believe he exposed them on that.
<|emo_joy|> We don’t “know” but it was reported he is expected to stay on. Really glad about it
<|emo_sad|> I can't describe how that makes my stomach feel
<|emo_joy|> That blows. Glad you're doing better.
"<|emo_joy|> Yes, we did."
"<|emo_disgust|> Canada here, yup..... gods damned homophobic leftovers."
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is huge fucking liar, but you seem to like him."
<|emo_fear|> This is clearly the world's most dangerous gang
<|emo_joy|> This just gave me strength :)
"<|emo_disgust|> > Because I was a disgracefully gullible, immensely stupid fucking dipshit ~~was~~ *am* FTFY"
<|emo_anger|> You sound angry.
<|emo_joy|> We're in it... and now [NAME] is going to the bench? Gotta good feeling!
"<|emo_anger|> Fuck you, u/SamuelZeign ! Your breath smells funny."
"<|emo_disgust|> If you are as ugly as you say you are, you're already a statistical outlier."
<|emo_anger|> WHO WAS DRAAAAAAGED DOOOOOOOWN BYYY THE STOOOOOONE
<|emo_fear|> I love the way you phrased that. I do believe she is terribly afraid to look inward at herself.
<|emo_disgust|> These disgusting old hags are literally old school flesh-consuming ghouls. Like [NAME] or [NAME].
<|emo_anger|> They start as needy creeps and work their way up to being dangerous.
"<|emo_disgust|> Can't speak for that dude, but I'd say hell yeah they're a hate sub. "
<|emo_sad|> Sadly this is not a new issue for Ukraine. Please take a moment to remember Babi Yar :(
<|emo_disgust|> > It’s generally viewed upon as being one of the worst [NAME] games ever made. No it isn't. Source that claim.
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah, my mom would tell at and hit our family dog. She was a tiny little dog too. :("
<|emo_fear|> Also the fishing has been terrible for a month now. I am about to take the 5 story jump my friends.
<|emo_anger|> Damn... 😑
<|emo_fear|> He's most likely been misinformed
<|emo_joy|> FIDLAR dropped their new album today (yesterday?). It is certainly...different. But I'm enjoying it all the same
<|emo_anger|> Why not touch them? then don't shove people out of lifts. that's hardly civil. just WAIT and let people get off.
"<|emo_anger|> This could be me without medication. My baby won’t sleep unless I hold her right now, it suuuuuuuucks."
"<|emo_joy|> Yes!!!! Great weekend. As others have said, I can now enjoy the rest of the playoffs"
<|emo_anger|> Let's kill and eat them all. That'll stop those damned animals from deforesting my forests
"<|emo_sad|> oh, what an unlucky woman, that mother of his..."
<|emo_joy|> I admit I’ll be fairly happy if we continue to invest in young internationals and sign a $100+ mil free agent every offseason.
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if this is why the universe keeps expanding. Because we're constantly filling it up with new words and new sentences.
"<|emo_disgust|> I reject that [NAME] can't defend. Now his legs being gone, that might ""have legs"" "
<|emo_sad|> I stopped worrying about showing vulnerability years ago but there's still nobody there.
"<|emo_fear|> 2 is washed out, 6 and 10 are too dark. Also imgur showed me a bald naked chimpanzee right after your last picture and I nearly choked. "
<|emo_anger|> This genuinely made me angry. He and his sociopath of a wife deserve each other.
<|emo_fear|> i didnt realize i was avoiding a question. i am afraid to talk to cops to be honest. even my own mother doesnt know what i saw
<|emo_anger|> i curse you
"<|emo_joy|> Wow it looks like we held our own negotiating here, nice to see."
<|emo_anger|> Fuck me daddy
<|emo_sad|> I can see why! I would totally be offended too!
<|emo_joy|> >Any [NAME] who is married will skip her Well just for fun let's talk for a moment. Going to send you a PM.
<|emo_surprise|> Hard to believe we scored like 8 points through the first 6 minutes.
<|emo_joy|> Have fun in the farmer's league.
<|emo_anger|> I don’t fucking care
<|emo_disgust|> But what’s wrong with mayo
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] was such a fun weapon
<|emo_sad|> Sorry to hear that
<|emo_joy|> I fucking love New Years day with the Hawks playing in the Winter Classic
<|emo_surprise|> Wow! Look at that spine shine! You handled her perfectly!
<|emo_fear|> That is absolutely terrifying to me. Oh my god. The idea that she was trapped as a toddler her entire life is just... wow.

"<|emo_joy|> Hard to describe, but I get a more relaxed sleep with cbd."
"<|emo_anger|> My anger, up 50%. "
<|emo_disgust|> I can’t believe you’re comparing drug use to interracial marriage. Racists like you disgust me.
<|emo_joy|> I really want a WW1 [NAME]. It would be amazing.
<|emo_joy|> Don’t worry it will work at some point haha.
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] has broken his brain so bad he’s turning [NAME] into [NAME]

"<|emo_disgust|> Also, the phone is set to another language than the one being spoken, which is a bit weird."
<|emo_disgust|> my little abomination
"<|emo_disgust|> No, she's standing in the water after she pees."
<|emo_joy|> Ha ha ha. That was a good one
<|emo_joy|> This is what I'm currently dealing with and I'm glad I read this. Nice reminder thank you lol.

<|emo_anger|> But also: fuck the daily mail
"<|emo_disgust|> I love democracy, that's why I hate antidemoratic institutions like the EU."
<|emo_surprise|> oh my [NAME]
<|emo_anger|> In what fucking world is this drawing not bad
<|emo_sad|> Sometimes you gotta hate living to love life ya feel?
"<|emo_anger|> The username makes it even better, sucking a dudes toes, who is [NAME]. Man I'm jealous "
<|emo_anger|> Omg... Yeah leave him sooner than later... Abusive men can kill women in the long future.
<|emo_sad|> It wasnt a terrible idea until [NAME] got injured and [NAME] got complacent
<|emo_sad|> I am sorry little one
<|emo_fear|> I live an hour from one but was afraid of driving all the way there and them telling me that I have to order one.

<|emo_sad|> In my few years playing I never knew this ... I feel so lost now
<|emo_anger|> I remember being three years old and feeling mortified and frustrated that my preschool teacher and classmates were freely dancing to ridiculous music.
<|emo_joy|> The line the reviews were not positive made me laugh for some reason.
<|emo_surprise|> Looks like I posted it. Oh no!
"<|emo_anger|> I provoked by breathing too hard. And yes, I hate that. "
"<|emo_anger|> Grown men who decide to call themselves""young loli girl"" probably aren't interested in understanding how rape affects society."
<|emo_fear|> Yeah but you're not anymore I'm afraid.
<|emo_fear|> Oh my [NAME] I saw the rocks below the dog and feared the worst!
<|emo_fear|> No. It’s creepy.

<|emo_anger|> I'd piss right on their floor. Fuck this.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] what the hell is going on at hq

"<|emo_anger|> MOTHERFUCKING FLYING MONKEYS, AHHHHHHHHGHGHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!"
<|emo_anger|> WHAT you guys get this show on Netflix? We certainly do not get it in Canada what is this bullshit

<|emo_anger|> It’s selfish to not want to march with people who believe you’re termites and [NAME] killers?
<|emo_joy|> I love reading anti gentrification comments. Because they always sound so stupid.
<|emo_anger|> #Fuck the cowgirls & iggles
<|emo_anger|> Fucking love my pixel 2 ended up hating every Apple device I owned
<|emo_surprise|> I have a coworker that had a similar problem... turns out she needed surgery to clear out her sinuses. Once she had the surgery things improved significantly.

<|emo_disgust|> That’s beyond disgusting in every way.
<|emo_anger|> FUCKING NORMIES REEEEEEEEE
<|emo_sad|> That's cause [NAME] really got his career ruined by injury.
<|emo_sad|> The fact someone could read your post and literally go and do this saddens me.
<|emo_fear|> Should have just looked at them in disbelief and said what you don't make the police that have to work Christmas day a nice lunch. Lol
<|emo_sad|> Degloved finger...*ouch*. One of the worst types of avulsions.
<|emo_anger|> Everyone makes the NREMT test sound like the devil. It really isn't that bad.
<|emo_disgust|> If this is serious mate it’s not the kind of shit you should be posting on reddit
<|emo_joy|> That's so amazing! I am happy for you both!
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what a hug would feel like a lot too.
<|emo_surprise|> He gives political answers to political questions. He's still interacting with the public unfiltered and I can't imagine any CPC Prime Minister ever doing similar.
<|emo_joy|> I enjoy fixing problems. I think of it as a task that I can achieve. People get to overworked when they set too unreachable goals.
<|emo_anger|> Fucking parking in the middle of the street through the entire strip of Allegheny
<|emo_disgust|> Weird I'm short and have anxiety and depression and somehow I'm not an incel.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow you really can’t handle losing can you?

<|emo_disgust|> Best RB draft pick ever? Sure. Best draft pick ever? No lmao

<|emo_sad|> That's unfortunate for you.
<|emo_anger|> Making DC climate an unapologetic brutality with blistering dry winds and no snow on a typical day.
"<|emo_joy|> I am generally a happy person. If you like to pay millions of dollars to semi-literates to represent your government, it's up to you!"
<|emo_surprise|> Interesting what you said about the crew and better to fly solo than with people who bring you down. I'll remember that.
"<|emo_joy|> Oh, sweet. It's the gaming guy who hasn't uploaded any gaming videos yet! /s (I like him and am just poking fun)"
<|emo_anger|> This joke made me want to walk right out of the Dumbledoor.
<|emo_sad|> So much lost diversity...
<|emo_anger|> “I doubt I’m done writing” Kill me
"<|emo_fear|> so lucky. im afraid to tell my [NAME] gf. :"")"

<|emo_surprise|> oh my good
<|emo_disgust|> You should have noped out of the whole thing the moment the racist with a racist character came into the picture.
<|emo_sad|> Honestly i have no clue. Just got my feelings hurt by the mean things he was saying to nurk and wanted to cyberbully him in response
<|emo_anger|> Every point you make is proven wrong lol. Just stop.
"<|emo_fear|> It's a Falling In Reverse song, which makes it even more terrifying"
<|emo_sad|> My mom used to throw tantrums in public. I wanted to crawl into a hole and die when she'd start.
<|emo_joy|> I laughed. Finally
<|emo_sad|> We are living in a time of lukewarm faith where many will fall away and become deceived.
<|emo_sad|> Hard to digest pills
<|emo_anger|> I really hate this family. Nothing but snake-oil salesmen who's negative influence will reverberate for a new generation of young women who deserve better role models.
<|emo_sad|> Ah well I still feel a bit bad for the parrot but at least he won‘t be harmed :)
<|emo_disgust|> just awful I'm gonna throw a barbeque to get back at them
<|emo_sad|> I feel like this anime will make me cry in the end. Damn even its opening is full of drama. Am I correct in this?
<|emo_anger|> What in the fuck was [NAME] doing there
<|emo_anger|> And whatever other slowness and rootkits etc may come with Epic. I still havent forgotten Sonys bullshit or how resource hogging Origin was
<|emo_fear|> I haven't had class in three years and yet I've literally had this nightmare dozens of times.
"<|emo_disgust|> I'm saying [NAME] is the pretentious one, and that the original commenter's response to him is a perfect mockery of the asshole "
"<|emo_disgust|> It’s almost like a lot of Yankees fans are giants fans, and a lot of pats fans are Sox fans. So. Weird."
<|emo_anger|> In my experience it was just people burning the fuck out of popcorn (possibly to cover up the stench of weed) at 2am
"<|emo_disgust|> She’s so gorgeous, I hate you too."
<|emo_sad|> Thanks for your kind words. They made me tear up a bit.
<|emo_disgust|> This is garbage. No. My garbage has more compositional worth than this. Hipster pepto bismol vomit looking trash.
<|emo_disgust|> What do you mean “call you out on things?” Are you being disrespectful? Disruptive? Unsafe?
<|emo_disgust|> I don’t think we want some sort of incest plot arising here
<|emo_disgust|> So far she seems pretty decent but I'm side-eyeing the hell out of him. His conduct at the restaurant was so bizarre and creepy.
<|emo_sad|> It's really very upsetting to have parents who dismiss this condition.
<|emo_sad|> I feel your pain. Sitting here wallowing in self pity and anger at how I let myself go!
<|emo_fear|> I can't imagine how scary that was for you. What is wrong with people?
"<|emo_sad|> ""We're sorry, all circuits are busy now due [NAME] lost keys, try your call again"""
<|emo_fear|> Great to hear that. Scary few hours for y’all.
<|emo_anger|> Wtf the dude is 29? Seemed like only yesterday he was the most hyped goalie prospect in the world...
"<|emo_surprise|> The intro in that video looks like a sand storm on there, imagine a sand storm while playing GA on that map, it would be awesome!"
"<|emo_sad|> I've had a few blisters from hot welds, but nothing that bad..."
<|emo_sad|> >the satisfaction of knowing how bent out of shape you're getting What a sad existence.
<|emo_anger|> Dude was using his power and leadership to exploit women. This is gross.
<|emo_surprise|> I was there on the opposite side of the field. I did not believe he made that catch until we saw it later on tv. Unreal.
"<|emo_anger|> Okay idiot, well it seems right wingers can't tell the difference between strawman and reality then. Thanks for confirming it douchebag. "
"<|emo_fear|> Laugh all you want, it's pretty much indestructible now!"
<|emo_anger|> What? Shut up?
<|emo_surprise|> Top female players including [NAME] practice against college men players and get beat a lot by them. I wouldn't be suprised to see [NAME] win even at 14..
<|emo_disgust|> That’s rude af. Slay him with your words. Give him every insult in the book then say bye bye
<|emo_sad|> SHE MAKES ME CRINGE :(
<|emo_anger|> The players turning on him for crying story cracked me up though.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow i didn't really expect both the explosion and him to live
<|emo_fear|> It wasnt a terrible idea until [NAME] got injured and [NAME] got complacent
<|emo_anger|> I'm [NAME] and I'll leave you with what we all came here to see ... [NAME]!
<|emo_anger|> You should've smashed his head into it.
<|emo_sad|> Harry's appears to actually be worse. Check out their charity choices.
<|emo_disgust|> What's there to disagree on..... it's pretty apparent
"<|emo_joy|> Oooh I see! Oh god yes, [NAME] is one of the best things about England. I also quite like [NAME], for my sins!"
<|emo_joy|> Happy cake day :)
"<|emo_surprise|> What? No deal, abort, abort!"
"<|emo_anger|> WE'RE ON OUR WAY WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO BAKU, WE'RE ON OUR WAY!"
"<|emo_surprise|> Omg actually?! I mean no judgment , I am just SHOOK "
"<|emo_sad|> ahah I hadn't even thought of it until the scenario I mentioned above, so dont feel too bad."
"<|emo_surprise|> The baby photos, holy fucking shit there's so many baby photos now."
"<|emo_joy|> I'm a woman, 50-adjacent, and a descendant of slaves. I like hot sauce but I hate [NAME]."
<|emo_surprise|> Omg this is repulsive
<|emo_disgust|> Makes it even weirder that she now hates America
<|emo_joy|> If you like that I got one that you may like. makes me laugh everytime here
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Forget the separation, lawyer up and go straight to divorce. "
<|emo_sad|> This hurts me.
<|emo_disgust|> The ones who agree with her are the only ones who actually address *her* issue....which is how to deal with boundary stomping relatives.
<|emo_sad|> I miss [NAME]
<|emo_fear|> That hop/shuffle is scary
"<|emo_disgust|> The US and Canada are great allies, it's really a shame they've elected their worst. "
<|emo_sad|> It's more like depression is the default state. We live in a depressing society.
"<|emo_joy|> No problem, glad to help."
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME]. Yesssss.
<|emo_joy|> happy new year buddy!
<|emo_surprise|> I can’t believe you’re comparing drug use to interracial marriage. Racists like you disgust me.
<|emo_anger|> Man I hate that [NAME] guy.
<|emo_sad|> Sounds pretty typical from Toyota really. Been hearing the same story from too many people. Sad really because they were always the best.
<|emo_joy|> I haven't heard that name in SO LONG. They had this GBA game that was one of my favorite games of all time!
<|emo_joy|> If you’re going to be a psycho you might as well smile and make it look like you’re a happy one.
"<|emo_fear|> Oh god, [NAME] is terrible. My kid loves it though, and Dr [NAME]"
<|emo_joy|> He's been cheered for years now.
<|emo_joy|> I was wondering if that would happen. The story I first read was crazy.
<|emo_joy|> Because you deserve to live and be happy
<|emo_anger|> please stop pointing your fingers in my face
<|emo_fear|> Everyone makes the NREMT test sound like the devil. It really isn't that bad.
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] dude I’m sorry. That’s their problem now. Bump some [NAME] and keep moving forward.
<|emo_joy|> This type of discussion is exactly what I came to r/medicine for. Thanks guys!
"<|emo_sad|> Damn, she was gonna clobber that punk with the butt of that gun."
<|emo_sad|> This makes my tummy sick.
<|emo_joy|> What a steal that was
<|emo_joy|> another one of those chicks sacrificing her children for a man and 'happiness'
<|emo_disgust|> We’re not upset. We’re disgusted. You’re disgusting.
<|emo_surprise|> I’m blown away by how many people know this.
"<|emo_joy|> I blame all of y'all, y'all told [him he] was funny"
<|emo_anger|> Every. Single. Time.
<|emo_fear|> HHahah. Right? I’m scared
"<|emo_joy|> Just hit my 3pl8 squat, been looking forward to this for a long time so really happy I finally got it! Now on to 4"
<|emo_anger|> This draft is one man deep tbh. Not getting Zion would be devastating and a waste of a whole year.
"<|emo_joy|> Congrats! Enjoy a free slice, I think you know what to do with this 🍕"
<|emo_sad|> It's so focused on the presenter and he is so unengaging it's painful.
<|emo_anger|> My meme coins are starting to hit the 70% growth range from the beginning of the month. I'm feeling bullish.
<|emo_disgust|> This comment killed me. RIP in pieces.
<|emo_sad|> Poor [NAME] doesn't deserve that!
<|emo_disgust|> shucci a lil BITCH
<|emo_disgust|> At least you should have helped out since you had rudely interrupted him.
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]? Is that you?
<|emo_surprise|> Can you imagine the amount of backlash she’d get if it was ANOTHER [NAME] collab? Omg.
<|emo_joy|> It’s saved in the cloud now lol
<|emo_sad|> Well that’s sad. It might’ve been funny if it was fake.
<|emo_anger|> “You have no clue what fascism is” Goes on to promote literal genocide tactics. You’re despicable
"<|emo_anger|> No, we both know you are liar. Thanks for convincing me to block you."
<|emo_disgust|> Who would have thought people were going to be using the Padres for their fake news to generate clicks. This is nuts.
"<|emo_sad|> He was cut yesterday, unfortunately"
"<|emo_anger|> > [NAME] mother allegedly vandalized [NAME] grave, stating that she had ruined her son's life. No...."
"<|emo_fear|> The one coach I didn't want to lose, but with a new offense coming in, not a move i'm entirely shocked by. "
<|emo_joy|> I was about to lose my shit but then I finally found the Plumbus
<|emo_sad|> Ouch. That hurt the ego. And that’s not easy to do.
<|emo_anger|> PARENTS: VACCINATE YOUR FUCKING KIDS OR THE NEXT NAP THEY TAKE WILL BE IN A COFFIN OMFG
<|emo_joy|> Funny I’m on my second play through and this happens...
"<|emo_anger|> If someone has tithed 10% their entire life, fuck off with requests like this."
<|emo_anger|> Makes it even weirder that she now hates America
<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is supee trashy. How did it get to front page?
<|emo_sad|> Crying? Yeah i like crying C-calling R-out Y-for I-serious N-mental G-treatment
<|emo_anger|> What a shit twat
"<|emo_joy|> Im glad I am able to help others, even if its just yourself. Stay strong and look after yourself. You can do this 💪"
"<|emo_disgust|> Good point, it’s nice and frustrating for both sides I see. Definitely worse for the lower levels. That’s too bad"
<|emo_joy|> Left beer outside so I could make a cool picture for reddit. Please give karma.
"<|emo_joy|> Sure glad I wasn't coming the other way when this twatwaffle decided to try his ""watch this sick drift, yo"" stunt."
<|emo_anger|> Fuck the cubs
<|emo_anger|> What an ass. I almost downvoted this out of anger.
<|emo_sad|> I did not know those were a thing. I need to get one for my pain meds.
<|emo_fear|> Reporters shouldn’t be afraid of governments - governments should be afraid of reporters.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that's clunky."
<|emo_joy|> I can when enough time has passed. I've got each of their playoff games from that year and it's fun to relive it during the offseason.
<|emo_surprise|> It was magic.
<|emo_disgust|> Worst deal on the leafs right now easily
<|emo_sad|> Just keep going and don't lose hope. Stuff like this can happen all the time to anybody. It's just bad luck
<|emo_anger|> “Don’t discipline my kid!”
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME]: ""I like being bad. It makes me happy."""
<|emo_anger|> The orange man angers me and I do not like him.
<|emo_anger|> Let them argue. We've never done anything remotely as bad as MOST OF THE WORLD does routinely.
"<|emo_anger|> It’s shame that despite the years of dedication, persistence, and hard work. His efforts are reduced because of his height."
<|emo_joy|> Poor fella just got his arms out of plaster and we’re already making fun of him
"<|emo_joy|> The possibilities are fascinating. In other times, I'd be enjoying watching the lawyers argue...!"
"<|emo_sad|> The smile on these guys face, the will and passion to explore all gone in a second. Rest in peace explorers!"
<|emo_joy|> Nope. Mac fix+ matte and Body Shop mattifying tea tree spray are the only ones that help my makeup.
<|emo_surprise|> I'm speechless.
<|emo_joy|> Oh haha I’m from liberal MA and started having sex younger. I come from a sex positive environment.
"<|emo_anger|> Honestly, this has got to be the most reckless way to bully and harass a kid. Kids have a tendency to grow to their expectations"
<|emo_surprise|> How strange is it that it is only gun control enthusiasts think that compromise means one side gets what it wants and the other side only loses.
<|emo_anger|> same but with cats. Puppies are really high maintenance and make me angry when i have to take care of them.
<|emo_joy|> This is the sweetest.
<|emo_anger|> You forgot about the [NAME] congresswoman.
"<|emo_joy|> Hey. As long as the person I help is better off than when I first saw them, I’m happy."
"<|emo_fear|> Wow. AP should find that video and flag whoever did that...deep, scary issues at play"
<|emo_disgust|> This is absolutely the stupidest mock I've seen this year
<|emo_surprise|> You guys really took this loss well. I'm stunned at how not-salty you minor leaguers are taking it. Totally not full of excuses and what-ifs.
"<|emo_joy|> I love reading positive stories!! Happy for you, OP!"
<|emo_disgust|> Both parents were drunk. Where were the small children? You helped her cheat and possibly contribute to child neglect. Awesome.
"<|emo_anger|> You're definitly an asshole, or a troll. Maybe both."
<|emo_fear|> His smile is so damn creepy
<|emo_joy|> I love those possum dives!
"<|emo_fear|> The constant pressure definitely isn't helping. I'm already on anti-depressants, but I am terrified of PPD."
<|emo_anger|> How am I arguing? I thought it was pretty clear I'm asking how something works in what I presume is a different county.
"<|emo_joy|> Agree 100% I guess I'm just happy to see anyone, even total scumbags, willing to criticize dear leader. "
<|emo_sad|> Sorry man I don’t really like duck.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh god I thought he career was long over
<|emo_disgust|> Because our roster has gotten worse each year since 2017 and the team is spending less. That isn't a recipe for continued success
<|emo_disgust|> Fcuk you.
<|emo_surprise|> Omgg yes [NAME] precious
<|emo_disgust|> I watched a video about fake makeup having rat piss in it. No thank you
<|emo_joy|> You sound fun at parties
<|emo_fear|> I need therapy but I’m too scared to go to therapy.
<|emo_joy|> You were used as a weapon to inflict pain on your father. Glad you reconnected and found a good parent.
<|emo_anger|> And if you ever make a fat cop joke on reddit then you're the worst criminal of all!
"<|emo_anger|> fuck these dysfunctional, insecure mattresses"
"<|emo_anger|> I'd hardly call them innocent if they're reveling in the thought of more mass shootings. People like that deserve worse, quite frankly."
"<|emo_disgust|> Well, there goes my lunch. This is somehow even worse than mine."
<|emo_sad|> I’m sorry to hear you’ve been cheated on.. but you’re free ! Makes it easier for NC if they found a new FP
<|emo_joy|> [NAME]! Scoring ridiculous goals while missing sitters. Love it :-)
<|emo_anger|> all I did was snitch on him
<|emo_surprise|> Right? He actually came across as level headed and mature here so that was a shock.
"<|emo_disgust|> I actually see this one a lot. ""Allergy: fire ants."" Me too, bro. Ants will fuck you up."
<|emo_anger|> Fun ruiner.
"<|emo_surprise|> Considering you are also a child, I can't say I'm surprised by your edgy hot take."
<|emo_anger|> I second that motion...with A VENGEANCE!!
"<|emo_fear|> Watched Split. Good but got a little spooked. Unbreakable last night, Glass tomorrow hopefully"
<|emo_fear|> I interview applicants and respect people that ask about work life balance and harassment policy... are applicants afraid of asking these questions?
<|emo_joy|> We got heated toilet seats here in Japan. Big smiles.
"<|emo_anger|> Please stop posting things like this, this is serious, keep it civil, keep it real, thanks."
"<|emo_joy|> Oh, I think I misread it somewhere. Good news then! Hope [NAME] will use him next season. L"
"<|emo_sad|> and i answered, sorry if you can't follow. i agree that having a pet involves (unnecessarily) having power over a small animal. "
<|emo_sad|> Uh...no
"<|emo_disgust|>  Calm down and relax are the worst things to say to a woman, ever. "
<|emo_joy|> Glad you liked it!
"<|emo_disgust|> I just dropped out of my science class without being at school, hot damn"
<|emo_disgust|> How dare they not have the foresight to realize he'll become a president we don't like decades later.
"<|emo_surprise|> I was honestly shocked when they denied an overpayment, especially since after the charges cleared it would have been a $0 balance."
<|emo_sad|> Yep. Seriously painful to read
<|emo_fear|> OMG what??? ...[NAME] actually showed up for a gig without cancelling with a terrible excuse?
<|emo_fear|> I got bit by a Pomeranian while doing a dash...
<|emo_joy|> LOL at the tldr. What a crazy story. I'm glad the writer got some friendly new relatives out of it.
<|emo_joy|> I'm so glad you weren't physically hurt
<|emo_sad|> Please [NAME] that’s how I want to go!
"<|emo_anger|> No, everyone should should stop talking about the rights of groups of people, and start talking about *human* rights."
<|emo_joy|> This makes me smile!
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] damn I wish you was located near me haha
<|emo_sad|> When my [NAME] is crying...
<|emo_disgust|> This isn’t unpopular. Like 1 in 15 people actually think this... go say this shit in another sub
<|emo_joy|> Everyone clapped too btw
<|emo_fear|> Because they fear for their lives...
<|emo_anger|> Very frustrating. And totally the fault of your school’s systems for handling the issue. Sorry you have to deal with it.
<|emo_sad|> The saddest thing about this is that most people truly in need are the last ones to ask for help because they don't want to be anyones burden...

"<|emo_sad|> Pretty much, it’s ironic to think how quickly the parties would switch positions if the illegal immigrants were expected to vote 90% for [NAME]."
"<|emo_surprise|> This is a person who has clearly danced a lot, I wonder what happened "
"<|emo_disgust|> You're right, laws don't stop people from committing crimes, we might as well legalize murder. You people sound like retards."

<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised [NAME] hasn't had a chance to be called up
<|emo_sad|> > Killing an intruder in your home in self defense is now a really bad thing. That was not even under discussion.
"<|emo_sad|> Come on, at least give me one other comment not from this thread. Show me that you are at least interested in providing an argument. "
<|emo_joy|> This is the cutest! Wearing your heart on your sleeve so to speak.
<|emo_anger|> You're mistaking a poor character for MC.
"<|emo_anger|> And losing to division rivals gives them the tie breaker, no? Very frustrating. "
<|emo_disgust|> Theres nothing more despicable in this world than a carelessly brewed mug of chai brother. You gotta get with the program.
"<|emo_fear|> [NAME] is getting frustrated and [NAME] is playing well, not much between the two last few points. Finishing it off is going to be a challenge for [NAME]"

<|emo_joy|> My blood pressure Edit: I'm just happy to be here.
<|emo_joy|> That beat slaps. Good memories
<|emo_surprise|> She sounds jealous of [NAME]. Sounds like she’s never had a decent relationship so that’s probably why she’s sabotaging her daughters relationship.

"<|emo_joy|> I like it, especially the shovel and therapy lines"
"<|emo_joy|> Man I am so happy for [NAME], they are selling out. Personally there is no way I would be able to afford them for 38$"

"<|emo_surprise|> Wow your sister is in abusive relationship, cool. "
"<|emo_joy|> I had a similar problem. Turned out to be technology, and overstimulation. Turned off the screens before dinner and had much better sleep."
<|emo_fear|> Thank you so much for this advice :) i'm just really worried about going through the process again
<|emo_anger|> Looks like emotionally and physically beating the shit out of his wife and children was not wasted then.
<|emo_disgust|> Oh noooo. I once accidentally rubbed my eye after handling habaneros. It's the worst.
"<|emo_anger|> Don't you have a cashier to hassle somewhere? Go find something without a price tag and then tell them ""I guess it's free!"""

<|emo_surprise|> He is in [NAME] team. He bend a knee and give up the North because fall in love with her. As script said.
<|emo_anger|> Yeah how dare the puck not magnetize to [NAME] stick. Not his fault at all.
<|emo_disgust|> This country is an absolute shithole. Our police are no better than the filth they should be catching!
<|emo_joy|> Originated joke by:
"<|emo_joy|> Well, at least you'll have plenty of company"
"<|emo_joy|> And he even dared to reference fairly odd parents in there, wtf lol"
<|emo_sad|> Or you could learn to reverse park and stop whining. It’s a lot easier to park backwards.
<|emo_anger|> Just piss off
<|emo_fear|> I’m shaking rn
<|emo_sad|> ....it’s just raining on my face
<|emo_joy|> Wish I was this happy
<|emo_surprise|> Are 3% of [NAME] really vegan?? That’s fantastic!
<|emo_joy|> If Android: YouTube Vanced is your new best friend. If IOS: sorry lol get a real phone
"<|emo_sad|> Ouch, that hurts, would've won without the injury"
<|emo_fear|> It's horrible and I love it and you should be proud.
<|emo_disgust|> regret unfollowing him...
<|emo_joy|> YUP. I’ve been healthier since the new year FINALLY smh
<|emo_anger|> How DARE you!

<|emo_fear|> That’s what I’m terrified of.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh. This woman who died also had a son who died. Holy tragedy
<|emo_anger|> This happened to me in the same hour of the discard! Went from shouting to supportive friend within 45 mins.
<|emo_joy|> Yeah [NAME] is actually really cute and nice but best boi and best girl goes to [NAME] and [NAME]. Just kidding. [NAME] all the way
<|emo_sad|> You're gonna die tomorrow.
<|emo_surprise|> He gets paid to hate them... what's hard to understand?
"<|emo_anger|> Fuck those people, there's no point thinking about them"
"<|emo_fear|> The one thing I worry about is that the 9-5 ""window"" is keeping employers from demanding workers be on-call 24/7. "
<|emo_joy|> Gods speed brother.
<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised everyone seems to think there will be a season 2.
<|emo_anger|> You just defended him with a bunch of doublespeak bullshit so I’m gonna have to disagree. You’re a fucking idiot.
"<|emo_anger|> Well, there goes my lunch. This is somehow even worse than mine."
<|emo_surprise|> That actually gave me goosebumps. This is all the communication we need.
<|emo_joy|> Thanks! We had fun.
<|emo_anger|> Hulu is awful for this. The volume on their commercials is deafening.
"<|emo_disgust|> I have never gone from almost brushing off something to darn near vomiting because of it, good lord."
<|emo_anger|> Them boys smelling even more blood in the water. Rack them fuckin points up boys!
<|emo_sad|> These people have absolutely no confidence in their ability to make a living. It’s pathetic.
<|emo_disgust|> I wishhhh. She’s honestly what started getting me the fuck away from centrism
<|emo_joy|> Happy little lies.
<|emo_sad|> Any man who risks having unprotected intercourse with random women likely doesn't have being a father on his mind.
"<|emo_anger|> The wage, you Fucking troll. But you don't care do you? See your post history."
<|emo_sad|> This hurts to hear because we know it's true. There are 16 year olds who have experienced more than me.
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is on fire!!!
<|emo_surprise|> How do you plan on taking care of 2 infants at the age of 18? What about the third one?
<|emo_joy|> a romantic one :)
<|emo_anger|> They just shot up a mall. They’re complete fucking idiots.
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] these things were terrible. i presume they still are. #teamlemoncreams
"<|emo_anger|> You shouldn't have been leaving anyway, witch. Go write a funding bill. You know... do your job."
"<|emo_joy|> Come on, be nice to our resident libertarian to alt right pipeline example"
<|emo_joy|> All good brother
<|emo_joy|> It just feels nice to share uplifting energy with people.
<|emo_anger|> Only a sith deals in absolutes.Fuck that guy.
"<|emo_fear|> I am afraid to look, but my morbid curiosity draws me to ask."
<|emo_sad|> Reading this made me clutch my nipples in pain
"<|emo_anger|> I couldn't be a god, I hate harp music."
"<|emo_joy|> Thank you so much for this link, watching [NAME] was an absolute delight! "
<|emo_joy|> I just wanna use all those fancy shields I keep yanking out of hoplites' hands.
"<|emo_surprise|> **GOD DAMN YOU, FIGHT BACK!!**"
"<|emo_joy|> That's just the adrenaline. It'll set in soon, haha"
<|emo_sad|> The must be on the prowl because I've been getting these calls a lot lately.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow calm down
"<|emo_joy|> I'm very glad too. She has been with me for twenty years now, so basically all my life."
<|emo_anger|> “Your” people are mentally ill and need help. Go get it ASAP!
<|emo_sad|> You'll miss a begging old man asking for a spare coin. RIP
<|emo_joy|> ...and life can be very good when you free yourself from that fear!
"<|emo_disgust|> My bad, I guess I should've read the whole thing, from opiate yes "
<|emo_surprise|> Honestly took me by surprised. Good job!
"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah, and there's no better way to make a market more competitive than to regulate it more..."
"<|emo_sad|> Because I felt like it, just as you felt like announcing you basic grooming while trying to be insulting. 🙄😏🤷‍♀️"
"<|emo_disgust|> I loathe him too, but I couldn't even get on board with lynching him. Not even that obnoxious twat [NAME]"
<|emo_sad|> So sorry for your loss! I lost my cat 6 years ago in 2021 due to terminal autism. 😭😭
<|emo_joy|> This guy likes his town - except for the pig blood processing
<|emo_disgust|> What in the fuck? Now is garbage!
<|emo_fear|> I love how this boxy things is made to scare (common every show use that joke) but the queens is not scare at all.
<|emo_sad|> Sorry this shit is happening to you. Thanks for capturing the first [NAME] in WWII. Go Coast Guard.
"<|emo_sad|> Oh my gosh, my Dodger blue heart goes out to yours and your family. I am so sorry."
<|emo_disgust|> As long as he knows [NAME] won’t take his shit lol
<|emo_anger|> She's aggressive in every TLJ fight. She even bullied that poor homeless man.
<|emo_disgust|> tobaccy is nasty
<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Have that much debit in your bovada account is something crazy. Props to you
<|emo_joy|> I’m very happy for you! Congrats! 😁
<|emo_disgust|> Ugh...terrible.
<|emo_joy|> California Adventure has beer so I'm fuckin living the dream.
<|emo_joy|> Wow! You must have pretty low standards for teachers in your state/school! I guess that's why Massachusetts is always first for education.
"<|emo_joy|> Gotta love these kids! When they do or say the cutest things like that, it really makes u melt....... Enjoy OP!!!"
<|emo_sad|> The fact that big corporations that made their successes off capitalism are embracing Marxism is really disturbing.
<|emo_joy|> Lol you sweet summer child. I wish I weren't so cynical and had hope like this.
<|emo_disgust|> It doesn’t surprise me given that this is the kind of establishment where staff rape the coma patients.
"<|emo_sad|> Jeter been enjoying the Miami nightlife a little too much maybe, dulled his senses. "
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] ran out of her way to butt into the conversation with [NAME] and [NAME]. [NAME] . I can't stand [NAME]
<|emo_surprise|> omg you like totally caught me!!! i'm just a silly social media girl named [NAME]
<|emo_fear|> I graduated in 2002 and had history books that ended with [NAME] 2nd term. I had great teachers but terrible materials.
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] ain't all that. Sorry.
<|emo_joy|> This caught me off guard for real. I actually off my bed laughing. +1
<|emo_sad|> Poor [NAME] she just broke her back
<|emo_sad|> Please post any news you may find about her fate. This is so sad and so wrong. We need to know what happens to her.
<|emo_fear|> Please don’t murder me
<|emo_joy|> Thank u!!! Im gonna try this one bless u
<|emo_joy|> Glad she's not living in a bubble then....
<|emo_sad|> That's terrible. I'm sorry for your loss.
<|emo_joy|> That should be fun. I may have call in sick tomorrow. Lots of Bournemouth fans including my boss.
<|emo_disgust|> They blew him? That's a hell of a deleted scene....
<|emo_disgust|> You remember this sub on the month of release? it was an absolute shitstorm
"<|emo_sad|> I love it. This made me smile so much, which is a big change from [NAME] which made me cry and further increase my depression."
<|emo_sad|> That really is all they have. He’ll just keep asking questions in bad faith to continue getting your attention.
<|emo_fear|> Best of luck. Don't be afraid to come back if you want specific talking points if you get stuck. And take care!
<|emo_disgust|> Really? Down voted for thinking picking up the phone in the middle of sex is crappy?
"<|emo_disgust|> Same here man, terrible feeling"
<|emo_fear|> I genuinely think that would be an iconic shot if it was in a famous horror film. The way the legs just keep on coming is terrifying.
<|emo_fear|> The biggest Nightmare
"<|emo_joy|> No worries, good luck!"
"<|emo_sad|> Please, you deserve life, you know it deep down inside "
<|emo_fear|> The secondhand panic and embarrassment I feel from this is astounding
<|emo_joy|> Well it was just an educated shot in the dark but glad to help 😊
<|emo_anger|> Nothing of value lost then. They didn't really give a shit before so it doesn't matter now. Move on and cultivate new relationships.
<|emo_anger|> >are you guys ignoring us international fish viewers Yes Shut up
<|emo_sad|> Looks sick actually.
<|emo_surprise|> 1200? I thought it was 12000! Ohhhhhhh. Dr. Now’s not going to be too happy with my weigh-in dis munt.
<|emo_fear|> A majority of the season they’ve been able to win out in ugly games. I just think that warriors loss left a bit of a scar
<|emo_joy|> Makes me very happy indeed.
<|emo_joy|> Tournament was a blast met some really cool people loved it all. Thanks for holding it. Would love to do it again someday
<|emo_disgust|> Middle school. Puberty was rough for most of us. I was a victim and a perpetrator of a lot of stupid behavior in middle school.
"<|emo_joy|> Ah that's my school but I have yet to see this one, gotta keep swippin "
<|emo_sad|> Now I’m crying before work thanks a lot 😭
"<|emo_joy|> Ace here! I do masturbate and enjoy it, I just feel no sexual attraction or desire to have sex with other people."
<|emo_sad|> I'm so sad.
"<|emo_fear|> Yeah, I was thinking my boy was into them before that. But I doubt Panic! At the Disco would have peaked his interest."
<|emo_joy|> While living in Japan? Never say never... but it is very hard to imagine.
<|emo_surprise|> that's an adventure!
"<|emo_anger|> For the people and finding out how they end up? Sure. Other than that, it’s not great. Frustrating at best. "
"<|emo_surprise|> yea he had 6 assists which created 13 points, if he had 13 points and no assists people would be calling it a great game for him"
<|emo_fear|> that's horrifying
"<|emo_disgust|> What a manipulative, child of a man. Jeez, grow up."
<|emo_joy|> A thousand times this! I just found some of my old childhood stuff from the 80s with a 2 bar and it is fucking awesome.
<|emo_disgust|> That partially explains why season 4 was such a fucking mess
<|emo_joy|> I mean I’m playing a card game and enjoying the cheap cards
"<|emo_sad|> Not the snowbank, though. That will end badly in spring."
<|emo_fear|> Bad execution but it made me smile through the cringe. The sentiment is definitely relatable.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, whereabouts in Croydon are you it wasn't this bad where I am! "
<|emo_joy|> Happy one week anniversary
<|emo_surprise|> hahaha. I was/am honestly surprised that is the only time I've heard of a parent calling a rapid.
<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe he told that story. I'm sure the minister that released the water is now so totally regretting not asking for a bj!
<|emo_surprise|> Someone that can check your dash and aa your jump is frightening.
<|emo_sad|> I HAVE EYE PROBLEMS NOW IM REALLY YELLING
<|emo_joy|> So we're the 2nd richest team.
"<|emo_disgust|> Delightfully devilish, [NAME]. "
"<|emo_joy|> Man I'm sad, he was my favorite [NAME] when he left ([NAME] heir apparent) and I was ecstatic when he returned"
<|emo_sad|> 🎵 *The waiting is the hardest part.* 🎵
<|emo_surprise|> wow! trust issues.
<|emo_joy|> It’s like bombs over Baghdad to a whole new level... I LOVE IT!!
<|emo_anger|> I think it it would have been even worse if that was the case
<|emo_joy|> I'm sorry you had to go through that. Though I'm glad you're out of that toxic environment now.
"<|emo_anger|> Reject your humanity voluntarily and put the pure hatred, lack of moral, sociopathy and sadistic altitude inside of your soul with no way to turn back."
<|emo_disgust|> It's weird because sometimes I care and sometimes I don't. Although I wouldn't call myself an asexual I could be leaning more towards demisexual.
<|emo_anger|> Stupid science bitch
<|emo_joy|> Hey bro there’s no judging here
<|emo_anger|> Just do it!
<|emo_anger|> Hang on is that allowed? Geez that guy seemed really angry.
<|emo_anger|> Lets fuckin do this
"<|emo_sad|> Also, he never gets hurt so you can't Robidas the guy. "
<|emo_sad|> I used to do the same exact thing! Now I love the fat on my steak and watching them cut it off in japanese restaurants makes me sad.
"<|emo_surprise|> Hey it's been 2 weeks, are your friends still stuck at 60-ish ranks, just gathering info on MM and such."
"<|emo_sad|> I'd rather take the chance that a kind, helpful comment falls on deaf ears than a snide one ends up hurting someone. "
"<|emo_disgust|> I've pulled a long, curly black hair out of my mouth while eating a meal once... I'm a man with very short blonde hair. 🤢"
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME] IS SO HAPPY AND SO AM I!! Edit: [NAME] I see you, relax"
<|emo_sad|> Competitive Deathmatch was a huge reaper fest last season :( Had many games where everyone was reaper except maybe two people
"<|emo_fear|> I have been saying this for a long time, he is way overpaid and the forward position is our main weakness since [NAME] left. "
"<|emo_fear|> Acestream is a great tool, just a shame that it's closed source, makes it a bit scarier for me to use."
<|emo_anger|> You fool you're using logic on a show that is clearly not bound by any
"<|emo_joy|> Glad to hear it’s open again, great spot. I still class climbing Coonowrin as the stupidest thing I’ve ever done."
<|emo_anger|> R/T DIDN'T WANT IT!!!!
<|emo_disgust|> i love the crocheted romper look and i don't care if i'm wrong
"<|emo_anger|> She really does and She really isn't! She's an old, tired ass, busted up, con artist hoe!"
<|emo_anger|> Shhh don't give them the idea!
<|emo_anger|> What The actual fuck
<|emo_joy|> UPDATE i got a set of spare keys finally and rescued my dogs. theyre happy happy and being spoiled with treats. I APPRECIATE YOU ALL
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] just ripped his jersey. He’s frustrated as hell right now
<|emo_anger|> Same thing with Urgot mid. It looks absolutely trash even in LCK.
"<|emo_disgust|> Please get your soy away from me, i’m allergic."
<|emo_anger|> Fuck Liberty Counsel. They are a hate group.
<|emo_sad|> Bad luck you’re in Beckton
<|emo_disgust|> A crappy situation... Man oh man...
<|emo_sad|> I wanna die I don't wanna live anymore I really wanna die so bad Please return me to the dark abyss I long for death’s sweet kiss
<|emo_anger|> How are you 100% positive that you're pregnant if you haven't taken a test yet?
<|emo_sad|> FUCKACTIVISION THEY RUIN EVERYTHING
<|emo_joy|> Glad to hear it's ubiquitous and not an OS thing.
"<|emo_anger|> Go your own way, loser. "
"<|emo_surprise|> On top of the animals listed, you can also unfortunately see foxes in Oatley Park closer to sunset."
<|emo_sad|> Because this is a poorly run franchise. This is a bad team.
"<|emo_anger|> I made one comment, and you came in to call it childish..... like, what else are you doing besides badgering?"
"<|emo_joy|> I’ll be honest I really don’t care. I’m happy to know that others care about this, but eh you do you"
<|emo_surprise|> Wow talk about strength!
"<|emo_surprise|> Whoa, we need animal safe verbiage! Don't feed a fed horse."
"<|emo_anger|> Irrelevant what is deserved, as if that's objective. The only thing that matters are the facts and they don't support a move like this."
<|emo_fear|> I use one every time I park and you just replied to me. so this is a bit awkward.
"<|emo_sad|> I think that’s best, but it tough while living together and trying to keep a smile on for the kids. "
<|emo_disgust|> I mean everyone already knows what u like so its gonna be weird
<|emo_anger|> Exactly. My father is part of Homeland security and is furloughed. Homeland Security isn't completely shut down but they furloughed part of their work force.
<|emo_fear|> That's what this seems to be saying unless something was lost in translation
<|emo_joy|> Glad your nights going well guys
<|emo_disgust|> You people are awful. Those are *Haggisus Australis*. They're a protected species!
<|emo_joy|> Ayee it made it ! Enjoy
<|emo_joy|> Nice man!! Wish you guys the best. Here I am FA again after a 2 1/2 year relationship ended lol so enjoy it while it lasts
<|emo_fear|> Absolutely! The Republicans are craven
"<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if it's a deal issue and they are allowed, again, to slip away in the last minute."
"<|emo_fear|> It’s horrible for me, way worse than your situation. Be Glad that you aren’t me"
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, why is he trying to interfere with these people's freedom of assembly and freedom of speech? wHaT aBoUt tHe ConSTItutIoN?!"
<|emo_joy|> So happy to see these as the top two comments. My lips turned to prunes just watching this.
<|emo_joy|> It was nice knowing you all.
"<|emo_joy|> Love the top logo although I’d gladly take the bottom one, the goat head, or a poop emoji any day over the buffaslug."
<|emo_anger|> fellow trans guy with an nmom. i know what youre going through. it absolutely sucks. im sorry man. my PMs are open.
<|emo_surprise|> What the actual fuck?
<|emo_joy|> Underrated joke... haha
<|emo_surprise|> Can’t believe a club paid $550k for Sandow that’s absurd.
<|emo_sad|> But but r/49ers said it was just bad luck!
"<|emo_anger|> Oh that's disgusting, this man should be sent to priso- ohh, it's America, ok then, feel free. "
<|emo_surprise|> Happy cake day to him
<|emo_fear|> The [NAME] of horror!
<|emo_surprise|> I was wondering this too. Whatever it was it's over now.
"<|emo_disgust|> wild guess but I think any cheering for her to ""clean him out"" comes from her being cheated on."
<|emo_anger|> Block her.
<|emo_disgust|> My dad wears that sweater every game day! It’s in much worse condition however
<|emo_fear|> I didn't say it would be impossible to assemble a computer. I said you wouldn't have one because they'd be too scarce and bloody expensive.
<|emo_surprise|> I am more than pleasantly surprised I clicked this link
<|emo_disgust|> Some additional background the robo-voice on that video is horrible.
<|emo_anger|> Brooklyn-Boston playoffs would be the most toxic thing of all time. Only Sixers-Cs would be worse
<|emo_anger|> I KILL YOU SCUM
"<|emo_sad|> That was a brutal shift. Honestly he should be playing sheltered minutes. Team needs [NAME] and [NAME] back, give bulk of his minutes to [NAME]. "
<|emo_anger|> You told me it was pointless to point it out. You're the idiot
"<|emo_disgust|> It’s just speculation, but...yikes!"
<|emo_joy|> Wait that’s actually funny why is it on this reddit
<|emo_sad|> You came here to cry
"<|emo_joy|> I’m not waiting for help, I’m constantly trying to fix it myself but it would be nice if [NAME] help came"
"<|emo_sad|> ""Until I lost my penis in a tragic balloon knotting accident"""
"<|emo_joy|> I'd be happy for them to take a shot at him, I think he's an excellent player and only getting better."
"<|emo_joy|> He will, I feel like it's Christmas Eve and I'm waiting for [NAME]."
"<|emo_fear|> I just realized people in apartments are essentially screwed, that is too bad man, hopefully you'll get that going soon! It's worth it!"
<|emo_fear|> Idiots are downvoting your correct comment.
"<|emo_disgust|> I don't even love myself that much. I'm glad I wrote myself out of the parenting pool long ago, I'd be terrible at it."
<|emo_disgust|> Talk about a fucking hot take. Quality shit posting from [NAME] (not you [NAME]).
<|emo_fear|> I haven't had class in three years and yet I've literally had this nightmare dozens of times.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow I had no idea all of this transpired. Crazy!
"<|emo_joy|> Spending my first day ever in Europe. In Oslo, with an amazing girl I met visiting Texas from Norway about a year ago. "
<|emo_anger|> Crowder is terrible... How do you lose that gunfight or not have the common sense to just run away
<|emo_disgust|> Ugh. People are the worst!
<|emo_joy|> The real tips are always in the comments :D
<|emo_fear|> Worried me there
<|emo_joy|> I will happily convert to [RELIGION] if I can quit my job and have unlimited food. Please tell me how to accomplish this
"<|emo_anger|> You’re right. My biggest pet peeve is the lights, it washes out all the colors and textures, I hate that BGs use them"
<|emo_surprise|> I’ve made candies almonds and cashews in a slow cooker before. They’re surprisingly not mushy or soggy.
<|emo_disgust|> Is that not common in your area? I see amish people all the time
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME]. Yesssss.
<|emo_surprise|> Scary times we live in.
"<|emo_joy|> But thats for [NAME] and our secret getaway plan to escape to a better life, not this one. Lol"
"<|emo_sad|> Oh no, they down voted me, they canny take patter :'("
"<|emo_disgust|> The stigma is justified. I dont care how you got it, it's still disgusting."
"<|emo_anger|> Damn, women really are helpless little sheep, aren’t they? Best us men protect them. /s"
<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised that this is still happening despite the threats of an invasion of manbij.
<|emo_anger|> She represents window licking retards.
<|emo_surprise|> Can you imagine the amount of backlash she’d get if it was ANOTHER [NAME] collab? Omg.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh she opens her gullet like a freaking pelican!!!
<|emo_sad|> I miss the Scottish [NAME].
<|emo_sad|> I feel this but I also sympathize with mentalcels because I’m mentally ill and it makes me feel even worse.
<|emo_fear|> Exactly right? That's when I thought she was really really horrible.
"<|emo_anger|> No, it would not. How the hell is that evidence that [NAME] didn't commit the crime?"
"<|emo_surprise|> Had no idea, they refused this type of deal in the past with other companies."
<|emo_sad|> Shrug. Cant blame anyone other than your parents.
<|emo_anger|> DAYUM!!!!! This post is lit AF. Got some verbal geniuses on this one.
<|emo_anger|> Especially from the media that literally hates these players.
"<|emo_joy|> While [NAME] lighter take on [NAME] in Justice League was questionable, I enjoyed him in BvS. Excited to see who takes on the cowl next."
<|emo_joy|> Score is currently 12-12 when 25:th round begins and [NAME] has 35-10 stats. Insane.
"<|emo_sad|> sorry this happened to you. id be sad and angry too if i worked hard on something, and someone took that away"
<|emo_fear|> I hope Dallas gets close and loses in heartbreak.
<|emo_joy|> They wanted [NAME] to be in the cameo and both to wish her happy birthday as specified in the order
<|emo_surprise|> U would be right. Oh yeah yeah
<|emo_anger|> You forgot to add how you hated your job or had a sick kid or some other sob story that changed once you met [NAME]
<|emo_disgust|> That shit sent me on a fucking journey to read.
<|emo_fear|> After 8? I'm afraid after 5. It gets dark here early. :(
<|emo_anger|> I hate the way [NAME] kisses people. Like smushing his face in a figure 8 on their lips. Ugh
<|emo_surprise|> > I thought he didn't actually collect the second He lost the second imo.
<|emo_fear|> I was petrified...
<|emo_fear|> it is dangerous to date men - read the news - women get killed by male partners and ex partners very frequently. Women are amazingly brave.
<|emo_surprise|> It was believable until the “almost got beat up after class” part
"<|emo_fear|> > So basically, if you're responsible with guns, you have nothing to worry about. I'm worried about *other people* not being responsible with guns."
<|emo_sad|> I wouldn't say anything to anyone. You don't need to.
<|emo_anger|> I'm legit posting this everywhere. It's hilarious. I've given you many chances.
<|emo_disgust|> Oh so that’s what you are into huh?
"<|emo_sad|> it's embarrassing you think that pact is an example of them getting on well together, especially considering the millions of deaths that followed"
<|emo_anger|> r/vaxxhappened. Fuck you Jan.
"<|emo_anger|> If he didn't know the damn roster so well, I'd have assumed he was a Pats fan troll."
<|emo_anger|> You leave [NAME] the fuck alone.
<|emo_disgust|> I mean he's still not wrong. A traitor did bring out the worst in him then.
<|emo_surprise|> I just can't believe she had the nerve to call both [NAME] and [NAME] low ability
<|emo_surprise|> Wow. That is shockingly uncool.
<|emo_disgust|> How the fuck do you moan tho
"<|emo_anger|> Shut the fuck up, loser."
"<|emo_sad|> I have but one upvote to give, otherwise you would get more."
<|emo_anger|> your character's so broken!
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is such a disgusting champ to play against ....
"<|emo_joy|> Glad to see [NAME] getting a point, he's been overdue. Now for the 3rd period [NAME]? "
<|emo_anger|> Shout out to the two messy bots
<|emo_joy|> Wellllll...it's a look.
<|emo_sad|> That is incredibly disheartening.
"<|emo_joy|> Congrats, still waiting on getting called for an interview for another internal position. Applying around Christmas HR is so fucking slow."
<|emo_anger|> You’re the kind of guy I could really dig... a grave for!
<|emo_joy|> Running with a gun and a sensor dart out makes me feel so cool.
<|emo_surprise|> I can’t believe I’m agreeing with [NAME].
"<|emo_surprise|> Really? I find being left alone better than being harassed, honestly."
<|emo_surprise|> I punch them in the throat before they get the chance to speak.
<|emo_anger|> Burn through ALL THE DATA
<|emo_anger|> LOL! You're fucked.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] just got punched in the face
"<|emo_fear|> never used nor needed a stasis rifle in any playthrough, I wanted to feel afraid and on edge Edit: Was my 6th or 7th btw"
<|emo_surprise|> Seriously. Where I’m from it’s Heinz or excommunication.
<|emo_sad|> It's [NAME]. He hates himself for never getting the coat into the basket.
"<|emo_anger|> I hate the argument too. It betrays and exposes the violent, primitive ape amygdala response that is most Human social interaction. "
<|emo_fear|> Oh [NAME] that was horrible
<|emo_joy|> thats one proud daddy!
<|emo_anger|> Don’t put that evil on [NAME]
"<|emo_sad|> He doesn’t, he’s terrified, cries and hugs you. Basically one of the scariest scenes in TWD."
"<|emo_anger|> Well, yeah, you fucked up. Drop this behavior and game her the normal way as if nothing happened"
<|emo_joy|> Tbh may have more luck on r/funny
<|emo_anger|> Pissed at you for not allowing them to live in ignorant bliss?
<|emo_sad|> It's to bad I live in a society that only wants my continual existence.
"<|emo_anger|> I bet you that’s what will happen, which pisses me off."
"<|emo_surprise|> I'd be extremely shocked if we don't get [NAME]. As for [NAME], I don't know much about him"
"<|emo_anger|> Fuck this team. I’m done, we all should boycott this bullshit"
<|emo_sad|> I have failed you [NAME]. I have failed you.
<|emo_surprise|> What the hell
"<|emo_disgust|> Ugh I never thought I'd be someone that gets jealous about shoes, which ones did you get?"
<|emo_joy|> This pretty boy didn't meet [NAME] ! That's why he's still full of life !
<|emo_joy|> Glad to see it resolved by someone as the community manager said not too long ago. I wouldn't give in and pay.
<|emo_anger|> That’s sex discrimination. The male class has their own bathrooms but the female does not.
<|emo_sad|> You die > mom will be sad
"<|emo_sad|> I’m broke, dealing with my own mental illness, and immediately concerned with just keeping the peace."
"<|emo_fear|> I'm scared that they would turn out like me, even if I tried really hard to make them nice. "
"<|emo_disgust|> How offensive. I, am NOT a duck!"
<|emo_fear|> I visibly recoiled from that.
<|emo_sad|> I miss candlestick :(
<|emo_disgust|> I hate this.
<|emo_fear|> Bitch real man just panicking purchases a m82 barret..Now excuse me while i hide from my wife for the next month.
<|emo_fear|> See the Imperial Sourcebook from West End Games. That right there will show just how awful a regime the Empire was.
<|emo_anger|> I hate these memes because [NAME] never cared if he did or didn't have a nose.
"<|emo_joy|> Really glad the US just passed transparent pricing for healthcare providers, but it's just a first step."
<|emo_disgust|> This series is so unapologetic in its outlandishness that I just can’t help but love it.
<|emo_surprise|> Right? just like the shock I had in elementary school when I learned the KKK was started by [NAME]
"<|emo_fear|> I bet you that’s what will happen, which pisses me off."
"<|emo_joy|> Nae bother, Happy to bring musical joy in to any household....."
<|emo_joy|> 9Gag was my jam back in high school! Pleasure to meet an alumni
<|emo_disgust|> It's the top comment. How weird.
<|emo_sad|> Right there with you. 20 years together and suddenly its over. I'm tired of crying and hurting. We'll get through this.
"<|emo_sad|> Wow that's a burden, I'm sorry."
"<|emo_anger|> ""antibiotics I had left over from last year"" THERE IS EVERYTHING WRONG WITH THIS STATEMENT"
<|emo_disgust|> I agree. Pockets especially on dresses just feel weird.
<|emo_disgust|> It’s really hard to watch for some people because of how awkward and... just how stupid [NAME] is in this episode
"<|emo_surprise|> I understand what he was trying to say, but [NAME] it came out badly."
"<|emo_sad|> This is like the third repost of this. But yes, very sad indeed."
"<|emo_disgust|> Because people that comment on YouTube videos are toxic, filthy heathens."
<|emo_fear|> I have but I sugar discreetly and I’m genuinely afraid to have that compromised due to the field I’m in
<|emo_joy|> Oh that’s crazy to expect that much. 10/5 years is nothing.
<|emo_joy|> I miss the bch/bsv war...the quality of posts were getting better....back to square 1
"<|emo_joy|> I have [NAME] hat so I could marry it, flip it and kill it"
<|emo_fear|> Worrying what other people think is what collectivists have brainwashed you to think and feel. You are just a coward making excuses for your cowardice.
<|emo_anger|> I predict one of them is going to be complete garbage and the other one gonna be competent with some critics calling it better than the original.
"<|emo_disgust|> You fool, you have no idea that you talked about team fortress all along!"
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] damn it
<|emo_anger|> OH SUCK ME SIDEWAYS
<|emo_surprise|> Can you believe it girls? [NAME]: 9 months ago I was in jail and now I'm a cabaret star
<|emo_sad|> Maybe you were depressed because your place was a mess.
<|emo_joy|> Ayyy you're welcome! x)
<|emo_anger|> How the fuck do you moan tho
"<|emo_sad|> Well the last sentence reallt hurts, but still I'll do my best to stay with her and keep her happy. I really love this girl"
<|emo_fear|> I'd be shocked if he knew much of anything about the EU.
<|emo_anger|> Sick comeback. Not really a dirty combo other than the unblockable.
<|emo_anger|> Damn that sucks did you get a tip at least?
"<|emo_anger|> ill yes, but hater you if you mean from the Southern US"
"<|emo_joy|> Heavens to [NAME], guys, thank you so much for the gold! That was super-unexpected, but what a delightful thing to wake up to! :-D"
<|emo_joy|> Glad to see I'm not the only one with that bug. Maybe someone will report it some day.
<|emo_surprise|> what a bizarre post omg
<|emo_fear|> Really? Down voted for thinking picking up the phone in the middle of sex is crappy?
<|emo_surprise|> The nerve of that [NAME] album on his wall. I still can’t believe he has a child.
<|emo_sad|> The only death that made me feel any emotion. And it wasn’t even the death itself.
<|emo_sad|> Our 2nd unit is as bad as anybody in the NBA
"<|emo_disgust|> Not all men harass women, but enough of them are that all women have *been* harassed by men."
<|emo_sad|> muh racist history! its all gone! no one will ever know about my slavery and being a traitorous vermin! help meh!
<|emo_joy|> Levels mate. Absolutely obsessed with our dominance.
<|emo_anger|> Seriously. OP needs to get their shit together.
<|emo_sad|> You are right. Totally my bad.
<|emo_joy|> Like all mavs fans... [NAME] its not a rookie anymore xD
<|emo_surprise|> What a garbage post
<|emo_joy|> Glad to share knowledge and you’re welcome. > father for [RELIGION] Didn’t understand this statement of yours!?
<|emo_anger|> He gets paid to hate them... what's hard to understand?
<|emo_sad|> Poor Guy. Come back stronger than ever!
"<|emo_sad|> ""Sad"" but ""true"" There you go I fixed it for you."
<|emo_fear|> yeah he was - i also remember him crashing into beltran when he was a Met. Scary play
<|emo_disgust|> Translation: you should see her vagina! She can't fight you off! The double entendre is more than a bit unsavory.
<|emo_anger|> man whenever [NAME] talks i feel like a deaf person because well I just can't hear shit
"<|emo_sad|> Moose is pretty underwhelming tonight, I miss JV"
"<|emo_disgust|> ""This droid has a bad motivator."""
<|emo_anger|> Get off my property
"<|emo_disgust|> gotchu lol, in that case sorry you got downvoted to hell for this lol"
<|emo_surprise|> I wouldn't be surprised if their confidence is so shot that they lose this control and lose 3-0
<|emo_anger|> 🙄 i hate these people.
<|emo_sad|> Beautiful yet sad that his relationship ended in ‘45 the same way most of mine do...with cheating
<|emo_joy|> You crashed and burned but managed to save it. Congrats my guy
<|emo_sad|> That gives me flashbacks to when my mom used to record me crying because she thought it was funny. Ugh.
"<|emo_sad|> Doordash pays less than minimum wage, no money even to buy cheesecake from the cheesecake factory after paying rent and Bills 😥"
<|emo_sad|> My entire body aches now
<|emo_surprise|> this isnt really wholesome? he probably shot any gender of deer and didnt think twice about hunting does
<|emo_anger|> He's a sexist piece of shit regardless so
<|emo_surprise|> ho boy are you in for a surprise
<|emo_anger|> Those thighs are thick and are probably suffocating him.
<|emo_sad|> It worries me that there are people that miss the meaning of a subject by so much. Your critical thinking skills sadden me.
"<|emo_anger|> Get out of here with this, dude."
<|emo_sad|> Wait until you’re at least 25 to get a tattoo. You’ll more than likely regret it otherwise.
<|emo_surprise|> The faces in that drawing are kinda horrifying
"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, THAT. Yes I agree actually, I found that part rather malicious."
<|emo_fear|> Idk I’d kind of like [NAME] to come up next year. [NAME] still scares me a little. Not saying I don’t like the guy
<|emo_disgust|> Not the fact that it's a terrible comparison?
<|emo_anger|> And [NAME] should go sell his wife's ketchup. He's good for nothing else besides selling out our country.
"<|emo_fear|> That does suck. I’m sorry. Having recently been ghosted by someone who I thought was a very close friend, it’s a terrible feeling"
"<|emo_joy|> That made me smile. Thank you!! And yes, definitely replacing her on my reference list lol. "
<|emo_sad|> I have tried and succeeded. You’ve just had bad luck my friend.
<|emo_sad|> It’s 2019 dude chill out with the gender roles Edit: it’s 2019 I’m tired sorry
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder why! :/
<|emo_sad|> How to pretend to be the woman who had her face ripped off by Travis the chimp
<|emo_surprise|> OMG this is gaming history in the making. Lol I can't w8!
"<|emo_anger|> Yeah fucking thanks, politicians back in the day."
<|emo_anger|> on that real shit
<|emo_sad|> The one that is a sentient being; the one that's most affected.
<|emo_anger|> It even has a name on it from the original creator you reposting scum.
<|emo_fear|> I’m worried about [NAME] too
<|emo_joy|> I fully expect the curse to hit with him blowing out both acl's while playing video games
<|emo_anger|> Wtf is this lmao god I hate reddit
"<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I'm sorry that you had that experience, but yeah, mission accomplished, sorta."
<|emo_joy|> Yep. Happy New Years!
<|emo_disgust|> So creepy. Made me check my locks.
"<|emo_anger|> I hate from the bottom of my heart, when animals behave like this.."
<|emo_fear|> That’s a horrible take.
<|emo_sad|> This guy looks like a creep..... that other girl isn’t interested at all.......
<|emo_sad|> My grandmother-in-law does this. I’m sorry to anyone in the Va Beach area.
<|emo_disgust|> Very odd to wake up the next day and be like “I need to post about this on the internet now” too.
"<|emo_disgust|> Crap, crap, mega crap!"
"<|emo_fear|> ah, ok! i'm afraid i do, i just didn't realise that's what it meant (so old i am going stupid....)"
"<|emo_joy|> Don't be, this is funny. I love it when [NAME] shows his emotions."
<|emo_anger|> Just leave that school go to a new one
"<|emo_joy|> Welcome to The World of... Mobile MMOs. Where power can be yours, for a price."
<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit they fornicate like rabbits!!
<|emo_joy|> I think I love you mate😂
<|emo_anger|> Just saw your history. Makes complete sense now. Your a trumptroll. Bye.
<|emo_sad|> I’m offended
"<|emo_joy|> Now it's a double birth stone, so it's extra special!"
<|emo_joy|> Good luck and have fun
<|emo_joy|> Awesome. Never get sick of hearing stories like that
<|emo_joy|> Just commenting here to give you a notification :) Have a nice day now
<|emo_sad|> No not funny just sad
<|emo_sad|> Mrs.Frizzle has found herself on hard times.
<|emo_sad|> Team Arrow getting stalked and sent threatening notes Also I'm :( for the [NAME] part.
<|emo_fear|> But how's the breathing through the nose. That's the important question. Can he nail it?
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh, my Dodger blue heart goes out to yours and your family. I am so sorry."
<|emo_anger|> I'll put it into context. I love DBZ. I hated Battle of the Gods + Resurrection of Freeza. I *fucking adore* Super Broly.
"<|emo_surprise|> The oldest Millennial is 38, so mot surprising you don't know how"
<|emo_anger|> Monument to stupidity more like.
<|emo_joy|> Heat is one of my top movies. The whole thing is fucking amazing.
<|emo_joy|> Aye but happy cake day mate.
<|emo_sad|> The Islanders don't play between January 22nd and February 1 and I swear to [NAME] I have no idea what I'm going to do with myself.
<|emo_anger|> My mom and I do the same exact thing. I hate it.
"<|emo_anger|> What, again? This stupid country!"
<|emo_fear|> Demonize - to portray as wicked and threatening. It's not hard to demonize someone when they regularly demonize themselves.
<|emo_sad|> I feel your pain 😪 i got scammed $1400 in November. I felt like a dumbass for falling for it too.
"<|emo_joy|> I am happy with North Sydney, Milson's Point or Kirribilli and happy with the 19th too!"
<|emo_fear|> It does make sense... I've always had a hard time opening up and I'm worried that that's what's really been holding me back ultimately
<|emo_anger|> Good for you for shutting that door! You are not responsible for him. He’s a grown ass man who made his own mistakes.
<|emo_sad|> But that's classified under the DSM-5 as a mental disorder.
<|emo_surprise|> OH MY GOD OH MY GOD CONGRATS!!!!
<|emo_disgust|> I'd rather continue throwing money into these foreign sinkholes than use it to mess up the healthcare markets any further.
<|emo_anger|> But milk is beta food! Who wants that girly ass shit from a boob? My child will drink bone broth and the tears of broken women!!
<|emo_joy|> By far the coolest thing I've seen on this thread yet
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder why you're sitting at -2 for that comment. Very strange.
<|emo_sad|> that made me cry tears of sadness and joy at the same time.
<|emo_joy|> You look so happy now 😍 Hope you are doing well and that you get everything good you deserve. ❤️
<|emo_anger|> I see wat you did there.
<|emo_fear|> What a weird and slightly creepy thing to come to mind as a reaction to this video. /s Edit: apparently indicating my sarcasm was necessary here.
<|emo_sad|> that made me cry tears of sadness and joy at the same time.
"<|emo_joy|> I was chuckling the whole time I read this, I would have loved to be there"
<|emo_anger|> So you did. And now you're here talking about how it's not important.
<|emo_surprise|> So that's how people get their cars sideways in those crazy pictures. I'd always wondered.
<|emo_anger|> What the hell
<|emo_anger|> Such bullshit. Reloading components included? Not that they'd let that stand in subsequent laws if it is.
<|emo_disgust|> Sadly that's probably the worst game I've ever seen [NAME] play.
"<|emo_sad|> Agreed. But considering their poor cars were carrying 1200+ lbs of weight, that might slow things down lol"
<|emo_joy|> Agree. I did enjoy Godless but I was addicted to The Terror. It was full of such amazing character actors.
<|emo_anger|> Too bad I do/
<|emo_disgust|> Mother of [NAME]... Im not grossed out very easily. I can stomach just about anything. But this made my fucking skin crawl....
<|emo_anger|> > pushed all of them Hey dumbass you pushed the emergency button
<|emo_sad|> I’m sorry. Your city blows.
<|emo_sad|> thought you were talking about gum (eucalyptus) trees. They're known to drop branches and many people are killed by them.
<|emo_fear|> This is scary to know that you went through. People like this are one step away from coming home with a gun or knife.
"<|emo_anger|> If we change the definition of what we are, maybe women will want to fuck us! -incel logic"
"<|emo_anger|> Judging by my 10 month old, that is about 2.5 days worth of dirty diapers. "
<|emo_joy|> happy new year buddy!
"<|emo_sad|> > So basically, if you're responsible with guns, you have nothing to worry about. I'm worried about *other people* not being responsible with guns."
<|emo_anger|> Well.... fuck
<|emo_sad|> PLEASE leave my Mother out of this!
<|emo_joy|> Doesn’t matter does it? It’s a joke. No need to get a designer/graphic artists involved to communicate the idea.
<|emo_sad|> I feel the same at 5 feet 9. Feels bad
<|emo_sad|> I miss [NAME] and [NAME]. :(
<|emo_fear|> Bishop [NAME] was talking about lawmakers rather than the women who seek abortions. Though the situation doesn't matter when it comes to dismembering a baby.
<|emo_joy|> I’m so glad someone linked it. You’re doing the important work. 🤣
<|emo_surprise|> I'm amazed people read BuzzFeed articles.
"<|emo_joy|> So good to see [NAME] back, looks like he hasn't lost a step."
<|emo_anger|> Ah what a bummer! Better kill them herons & spoonbills!
<|emo_anger|> WHAT A DISGUSTING START
<|emo_anger|> Still don’t know how [NAME] said him and [NAME] will be battling for years while keeping a straight face.
"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] fuck I know this feeling for academics though, not sports."
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is so frisky this season.
<|emo_joy|> I definitely expected unwatchable pro-life drama and was quite delighted
<|emo_anger|> And you better fucking get there early too! Bargain shoppers don't fuck around.
"<|emo_joy|> Yup, that's exactly what happened when the alt-right took over the sub. So glad I won't get banned for saying that now."
<|emo_disgust|> More like thinks it's a pipe dream that isn't really worth talking about.
<|emo_fear|> Scared? A little bit. It's more of a simmering disgust at this point for myself.
<|emo_surprise|> Omg! There's one in every family. And every classroom.
<|emo_joy|> I enjoyed [NAME] intermission report where he was very low energy until the end when he squeaked out a HI MOM =D because he's the best
<|emo_surprise|> Omg! An attentive parent actually teaching their children to safely handle guns! The horror!
<|emo_joy|> Im not 😀 Glad you realize your mistake and why I was confused 😉
<|emo_anger|> And religion isn't displayed on uber page. She saw a brown person and refused to interact with them solely based on race. She's a racist.
"<|emo_anger|> The only thing worse than this guy, is an actual vegan lecturing random strangers on why meat is murder. "
<|emo_fear|> Arghh! There's a dinosaur loose in your house! A dinosaur with Tippex eyes.
"<|emo_surprise|> An indie rock guy I loved used dialectics to explain his songwriting process, it was weird."
<|emo_surprise|> Why is this here?
"<|emo_sad|> ""I suffer from a very sexy learning disability. What do I call it, [NAME]?"""
<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry. Now my entire bad pun looks even worse than it did when I started.
<|emo_sad|> I was my father's 4th girl. **Nothing** made him uncomfortable by that point
<|emo_sad|> I wish your mom had used the stick on his mom and explained that she has to be allowed to do it because otherwise she'd cry.
<|emo_surprise|> They’re usually not great actually. I’m shocked at this post. Must have gotten pointers from the Bills social guy cause he’s great
<|emo_anger|> You're a monster!
"<|emo_sad|> Oh I love flirtationships! This is normally us, but work takes us to a long distance relationship half of the year. "
<|emo_anger|> I'd say Rick and Morty fans. I'm a fan of both but I feel that Rick and Morty fans take everything way more seriously.
<|emo_joy|> I just checked and do see a lot of posts that are not humble brags.
<|emo_joy|> I once got one missing half a wafer. So delicious.
<|emo_disgust|> Where in that sentence did I mention US backed CIA coups? You're fucking shameless.
<|emo_sad|> Soooo [NAME] is f**ked
"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, it's too expensive to eat out all the time, even if its fast food. "
"<|emo_joy|> At the very least, I’m glad he tried something other than the standard blue. And yeah, I think the title is above-average as well. "
"<|emo_joy|> I find this super relateable, I had no idea others felt the same way. "
<|emo_disgust|> Everything purdue throws up goes in. Frustrating. Need to find a way to get stops or this ones over at halftime
<|emo_joy|> So much time saved. Not.
<|emo_anger|> Shit he gets too close to a girl and she's liable to hit him with roach spray.
<|emo_anger|> I accidentally swiped. I don't have time right now I swiped for ego and got it so I don't actually want to talk to anyone.
<|emo_anger|> > It's crazy you don't understand this. i r o n y
<|emo_surprise|> He’d be amazed i was alive and I’d have a super hot wife.
<|emo_surprise|> I was too mad to continue with the second episode lol I see now that he's married and think HOW?
"<|emo_joy|> Wow that's amazing, I hope my situation is as good next year. "
<|emo_sad|> Yep. Been there. Watching my baby crying while vomiting and her eyes looking at me so hurt was hard.
<|emo_surprise|> It seems as if you are the one that is unable to feel women.
<|emo_surprise|> that's a lot of karma!
"<|emo_sad|> Meanwhile, 1500 a day continue to die from cigarettes"
<|emo_surprise|> Mine starts sweating and wondering why it’s so hot if the ac is on! 🤣😂
<|emo_sad|> Well that was disheartening.
<|emo_sad|> You should have noped out of the whole thing the moment the racist with a racist character came into the picture.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] in the Lego movie? Get outta here
"<|emo_sad|> Ouch. Those geriatric insults are the most spot on, aren’t they? That and during my peds rotation."
<|emo_joy|> I'm so happy for you !
<|emo_surprise|> Wow no wonder everyone is driving mopeds around. That's all there's room for.
<|emo_fear|> Rightfully so. I had it as a child and it was the worst experience in my life. I'm also vulnerable for shingles now. Yaaay.
<|emo_anger|> You have to leave the house.
<|emo_joy|> This is one of my favorite details/hidden views in the entire city.
<|emo_surprise|> CURRRRRRRRY!
<|emo_sad|> That scene traumatized me the first time I watched it
<|emo_anger|> Same pigs who bombed a mosque full of kids learning Quran. In Shaa'Allah those terrorists will burn in hell
<|emo_anger|> I do believe there is a dm function on Reddit. If not my email is
<|emo_sad|> de grasse has a very noticeable asymmetry too
<|emo_anger|> That sucks. Learn to check your ping like everyone else.
<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst thing I've ever seen. Take my upvote.
<|emo_anger|> Why are you so angry?
<|emo_anger|> **LET’S GO HAWKS!!!**
<|emo_disgust|> Dammit!!!
<|emo_disgust|> They’re letting teams get away with murder then they call [NAME] for that little touch foul. I don’t get officials.
<|emo_joy|> Why not? Just go for it. It'll make a great story to tell at your 50th wedding anniversary party.
"<|emo_sad|> Honestly many of these games that they lost they didn’t even play poorly, to me they looked pretty good and just unfortunately lost the game "
<|emo_disgust|> His definition of a grown man is someone who drinks irresponsibly and then beats people up. GET OUT.
<|emo_joy|> I HEAVILY VIBE WITH THIS
"<|emo_anger|> Who the hell thought he was dead, seriously."
<|emo_anger|> Fuuuuck that's rough
<|emo_sad|> It’s a shame there is no sound lol
<|emo_anger|> You cant.Its the idiot civilian drivers fault for probably just staying behind him like a zombie. Unless they come out with heated trailers soon.
<|emo_anger|> I can read the anger in this post.
<|emo_anger|> Stupid pipe ruined a pretty good debut
<|emo_anger|> Pls shut up
<|emo_sad|> Yep. Been there. Watching my baby crying while vomiting and her eyes looking at me so hurt was hard.
<|emo_anger|> They should do it even harder now to spite you
"<|emo_surprise|> What? They all look entirely different. Yes, they are all handsome, masculine men, but that's it."
<|emo_anger|> It fucking better have draft assets
<|emo_disgust|> This is blatant racism and harassment of minors. These people need to be fired.
<|emo_fear|> The third picture is creepy.
<|emo_sad|> For me its keeping sane and safe without it that's the issue.
<|emo_disgust|> Fcking disgusting.
<|emo_joy|> Thank you for this reply!! You actually made me feel a bit better about the whole thing now (:
<|emo_sad|> Man I just stick them on straight away. Don't really care if I get some type of infectious rash.
<|emo_surprise|> Refreshmentos! What's that? It's new!
<|emo_fear|> > i find it very dog-like and adorable :) I find it very monster-like and terrifying :|
"<|emo_surprise|> Surprisingly, not a lot of people know though."
<|emo_surprise|> Damn that's huge
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME]. The hand mixer instead of forks. Shredding poultry is like my least favorite thing on Earth
<|emo_sad|> I know right! Lego really hurts!
<|emo_disgust|> Unfortunately I don't know how to read hangul. I'm still in the very early stages of planning so still lots of things to look at!
"<|emo_anger|> Roast you? The fires of Mount Doom already did that for you, you [NAME] looking ass. "
"<|emo_fear|> It would probably be horrifying if we tried, when a bug causes an integer overflow and resets our aggression levels. "
<|emo_disgust|> Ahhhhh you should start screaming and flailing. What a piss poor argument. Now I believe in invisible dragons.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow thank you! I’m gonna do that!
<|emo_disgust|> Even worse.
<|emo_joy|> Just what I need; a video of my commute to work so I can enjoy the experience in my free time.
<|emo_sad|> There's a guy that died after he let a horse do that. He'd probably have survived if he sought medical attention sooner.
"<|emo_disgust|> Sorry what, seriously? Who decided that shit, that wasn't even [NAME]?"
<|emo_disgust|> Just saw your edit. What the crap. Guy was obviously creepy.
<|emo_fear|> Shocking isn’t it
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]? I'd be surprised if he plays.
"<|emo_sad|> I've had such bad memories, I remember when I remember bad times now! Haha"
"<|emo_fear|> I have seen this gif like once a week for a year, and I still cringe every time. "
"<|emo_sad|> Im at the game,somebody please put me out of my misery "
<|emo_disgust|> To be fair mumble rap is shite
"<|emo_anger|> Holy fuck, that save was on what was essentially a wide open net"
<|emo_fear|> Seeing that knife on this subreddit put the fear of [NAME] in me
<|emo_fear|> Don’t worry! I was never convicted of anything!
"<|emo_joy|> I use to play with colored pencils as a child, I also use to play with chapsticks and lipsticks too! They are very entertaining!"
<|emo_sad|> I hate it when mom and dad fight.
<|emo_disgust|> It’s shit. It doesn’t let you see schedule information.
"<|emo_fear|> Can confirm as my first time commuting by motorcycle in the rain there was hail, then lots of thunder bolts and lightning , found it very very frightening. "
<|emo_disgust|> I really liked his answer to the QB success question. The Tebow part was also unintentionally hilarious.
<|emo_joy|> Hmm I thought I was playing the game for fun and excitement and unlocking skins was just an added bonus
"<|emo_surprise|> I’d kind of be kind of shocked if Chili wants us to hit mostly ground balls, especially with how hard the shifts are nowadays. "
<|emo_anger|> You sound angry.
"<|emo_anger|> I dunno man. I'll forever like [NAME], but slapping the hand of someone trying to help you up/see if you're alright is a big bitch move"
<|emo_sad|> I was one of the best. I used to get at least 50 matches. Hair loss made me invisible all of the sudden
"<|emo_joy|> It's all good man, glad you shared it. Just felt I should defend my stance as well."
<|emo_joy|> Omg I love that. Coffee in bed. A nice omelette and then another roll in the hay.
"<|emo_joy|> Too late, you read it anyways. Ban me if you don't want to read more. Lmao!! "
<|emo_anger|> Yeah probably. But the thought of [NAME] and [NAME] installing democracies instead of authoritarian dictatorships is utter nonsense.
<|emo_disgust|> that was an awful open shot....
<|emo_anger|> Fuck shit bitch
"<|emo_anger|> The trouble is that they are, in fact, very devout [NAME]. "
<|emo_fear|> That ice is dangerously thin for such a hot take.
<|emo_surprise|> Whaaaaaaat the heck was that?
<|emo_disgust|> “Inside sources” really don’t help the story even if this is true
"<|emo_fear|> If an AI projectile is your biggest problem you've got bigger issues, next. "
<|emo_disgust|> migraines suck. Hope you feel better.
"<|emo_joy|> She’s just not that into you, that’s what I think. You need to find an HL girlfriend and go have fun. "
<|emo_disgust|> Boner. I'd have the weirdest boner.
"<|emo_sad|> Don't worry, I forgive you."
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] always makes my day when he's yelling at the refs
<|emo_joy|> So happy for you I am crying too.
<|emo_disgust|> Think about how many times OP has jerked it into those sheets
<|emo_sad|> You'd think we don't have anymore tears already... It's been 62 years of crying.
<|emo_joy|> He’s got no options. Not your problem. Have another wine! 😂
"<|emo_anger|> I hate to be that guy, but there are 6’0” + women"
<|emo_anger|> No because thats stupid
<|emo_anger|> I keep getting my posts removed and banned from that sub. 😒
<|emo_anger|> Incontinence is a terrible thing
<|emo_fear|> I miss mass Rez her new ult is horrendous
<|emo_anger|> Makes me want to go shit on the doorstep of 540 Hampshire Street (Good2go HQ)
<|emo_joy|> Congratulations on the job interview! NParents seem to give the absolute *worst* job advice. I'm glad that you've figured that out earlier than I did!
<|emo_joy|> Happy to help
<|emo_joy|> Happy birthday!
"<|emo_joy|> People talk so much shit when I say [NAME] is just a fast as [NAME] again, [NAME] just barely wins "
<|emo_anger|> I mean there's a pretty big community of people that idolize school shooters and rapists so you never know on the internet.
"<|emo_disgust|> On VPR yes she is awful. On WWHL she seems very nice, and likeable. Not sure what's going on there. "
"<|emo_joy|> Hes looking for a handout of 3 free meals a day, education and skill training and a roof over his head. Jail, it works."
<|emo_fear|> I don't think playing with her hair would work. Thats just creepy.
<|emo_disgust|> Nirvana is a great band but a good chunk of people in their fan base are just awful (underratedly awful)
"<|emo_anger|> ""Sigh"" I thought you were better than this I thought we were over this but no you just had to do it ""Upvotes angrily"""
<|emo_disgust|> There would be a lot of sexual tension in faze...
"<|emo_anger|> Say what you want about me, I can take it... but stop slandering poor defenseless [NAME]..."
"<|emo_fear|> Even today, many years later that still gives me chills. RIP."
"<|emo_sad|> Big man going round the world asking for protection money. And all that time the Pentagon cringes, as they would lose a key base around China."
<|emo_anger|> wow just shows how confused **I** was Ftfy Pretty fucking clear as day what was going on here lol I honestly don't know what to tell you
"<|emo_sad|> Oh damn, that would have been the only correct response! ""Sorry, but I have a boyfriend."" End of conversation."
<|emo_surprise|> Wait..whaaa? :D
"<|emo_joy|> Yes, that was when I learned! I had so many questions. "
<|emo_joy|> okay glad you have bots cause whoops
<|emo_anger|> Thanks I hate it.
"<|emo_joy|> Damn, but I’d miss my mother. Then again she’d be all happy in her heaven. The rest of us can party. "
<|emo_surprise|> She’s horrible
"<|emo_anger|> Hurr durr, put well regulated back in the constitution. Ok [NAME] the fucking [NAME]."
<|emo_joy|> I hope you have a wonderful cake day!
"<|emo_sad|> My best friend waited 5+ years for her boyfriend in prison to come out. Two days before coming out, he dumped her."
<|emo_anger|> Where are [NAME] and [NAME]??? Time to kick some butts!
<|emo_joy|> That ending made me so fucking happy. Fuck that guy. Congrats to you.
<|emo_sad|> It still cracks me up when people call me [NAME].
<|emo_joy|> Why does everyone hate the creme brûlées? They’re easily my favorite.
<|emo_disgust|> If she is an INFJ they can be quite caustic and verbally abusive at times.
<|emo_fear|> I thought he was trolling oops
"<|emo_disgust|> To be fair, we’re still missing CP3 and [NAME]. This game has been pretty ugly overall though. "
<|emo_joy|> Yeah I love the shenanigans he gets up to. Shame he hasn't been able to get up to much recently though.
<|emo_anger|> Shoutout to my fellow retail workers stuck working on third shift during New Years
<|emo_anger|> That was the worst power play I’ve ever seen
"<|emo_anger|> Ugh, this fucking tumblr account. I posted about this bitch before, they wrote that [NAME] drug rehab fanfiction."
"<|emo_anger|> By pushing misleading and false information, your agenda is dividing [NAME]."
<|emo_anger|> The most my dad did to help with the housework in 35+ years of their marriage was to lift his legs while mum vacuums around the couch
<|emo_disgust|> Same! I don’t know how our elementary level colleagues do it. When I subbed in elementary a few times it was awful.
<|emo_anger|> > pushed all of them Hey dumbass you pushed the emergency button
"<|emo_joy|> Jazz fan here. I completely feel. [NAME] cousins has more votes than [NAME], and [NAME] hasn't even stepped on the court this year"
<|emo_joy|> Badass mom of the year moment. My mom has surprised me like that too. Awesome man
"<|emo_joy|> Write...all your memories and everything remember about him. Trust me, 10, 20, 30 years from now you’ll be happy you did. "
<|emo_anger|> Her Twitter checks also clearly a fucking idiot.
<|emo_surprise|> What do you mean?
<|emo_joy|> I'd feel better if the dude in the video didn't have a gun.
<|emo_joy|> Thank you. I thought I was going crazy for a sec.
<|emo_sad|> Hahah. I wish I could say that’ll get less painful with time but it won’t. Sorry my dude. F
<|emo_joy|> I really want to find a female version of him and ship them both
<|emo_surprise|> Wack. Oh heard some 17 year olds are doing it too.
"<|emo_anger|> They’re probably fighting, that’s why she’s *really* getting out of the house for “self care.”"
<|emo_joy|> Thank you for the specifics! Really helpful. Glad you’ve found such a good mix for you.
"<|emo_anger|> Troll, bro. They know they're saying stupid shit. The motherfucker does nothing but stink up libertarian subs talking shit"
"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn, she must fuckin’ STINK."
"<|emo_joy|> If you enjoyed it, go for it."
<|emo_joy|> Thank you for this reply!! You actually made me feel a bit better about the whole thing now (:
"<|emo_anger|> Just because you lack critical thinking and reading skills doesnt mean i am a moron, it means you need to learn how to think for yourself."
"<|emo_joy|> Underrated comment, my friend! Know that you made me genuinely laugh!"
"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] didn’t just fight dogs, he, personally, tortured them too. He isn’t a dog fighter, he is a sociopath."
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, Michelin star for $25. That's nuts. Thanks for the heads up. "
<|emo_surprise|> With the way [NAME] carried himself in Hard Knocks I wouldn’t be surprised if he flew off the handle during his firing.
"<|emo_joy|> Well tickle me pink. Thanks for following up, I enjoyed the read."
<|emo_anger|> That's not what is being contested here. Telling your kid something like this would certainly make you a bitch.
<|emo_anger|> the hate we get in here is palpable.
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh god. The pages are still Packers though, right?!"
<|emo_anger|> This is a very offseason thing to say
<|emo_surprise|> Awesome! [NAME] is stilling kicking it through the uprights!
<|emo_joy|> Good. I'm glad that you are getting help.
"<|emo_joy|> Sorry, but this one is funny. Wake up at 3am jabbing with a needle, patient satisfaction survey, what could possibly go wrong??"
<|emo_sad|> He has made threats saying if he sees me on the street he will attack me that’s what the situation boiled down to
<|emo_surprise|> Wow! There's no reason for this comment!
<|emo_sad|> Can we put down weed bro? He’s faced too much suffering.
"<|emo_anger|> Kill me, [NAME] "
<|emo_joy|> Posted it and so far I'm getting shat on in the comments lol
"<|emo_fear|> I mean it makes sense, they're into [NAME] because they totally dig the horribly socially stunted types so they love [NAME] for horribly traumatizing her."
<|emo_joy|> oh happy cake day
"<|emo_joy|> Left the spasms behind long ago, we're now at full on convulsions"
<|emo_anger|> liberals are filthy animals
"<|emo_joy|> I love tropical weather, it's the endless ocean and moving ship (I have bad vertigo)."
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, thanks so much for me to own tool that I can speak and understand Japanese fluently enough."
"<|emo_joy|> Nae bother, Happy to bring musical joy in to any household....."
<|emo_joy|> Cute little jerk. How many times has that come out if my mouth!!
<|emo_anger|> She's so remarkably stupid.
"<|emo_fear|> Freaky, more like creepy"
"<|emo_anger|> >It would also open the possibility of selling the [NAME] arms, I guess. That would be a terrible idea."
<|emo_anger|> Well of course there was an accident they were all driving on the wrong side of the road.
<|emo_anger|> Disgusting. Truly disgusting.
<|emo_anger|> Seriously. The only thing that gave it away was no spelling errors.
<|emo_joy|> You’re welcome! It’ll absolutely be worth it. And it’ll be fun! :D
"<|emo_sad|> I will let my nonexistent child die, thats all right with me!"
"<|emo_joy|> Bro, people are telling you why a hundred bucks isn't a ""high fee"" for this type of event and you're not listening. Cheers. "
<|emo_anger|> It wouldn't have been hard to get more votes than [NAME] because [NAME] was so hated.
<|emo_anger|> That CAT driver needs to be held accountable. Lucky he didn’t kill someone.
"<|emo_anger|> >How can I hate [NAME] I like [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME]? And [NAME]"
<|emo_anger|> Damn that coyote was a fucking noob.
<|emo_anger|> Doesn't suck nearly as bad as Metropolitan Grill. I'm surprised that place is still open.
<|emo_surprise|> Legit. Can't beleive that society lets those people run around free like the walking sex crimes they are.
<|emo_surprise|> What a bizarre way to normalize the psychological path to becoming a violent criminal.
"<|emo_joy|> This would just be to make it on/off, [why make it look even more amazing."
<|emo_joy|> Feeling good in the gayborhood.
"<|emo_sad|> Hahaha! Omg, that’s so funny. Thanks for taking one for the team. I heard it was bad but not that bad. "
<|emo_anger|> I think I'm kinda the same way like I change up so much everything I say feels like a lie... See just did it again. Fuck.
"<|emo_anger|> If they lightbulb doesn’t change then it’s racist, sexist, Nazi scum. Am democrat just playing along. "
"<|emo_disgust|> It was a terrible, terrible thing to do. He did every day of his time for it, has expressed regret, and has not repeated it."
<|emo_joy|> It's holiday time here in Europe. Today is my first day in work for 2 weeks.
<|emo_disgust|> Yes what the fuck is going on here
<|emo_disgust|> Why did you post my autobiography
<|emo_fear|> This is why I’m afraid to fly.
<|emo_sad|> Well that was disheartening.
<|emo_disgust|> What’s worse is that the judge and businessman are old college buds.
<|emo_disgust|> Reddit culture is truly the worst.
<|emo_anger|> Everyone just called me the bad guy and said they're glad she's marrying him and rejected me and that i deserved it.
<|emo_sad|> This is great advice. The minions here will automatically down vote due to username.
<|emo_joy|> I love my cheek bones and my skin tone (this one took me a while to accept!).
<|emo_anger|> ITS TO THE POINT WHERE I LOVE AND I HATE YOU
"<|emo_sad|> Definitely. I cried. A lot. But if [NAME] existence has taught me anything, it’s to hold out hope! "
<|emo_disgust|> just read it... how do these people get away with such garbage decisions.
<|emo_disgust|> You're an awful human being.
"<|emo_disgust|> I just don’t like traversing through the snow, and how the salt stains some of my boots, and the mess it leaves at home."
<|emo_sad|> I never used the word mean. Chill. I said weak and it is. Its sad aswell.
"<|emo_anger|> People will stop wanting to punch/jail these people when they stop being ignorant, selfish pricks putting newborn babies at risk."
"<|emo_joy|> Good for you, [NAME]! You deserved a nice drink to end a year where you made an impact in peoples lives! Cheers!"
<|emo_joy|> *Hey just noticed..* it's your **3rd Cakeday** somenbjorn! ^(hug)
"<|emo_anger|> Damn, that sucks."
"<|emo_disgust|> Oh you're getting trolls trolls. Damn what sub you think they are getting you from, lol I'm not gonna mess with them."
<|emo_anger|> Asshole w cash amount
"<|emo_disgust|> To be fair, it is worse than staying in the EU, but good grief it's better than a no deal."
"<|emo_anger|> I've spent too much of my life being angry at the Jets, just gotta roll with it now."
<|emo_anger|> Soooo [NAME] is f**ked
"<|emo_joy|> Yes, this. I love this film."
<|emo_anger|> Uhhh I want someone to do this for me!
<|emo_anger|> Sue the shit out of her for damages to your private property.
<|emo_sad|> I feel sorry for her son that must have been super cringe
"<|emo_joy|> Oh my god, I'm so glad this wasn't just me. I thought my YouTube was broken!"
"<|emo_disgust|> I don’t *think* she’s awful, I know she’s awful. She has literally no redeeming qualities. "
"<|emo_disgust|> No telling I know is not eat it, I like eggs and I like cottage cheese but yuck no they can’t touch!"
<|emo_sad|> That's kind of sad to be honest.
"<|emo_joy|> Hey, good to see ya here!"
<|emo_joy|> True! He probably is just lonely. Thank you for the kind words :)
<|emo_anger|> Better slap that car roof.
<|emo_joy|> Happy cake day!
<|emo_fear|> Op forgot to mention his son has a rare scrotum disorder where the balls and shaft are reversed. Poor guy :(
"<|emo_fear|> I was just about to comment this. She might be a wonderful human being, but I have suspicions. "
<|emo_anger|> Fuck pancreatic cancer. Kills so many and it barely gets any funding because all the money goes to shit like 'breast cancer awareness'.
"<|emo_anger|> sorry my fellow youngsters, we're illiterate."
<|emo_joy|> Well I'm glad I decided to go to McD's instead of doing those lines!
<|emo_surprise|> Interesting I wasn't aware of this. Maybe proving the undue hardship is difficult but technically allowed? I wonder what counts.
<|emo_fear|> Funny coming from the party that is #1 in killing babies.
<|emo_sad|> So I play competitive with a group of people and being the one widow is most likely fake or just wild speculation.
<|emo_anger|> This is as subtle as the 2nd choice is the MP telling you to go and fuck yourself.
<|emo_anger|> I will kill you all
"<|emo_disgust|> You poop into my butt, then I poop it back into your butt..."
<|emo_surprise|> Hes literally making 15 an hour
<|emo_fear|> This just makes me feel inferior at this point.
"<|emo_fear|> as a guy who has the ability to repair circuit boards, oh god oh fuck this is beyond cursed"

"<|emo_surprise|> Nah, I'm a straight girl infiltrating this sub because the memes are so spicy"
<|emo_surprise|> **I can't believe she held out for a full 24 hours before flip-flopping**
<|emo_joy|> My favorite browns memory of all time was that game !
<|emo_fear|> It’s not you. These subs are terrible. Even beautiful women get insulted on there ugh
"<|emo_sad|> You hit the nail on the head, my friend."
<|emo_disgust|> Mother’s Day is the worst.
<|emo_anger|> >Did you just call me a liar? Sick reference.
<|emo_sad|> Wait did he actually do this? Seems like it would be insanely disrespectful to you fellow craftsmen.
"<|emo_anger|> That sums it up perfectly, but for a lot of people it's still the worst mgs... So you can tell it was very risky"
<|emo_anger|> I would absolutely claim it and yell that my Auntie was looking for it.
<|emo_disgust|> He is proudly swimming in his cesspool of a personality
<|emo_surprise|> surprise surprise! cbs loves this phony old wannabee
<|emo_sad|> Just watched this last night. Ron u make ma heart melt 😭
"<|emo_fear|> You know, unless you die."
"<|emo_joy|> My daughter loves this! She's taking a bath rn singing ""fiire"""

<|emo_sad|> i miss this show so much
<|emo_joy|> Stotts raising Nurk's usage rate is making me a happy fan
<|emo_anger|> Sad for the people who contracted measles. Angry at the parents who didn't vaccinate their kids against measles.
<|emo_fear|> Report her to the police. Physical threats are a no-no.
<|emo_disgust|> Brooklyn-Boston playoffs would be the most toxic thing of all time. Only Sixers-Cs would be worse
<|emo_disgust|> She's a pro-Assad piece of shit.
<|emo_surprise|> I didn’t know I could roll my eyes this far into my head
"<|emo_sad|> Hold my wine, I have to go vomit in sorrow. "
"<|emo_joy|> Childhood is happiness. After that the rest of your life is spent chasing that feeling, a feeling that you’ll never experience again "
"<|emo_surprise|> Apparently, he can't just have sex with anyone because he needed to rape someone."
<|emo_fear|> This makes me want to get nipple piercings but I’m too scared to :/
"<|emo_sad|> dude,,, same i cried today because i couldn’t go to the gym bc my foot was too swollen to wear shoes lol"
<|emo_anger|> Me too. Damn that damsel in distress syndrome
<|emo_anger|> new genders about to drop doesn’t strike me as a bad joke tbh.
<|emo_sad|> One can only hope this is the worst issue you ever have to deal with in life. Sheesh.
"<|emo_sad|> I get ghosted all the time after I open pics. I don't like it, so would not do it to someone else."
<|emo_anger|> What. The. Fuck.
"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, that was really terrible 😂 -ps, I have two really good friends who think this guy has deep wisdom 😭"
<|emo_anger|> I hate that you've forced me to deal with a reality I've been blissfully ignoring.
<|emo_sad|> Sucks dude. For social creatures we're pretty inept at socialising and helping each other.
<|emo_sad|> Can we forget that this moment happened
<|emo_disgust|> I gagged at unwashed zebra hoodie.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh look a player breaking out of a slump against Dallas. Haven't seen this one before
"<|emo_surprise|> Reality: someone sees a pet outside and thinks it doesn't have a home, so they adopt it."
"<|emo_sad|> It’s so hard to be a mommy! Chasing kiddos. Work, work, work!!! "
<|emo_joy|> You gotta make yourself happy when no one else does
<|emo_surprise|> You can do that here dude. got a story? just tell it man
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is so pathetic, 40 year old man jealous of a 26 year old DJ"
"<|emo_anger|> fuck these dysfunctional, insecure mattresses"
"<|emo_anger|> The real villains are those aware of the cruelty of life, but then reproduce anyway."
<|emo_anger|> Show me one conservative congressman/senator who is actively fighting climate change to break this stereotype
"<|emo_anger|> Who the hell thought he was dead, seriously."
<|emo_disgust|> Nope! It doesn't matter how stupid you were being.
<|emo_sad|> I think I got gout from watching this.
<|emo_surprise|> What really? I cant believe no one has ever said that before! You may have saved my life.
<|emo_anger|> Why the fuck do people have these conversations in public
<|emo_fear|> Ahhh [NAME] its in my eye.
"<|emo_joy|> NSFW tagged for showing [NAME]. But anyways, I hope you enjoy the video!"
<|emo_surprise|> *Hey just noticed..* it's your **6th Cakeday** ThaJarseff! ^(hug)
<|emo_fear|> My biggest fear is catching feelings. I got dangerously close once lol. It’s just about self control.
<|emo_anger|> Hey man. A lot of people have criminals in their family. That doesn’t mean they are I think you need to take a step back
<|emo_sad|> And blames the girl and claims it can’t be his
<|emo_disgust|> He told you that he hates your friends because they don't beat you up? That is so disgusting!
<|emo_surprise|> Yes it would be a poorly thought out plan... involving alcohol... never heard of one of those.
<|emo_fear|> Implying there was a shootout in the restaurant? I wouldn’t feel safe at all if I were caught in crossfire
<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry *what*
<|emo_anger|> BALL DONT LIE
<|emo_anger|> Can I just tell you how much I've enjoyed your constant dunking on this guy? Like holy crap.
<|emo_sad|> It never ends well
<|emo_anger|> That's a really cheap cop-out for rather common criticism of those games.
<|emo_surprise|> You can wait ten years to start working on yourself and get what you want or you can do it now.
<|emo_fear|> Nah no one can help me
<|emo_anger|> Damn don’t sell this
"<|emo_joy|> Oh, sweet. It's the gaming guy who hasn't uploaded any gaming videos yet! /s (I like him and am just poking fun)"
<|emo_anger|> Damn this is dope
"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, the video is a lot worse than I thought. His actions after he asks for the age is very uncomfortable. "
<|emo_anger|> Why did you post my autobiography
<|emo_joy|> so glad we picked this guy up. was absolutely terrified when we played against him. dude was in the zone.
"<|emo_sad|> Find a tv show to participate in, bat your eyes, cry a little. "
<|emo_joy|> No problem. Glad you were able to take something away from that.
<|emo_sad|> Having this issue as well it really does me in
<|emo_joy|> Lucky I caught people reacting on twitter. For some reason I thought this game as at 6 PM.
<|emo_fear|> I don't know why this image bothers me so much
"<|emo_joy|> c'mon OP, I know you would have liked to see that"
<|emo_fear|> OH [NAME] THAT'S TERRIFYING SOMEBODY SAVE US ^/s
"<|emo_anger|> I'd give them a first, but they have to retain salary. You know they'll just destroy that first round pick too."
<|emo_joy|> Happy cake day mothafucka
<|emo_joy|> Yes my man
<|emo_anger|> Fuck I’m sitting in position 3 right now
"<|emo_disgust|> Happy Abortion, Everybody!"
<|emo_anger|> Fuck I love you prag
<|emo_surprise|> Hardly surprising. Now they also lost their coach... rip
<|emo_fear|> I regret this post so hard so much debate and anger lol
<|emo_anger|> They killed me [NAME]. They killed me with schlock
<|emo_joy|> Oh ok cool so I don't feel bad at all about it then.
"<|emo_sad|> Siri ""calling mom would be sad"""
<|emo_anger|> This happens all too much. The game cannot keep up with so many actions especially if ur ping is bad
"<|emo_sad|> Not only does the overbooking hurt the customers financials and time, but violations like this one put lives in danger."
"<|emo_joy|> I reallllly loved the show. It disturbed me a lot, definitely. But I want more now."
<|emo_surprise|> I'm actually surprised it stayed up. We already got a shitpost thread yesterday. I though the limit was one per week.
<|emo_joy|> He probably enjoyed it so much with his frat brothers that he's willing to buck his own party for good weed.
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] was dork anyway. Be happy he ain't our hero.
"<|emo_sad|> Definitely not the norm in KY or other bible belt states, sadly. My extended family looks upon my CF lifestyle with nothing but bingo's."
"<|emo_joy|> Gettysburg is awesome, I've been twice. I want to go back as an adult! Have fun!"
<|emo_joy|> The carpool part!! The beauty of kids haha
<|emo_joy|> it’s what i would have wanted if i was a parent so yeah i’m glad i did something
"<|emo_sad|> Honestly, the fact that they're over and done didn't truly hit me until I saw that they now have a Greatest Hits album."
<|emo_disgust|> They can't even really articulate what has been so bad since [NAME] took office.
<|emo_anger|> That must be so frustrating. Sounds like he’s digging his heels in and refusing to accept his faults.
<|emo_sad|> This is so cruel. I literally feel physically sick.
<|emo_fear|> I was afraid of that .
"<|emo_sad|> Im at the game,somebody please put me out of my misery "
"<|emo_disgust|> 100% agree. Double standards are ever present. Young girl is sexualised, the whole world goes nuts, but a young boy is somehow perfectly acceptable. It's disgusting. "
<|emo_joy|> I haven’t seen this format before. And I don’t even know if it’s original. But I like it.
<|emo_disgust|> Edited because my kneejerk response was kind of unnecessarily harsh. :/
"<|emo_anger|> Because you're not making one in any coherent way. As such, I'm done. "
"<|emo_sad|> I’m finding lots of tribes here, thankfully. Between [NAME] and a narc mom & sister, I am extra screwed."
<|emo_anger|> He said some facts and you accused him for being 50c. From his tone you can't even tell he's a supporter of CPC.
<|emo_joy|> I gotta try that with my posse next time I’m on. That’s hilarious
"<|emo_anger|> You said an untrue thing. Own up to it, asshole."
<|emo_joy|> Aww a homophone on top of everything else. No wonder you carry a gun. You’re a coward who’s afraid of the world.
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad :)
"<|emo_sad|> Eesh, really sorry for your loss."
<|emo_surprise|> Look at the spine on that kid - he must get it from his mother!
<|emo_disgust|> one of them shotting 22lr if I recall? Heck most the worst used a pistol ether exclusively or with a shotty too
"<|emo_anger|> Well he abused his previous girlfriend, he ran a porn site that's what I know"
<|emo_surprise|> why is this hard to believe it’s totally believable
"<|emo_joy|> Cheers, [NAME]!"
"<|emo_surprise|> That's some creepy coincidence, then! Maybe I'll find my Donut twin on here one day! 😮 One can only hope..."
<|emo_joy|> Happy birthday! Enjoy your day and [NAME] should close this out as a present :)
<|emo_joy|> I believe you copied and paste from somewhere or previous answer. We are definitely not talking about the same thing. Hope you get better man. Cheers.
<|emo_disgust|> This is nasty NSFW
"<|emo_surprise|> Well, this is the first time I've seen that in over three years."
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh look, it's alive. Who here secretly fed it?"
<|emo_fear|> Confirmation sounds really scary and sketchy. I can not not think about cults and rituals everytime...
"<|emo_anger|> I would not be that mad though. Just disappointed. I am angry at people like you, not the show in itself."
<|emo_joy|> I love how serious and mad cats get when the dog starts messing around with them all playful
"<|emo_surprise|> wow, you guys have a body language now?"
<|emo_joy|> I had a feeling...crazy what that guy can do to his body.
<|emo_surprise|> ahh yes I forgot to include steps 3a *and* 3b. thanks fam
"<|emo_anger|> I just realized, what point are you trying to argue here? Because I have no idea where you're trying to go with this conversation."
"<|emo_anger|> I bet he paid, AND requested this masterpiece "
"<|emo_fear|> Yes, I've had this fear. It's even worse when you *don't* say goodbye and then it's the last time you see them."
<|emo_anger|> I hate it and I love it.
"<|emo_surprise|> My god, [NAME]!"
"<|emo_anger|> > Mother wasn't amused and I was forced to smile and bare it Wow, I would hate taking nude family portraits"
<|emo_anger|> That specific block is probably one of the worst in the city.
<|emo_sad|> Unemployed now re: those crummy health issues. So that probably helped.
<|emo_joy|> I'm so glad my dog hasn't figured out how to jump the 6' fence.
"<|emo_joy|> If you feel like venting, I am happy to listen."
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] aside, humans arent on the menu, no matter how retarded they may be, no matter if they're sleeping/unconscious."
"<|emo_disgust|> It's a lot of projection. Pretty much anything they point fingers at others for, is something they're guilty of."
<|emo_fear|> Unhhh has not been funny for a while now. This is definitely a terrible idea.
"<|emo_fear|> That's what I'm speaking purely about. We can only speculate. And oh, yeah, still quality cringe."
<|emo_fear|> oh [NAME] I unleashed the beast
"<|emo_disgust|> Going through this, tonight, right now, and it SUCKS"
"<|emo_anger|> I hear ya man, it sucks that we live in a world where we have to worry about so much nonsense instead of just being ourselves. "
<|emo_joy|> I will GLADLY tell him to his face. And have.
"<|emo_joy|> Its actually ""[NAME]"" , not ""[NAME]"".. Sounds like a drunk to me. Glad to hear nothing horrible happened "
"<|emo_surprise|> Agreed 100%, Governor [NAME] will have some say in this, they broke Wisconsin law, plain and simple !"
"<|emo_disgust|> Sanctions are immoral and don't do anything but cause more human suffering, disappointing to see that this sub will support them, but not really a shock. "
<|emo_fear|> They'll just move. There is no amount of enforcement that will change that. The United States isn't the only nice place to live.
<|emo_anger|> “No no no no spit that out right now!”
<|emo_joy|> Aw :(
<|emo_anger|> You left out information to serve your needs. How [NAME] of you.
<|emo_sad|> True Story! That's the sad Part of it...
<|emo_sad|> I'm so sorry. Read about you getting kicked out at home. That must be devastating
<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised no one posted a Meat thread yet...
<|emo_anger|> This sounds like disgusting wasp propaganda. You're being paid by Big Wasp aren't you? Confess!
<|emo_fear|> This is horrifying
<|emo_anger|> I hate roundabouts. For some reason road designers have a fetish for them as more and more are popping up. For cyclist they are rings of death
<|emo_anger|> and now her mask is on. make up yer mind
<|emo_anger|> horse meat is fucking peng i love it. why is it ok for a cow to be slaughtered for food but not a horse? ridiculous double standards
"<|emo_anger|> But this was a supposed psychopath attack, which can happen to anyone, not a rape attack that mostly happens to women"
<|emo_surprise|> I mean...that’s quite obvious. I’m just left wondering what the other item is. 2/10
<|emo_joy|> *pokes head in from Detroit* Hi! *waves!*
"<|emo_sad|> Thanks for saying that, but yeah: you really need to do something about your boy there. He’s not right."
<|emo_surprise|> This is not a comedy subreddit. It is a subreddit about the unexpected.
<|emo_surprise|> Omg it’s like you’re taking the words from my mind.
<|emo_fear|> I heard [NAME] was an absolute monster too... Jk folks
<|emo_joy|> Oh wow Thats definitely something
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] doesn't seem to have based this on anything. The owner of the nightclub says there was no altercation at
<|emo_joy|> I can be hard on KAT at times but boy am I glad he signed here for 5 more years
"<|emo_sad|> Poor kitty. All you can do is give her extra treats, playtime and cuddles. "
<|emo_sad|> Damn ive been hard on brown but he's been looking like 15-16 [NAME] this game
<|emo_surprise|> I always thought filet mignon had bacon and garlic butter. Colour me surprised Deliberately ignoring anything to do with the minion
<|emo_anger|> Can confirm. My forehead creases came from doing this for years.
<|emo_disgust|> Yup. Was so annoyed to see this making the rounds yesterday.
"<|emo_anger|> No, the full video shows that the kids surrounded and berated the native elder man "
<|emo_sad|> Oh man that title hurt my brain.
<|emo_disgust|> I’m far to antisocial or have too much contempt for other people to do something like that
<|emo_sad|> that was so sad :(
<|emo_anger|> I can guarantee you for many the hate for this administration started much before the election results were in.
<|emo_sad|> I'm one of those students on odsp. I'm screwed.
<|emo_disgust|> Upon reading I find this to be fake news and I'm disgusted to learn she writes for the age
<|emo_joy|> At no point in that ridiculous tantrum did he express a single iota of concern for what his gf wanted. He sounds like a real winner
<|emo_fear|> Oi he got stabbed in the eye
<|emo_anger|> He is a moron.
"<|emo_disgust|> Yea true , it sucks that theater mode doesn’t work its broken as hell in this game "
<|emo_disgust|> Looks like you clipped my own games. It’s bad lately.
"<|emo_disgust|> Tbh I've never found the porn ads arousing, I've usually found them annoying, stupid, really clickbaity, or hilariously cheesy"
<|emo_joy|> Glad to hear. It seems like a very hopeful sign. 👍
<|emo_anger|> It is a highly underappreciated movie...FOOLS
"<|emo_sad|> There’s a fine line between love and hate, you know. "
"<|emo_sad|> Haha sorry, I make hip hop music 😂"
<|emo_surprise|> I've always wondered how much of this stuff doesn't end up on the internet
<|emo_disgust|> Tkachuk - Pageau - Stone is going to be our second line. Absolutely filthy.
<|emo_anger|> I despise [NAME] and all his cronies
<|emo_sad|> Monthly blood loss totaling 9-12 oz on average. That and never being able to feel safe.
<|emo_anger|> Can the mods just delete this crap
<|emo_disgust|> The shame of it is if it weren't for bwood it would be a LOT worse.
<|emo_joy|> Happy Cakeday! I met my partner of 6 years at a London [NAME] meet-up 🤩
"<|emo_joy|> I can only download games using SteamCMD at work at the moment, so yeah, glad I could buy it before the shutdown"
<|emo_anger|> It’s a shame really... ruining a perfectly good shirt like that
"<|emo_sad|> Oh right. I can probably google it. I’m sure it’s in horrible taste, but I’m like dying to know now"
"<|emo_anger|> I'm not vegan cause I love animals, I'm vegan cause I hate myself. "
<|emo_anger|> Don't do #4 it's bullshit
<|emo_fear|> The shocking conclusion.
"<|emo_sad|> I couldn't get my wife on board. She insists on eating a ""real dinner""."
<|emo_anger|> I wish I didn’t fall for my ex. He is not a beautiful person. He is a monster.
<|emo_fear|> For the night is dark and full of terrors!
<|emo_anger|> Wow. I could have gone my entire life without witnessing this limpdicked haemorrhoid rank the severity of sexual assault based on who the victim is.
<|emo_disgust|> Kor Is an absolute chad
<|emo_sad|> I'm so sorry. Read about you getting kicked out at home. That must be devastating
<|emo_sad|> i also cried
"<|emo_disgust|> Well, I knew that a lot of people don't trim their bushes in the eastern suburbs, but that's ridiculous."
<|emo_anger|> Fucking refs suck my balls.
<|emo_sad|> That could have gone extremely badly for all involved.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME]. [NAME] and [NAME] just style on these scrubs with fucking mecha Tai Chi.
<|emo_surprise|> Shocked basement leaking got you freakin lady
"<|emo_anger|> Well attention whores are women(mostly) that always seek validation from other people, something that can really become very obnoxious and annoying."
"<|emo_sad|> Slowing down does not equal stopping, the answer to stopping this is at a government level, not praying that corporations want to leave possible profits alone."
<|emo_disgust|> Tbh the floor is probably more comfortable than the seats. Doesn't make it safe though.
<|emo_sad|> This should be the norm instead of the exception. Sadly the leaders in law enforcement are almost always more into politics than principles.
"<|emo_anger|> The state should kill them yes, you seem to have a very low IQ and can’t grasp [RELIGION]. No wonder you took up Reddit Atheism"
<|emo_sad|> I can’t stand [NAME] but that was heartbreaking
<|emo_joy|> Ayee it made it ! Enjoy
"<|emo_sad|> Oh my bad, i didn't know, thanks for telling me!"
<|emo_joy|> This made me chuckle
<|emo_joy|> Lol! I’m glad you feel lucky because you are! Could you imagine dealing with the continuous flipping back and forth between desire and guilt? 😬
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that landlady sure is a piece of shit. I'd be interested in knowing how many people she has discriminated against or harassed in the past."
"<|emo_sad|> Darn. I'm sorry, I didn't know that. I honestly am out of ideas and I don't know what to do."
"<|emo_sad|> What a loser, sad. "
"<|emo_disgust|> Could be worse, could be funky town"
"<|emo_anger|> Or more aptly ""OHHHHH FUUUUUuuuck"" As you see me run away."
"<|emo_joy|> FANTASTIC, was watching this episode last night. [NAME] is great."
<|emo_sad|> I'm baffled
<|emo_anger|> You don't really work for the TSA if they aren't paying you. You are a slave. Go home.
"<|emo_anger|> The alternative to [NAME] didn't inspire any passion in anyone, and greed, illiberalism and self-centeredness isn't confined to any ethnic group."
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that's quite a depressing article. I agree with points being made, but slow down with the doom and gloom."
<|emo_anger|> Yeah. I killed them both.
<|emo_anger|> Hate to see him go. The only thing I’m complaining about besides this was the hagelin trade back in November. Both hit home
<|emo_disgust|> Damn that was ugly
"<|emo_disgust|> I don’t really have much to say. There’s a bad idea, and there’s straight up disgusting."
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, thanks whoever did the silver❣ put a ray of sunshine into an otherwise cloudy day! "
"<|emo_surprise|> Way to cherry pick. Remember that time that [NAME] person got lit up for like, 9 goals against or something? Man, that guy sure sucked."
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] and [NAME]. There really is NO point of them staying and they are unbearable to watch.
"<|emo_sad|> Thats awful, I'm so sorry for your loss"
<|emo_sad|> Sorry to be the bearer of bad news
<|emo_surprise|> I think they were just doing their job. Reporting what they saw. And yea that was the happiest I have seen [NAME]. Weird.
<|emo_surprise|> Me too!!!
<|emo_disgust|> That's the opposite of a bad thing.
<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit! Did not see that coming! Gonna miss you [NAME] :(
<|emo_joy|> It would be hilarious if it was a pasta place too
<|emo_fear|> Please no hate it’s my first post bro please
"<|emo_anger|> Blow me you feckless moron, I was out of state. "
<|emo_joy|> You must be fun at parties.
"<|emo_joy|> cool, gonna check this game now"
"<|emo_anger|> Shut up, [NAME]. "
<|emo_fear|> Not threatening? It is an exhortation to commit a violent sexual act against a woman.
"<|emo_joy|> I am glad that you’re doing well, it’s a difficult process but incredibly rewarding, I imagine. Best of luck on your journey! "
<|emo_joy|> No need to apologize. It definitely put things in perspective. I’m just glad your DD ended up ok.
<|emo_fear|> True enough. I'd love more LGBT friendly horror.
"<|emo_joy|> Yeah, as a [NAME] id love to see the two biggest talents of Mexico and the US play together "
"<|emo_joy|> This makes me so happy, having a step parent can be a sensitive thing but you are definitely a good example of what to do, congrats!"
"<|emo_joy|> For you, the day the bison frolicked in the snow was the cutest time in your life, but for me...it was Tuesday. "
"<|emo_sad|> I was like you man, 3 felt so bad. But street part 4 3 becomes a so bad it's hilarious imo."
"<|emo_disgust|> Oh you're getting trolls trolls. Damn what sub you think they are getting you from, lol I'm not gonna mess with them."
<|emo_joy|> Oh [NAME] imagining this tween screaming yaaass queen at a poor drag queen made me cringe into a ball
<|emo_joy|> Happy birthday [NAME] !
<|emo_joy|> I'm mad at the process and happy with the results for Thrill tonight.
<|emo_surprise|> I feel like I'm watching a scene in an action movie but with penguins
"<|emo_joy|> what a lovely gift, you are blessed my friend, she picked you!!!! use it in good health"
<|emo_sad|> Nooooooooo I was a student staff member at the WCC and this makes me so sad and angryyyyy
<|emo_sad|> And the problem is that they took doctors out of a&e and out patients and community services and gp's to pay for his monstrosity...
"<|emo_joy|> I'm watching the Kings broadcast, and let me say [NAME] doing play by play is entertaining."
<|emo_joy|> Let me admit. This show is a guilty pleasure. Seeing these people's lives in such chaos brings me joy.
"<|emo_surprise|> From ""woohoo!!"" to blood curdling screams in a matter of seconds."
<|emo_sad|> I've invested 9 goddamn years watching these twits. I'm going down with the ship.
<|emo_sad|> The tone is damning
<|emo_fear|> It's the universe trying to kill us with radiation :D
"<|emo_anger|> ah so youre the guy who shows up to the party with one goal, to yell at people when they don’t play by his own rules"
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] damn it [NAME].
<|emo_joy|> Absolutely amazing how people think this is anonymous.
<|emo_fear|> On PS4 it's very toxic. I would imagine it is the same over on Xbox One aswell
<|emo_fear|> Threats and promotion of violence
<|emo_disgust|> I'm gonna say that I hate Randazzo's because of their terrible icing. Haydel's is decent and ships.
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] doesn’t roll his ankle on a 🎾 in 2011 and we win a premiership imo
<|emo_sad|> Their fault for being so tasty
<|emo_joy|> Lol thanks for understanding that it's humor as a coping mechanism...there are some comments on here that don't seem to grasp the concept very well.
<|emo_anger|> You’re argument is so bad you’re now asking people to deny common sense because you can’t prove your point LOL super pathetic
<|emo_joy|> I mean New Orleans is really fun even with little to no drinking. I wouldn't want to live anywhere else.
<|emo_joy|> Interesting. I recognize way more of the 2019 names than I did from last year. Any hope that means I'm getting younger?!
<|emo_anger|> Can you fucking not
<|emo_sad|> Sadly I know lots of peeps that would find this dude hot. He has that LA 90’s Persian chic thing going for him
<|emo_fear|> I mean it would be borderline targeting in college football. It was a really egregious missed call.
<|emo_joy|> Woooooo theres the boeser we know and love
"<|emo_sad|> Oh wow, I feel bad for the parents, they had no idea"
<|emo_joy|> I'm happy to go without but if it's readily available then everyday.
<|emo_fear|> Worrying about [NAME] during a game is ridiculous. Especially when he's currently 6-11 from the field.
<|emo_joy|> Me too! First time in a couple of years!
<|emo_sad|> Most people don't believe I have aspergers because I look 'normal' everyone else just thinks I'm weird.
"<|emo_surprise|> Surprisingly, not a lot of people know though."
<|emo_joy|> No lol. It’s a personal preference.
<|emo_joy|> Glad things came out alright for you...
<|emo_surprise|> Also put icecream under the taco for a nice sundae suprise 👍
"<|emo_anger|> If they lightbulb doesn’t change then it’s racist, sexist, Nazi scum. Am democrat just playing along. "
"<|emo_fear|> This was posted at the exact same time as another guy posted it on here, and that scares me."
<|emo_joy|> Sold car almost two years ago.... no regrets and quality of life has actually improved.
<|emo_joy|> To each their own. I enjoy it for what it is
"<|emo_anger|> Honestly, Queen kinda sucks. Obvious they were ripping off My Chemical Romance."
<|emo_joy|> The [NAME] are all laughing at each other. They are divided. We need to strike them down while they are weak.
<|emo_joy|> Actually looks really fucking fun. Where can I do this?
<|emo_sad|> That’s very creepy and weird. Hopefully this pup was not being carted around with ulterior motives.
<|emo_sad|> Thank you. So many people out there that would rather be right and in a grave than swallow their pride and do the safer thing.
<|emo_fear|> Ambien your posts are delightful and I have such a hard core internet stranger crush on you.
<|emo_joy|> I hate the marvel stuff. I do love stuff like murder mountain and you. So that’s a hit for me in the last month.
<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised [NAME] didn't bust that dress open when she bent down to high [NAME]
<|emo_joy|> Haha. Yeah there is a vaccination now. When I was a kid my parents did the same thing. It hadn’t been developed yet.
<|emo_joy|> So happy for you both!
"<|emo_sad|> They seem to have very ""sick"" laws in Saudi Arabia. Where women don't have any protection from government against their perpetrators."
"<|emo_sad|> Trust me, if its a person you have feelings for and she/ he just wants your body, thats really painful."
<|emo_anger|> Making DC climate an unapologetic brutality with blistering dry winds and no snow on a typical day.
<|emo_sad|> Fuck my life
<|emo_anger|> Good. Stay the fuck away.
<|emo_sad|> This is so true cause I always think “are they just using me for sex?”
"<|emo_anger|> 22 points in 41 games with a pretty shitty Utica squad, first full year in NA... yeah I don’t want another Dahlen debacle "
<|emo_joy|> Not sure about “better” but women artists have an intuitive grasp of color theory and tend to use color in a more pleasing way.
<|emo_anger|> Because ridiculously attractive people also have self esteem issues and depression Guess what honey The world sucks for everyone There’s no escape We will all die in misery and alone
<|emo_sad|> I'M LITERALLY DEAD
<|emo_anger|> I was skeptical about it being huge but damn..
"<|emo_disgust|> Not to be critical, but “rethuglican” is an awful one "
<|emo_joy|> There it is!
"<|emo_anger|> They were not really messing around, just more frustrated. They genuinely were trying to move specialists around to get the best out of people."
"<|emo_sad|> Oh, sorry bud. Didnt mean to be rude"
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, sorry, bruh. I didn’t realize we were in the presence of genius. Please elaborate."
"<|emo_joy|> I mean I dont think your wrong at all, but I would still be happy to fight you for funsies."
<|emo_sad|> It's sad that we have to think of it as a miracle and not a regular occurrence :/
<|emo_anger|> I would say make it NSFW but I won't joke. We don't work here
"<|emo_surprise|> Important part of this, surprising it's not there. "
"<|emo_anger|> If I'm enjoying some fresh produce, and I hear you say >app-uh-LAY-sha Rest assured im throwing this apple at'cha."
<|emo_joy|> I like [NAME].
"<|emo_sad|> It's ok, it was cancelled anyway"
"<|emo_sad|> It would hilarious, but also kind of sad."
<|emo_joy|> This is so sweet. Thank you for being an awesome parent !
<|emo_joy|> Love how they all claim no one pays any attention to the comments then acknowledge a comment section personality.
<|emo_disgust|> I don't know why that omni-directional treadmill in Ready Player One still isn't being mass produced.
<|emo_sad|> I genuinely teared up when I heard it in the game
<|emo_joy|> Hard to believe we scored like 8 points through the first 6 minutes.
<|emo_sad|> Real-life goblin checking in. It’s very demoralizing.
<|emo_joy|> such a cute boy!
<|emo_disgust|> Bisbee is a weird place.
<|emo_disgust|> Whiskey isn't going to help. She should pray to [NAME] that another man comes and brings purpose to her life.
<|emo_surprise|> Right? I’ve never heard of it being made with French dressing.
<|emo_fear|> Logging is pretty dangerous.
<|emo_sad|> Im sorry I said something negative about your beloved Valve.
<|emo_anger|> I said stop though. What’s with right wingers and not understanding consent?
<|emo_joy|> Same here. My refund almost doubled from last year. I almost cried when I saw how much I'm getting back.
<|emo_joy|> I usually see tweets like this for girls but it feels nice to have it directed at boys
<|emo_surprise|> Tiki Lounge always smells like sewage. I'm surprise it's lasted this long.
<|emo_joy|> Always happy to help
"<|emo_sad|> Ouch, my heart. I never even thought about this..."
<|emo_anger|> annoyed at most
<|emo_sad|> and [NAME] got blessed with a LocationBot cat fact?! There is no justice in the world...
<|emo_anger|> This is either beautiful..or just about the stupidest thing I've read in weeks. Here's hoping for fantastic satire!
<|emo_sad|> The hardest part is trying to figure out what anyone is talking about with all these F degrees.
"<|emo_disgust|> Weird, FBI did an investigation and proved that never happened. White knights make me cringe."
<|emo_sad|> Bringing the country down with the government.
<|emo_disgust|> But OP said her life is ruined because 'muricans are bad.
<|emo_anger|> Oh hell yeah
"<|emo_surprise|> Omg that sounds like a really intense experience, how'd you save yourself after the feeling of intense happiness? "
<|emo_surprise|> I can't imagine it's going to be easy to come to the realization that your parents murdered your brother.
"<|emo_sad|> Dude I don’t even know what that guys deal is, but honestly, I feel bad for him"
<|emo_surprise|> omg that was full on Tequila [NAME]!!!
"<|emo_anger|> It's like 20,000 words about a teenager. Fucking insanity."
<|emo_anger|> Shaming men for trying to solve a problem on their own is actually an example of toxic femininity
<|emo_anger|> Zionism is the ISIS of [RELIGION]. Brainwashed idiots like ISIS.
<|emo_joy|> They both crazy
<|emo_surprise|> Surprised [NAME] didn't add his hatred of interracial couples in the movie.
"<|emo_sad|> As a fellow browns fan, unfortunate enough to be born into a browns family and in ohio... Hello sharer of a lifetime of heartbreak."
<|emo_anger|> Taliban is the worst.
"<|emo_joy|> Funk Night @ Marble Bar is Friday, 1/25. Always a good time and only $5 to get in."
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, foot and car traffic downtown has changed a ton in just 8 years. "
<|emo_disgust|> Perfect example of the disgusting misuse of ‘Orwellian’ on this website
<|emo_joy|> Not sure how you got that outta my post. I play a lot of non-meta stuff all the time just because I find it fun or challenging.
"<|emo_sad|> The irony is, she's probably been wishing for death for far longer."
<|emo_joy|> Agreed. A case where we're both right. Cheers!
<|emo_joy|> That logo looks cool in the morning lol almost cyperpunk
<|emo_anger|> Now that I've gone solar I'll never go back
<|emo_surprise|> This is a restaurant in a hotel so it had a strange vibe.
"<|emo_sad|> Spoiler alert, it's terrifying and depressiong"
<|emo_sad|> Bags are packed. Have to leave the country at a minimum as it's one of those gyms that's all over the place. Bad times.
<|emo_fear|> Problem is that picture is there before you ever set foot in the cabin; [NAME] put it there. Just makes it creepy.
<|emo_joy|> Are you actually serious? I'm really interested in the details lol
"<|emo_anger|> Ya know, I hate lying but I guess I'd make an exception for this. "
<|emo_disgust|> You're not a good person if you make the person that just let you inside their body feel bad and disrespected.
"<|emo_disgust|> Mob mentality makes it worse. Four man SWF groups are generally, by far, the most toxic people in the game. "
<|emo_joy|> I'm liking the bums
<|emo_sad|> I’m sorry where is that?
<|emo_anger|> Wow! Good for her! I’m so glad she was able to see through the bullshit!
"<|emo_anger|> Slap her hand if she is trying to force you to do anything! Tell her not to put her hands on you, and enforce it every time. "
<|emo_joy|> Beast milk. My favourite!
<|emo_disgust|> It's like an instinct for idiots to downvote without even reading a comment first if they sense the word vegan in it haha
<|emo_sad|> I'm sad I had to come this far down to find this.
"<|emo_sad|> if dxm is causing this problem for you, don't ever abuse oxy's or hydros... you won't piss for days 😅😅😅"
"<|emo_disgust|> I'm saying [NAME] is the pretentious one, and that the original commenter's response to him is a perfect mockery of the asshole "
<|emo_joy|> oh okay gotcha! i was really baffled at that lol
<|emo_sad|> DONT RUIN THIS FOR ME
<|emo_joy|> Sorry if I’m late to the party but when does the new season start? I’m getting withdrawals! Happily ever after that is.
<|emo_surprise|> It’s a wonder [NAME] didn’t get more duis with the amount he needed to drink
"<|emo_sad|> I was always in awe of just how stunning she was. She doesn't photograph well though, it's a shame. "
<|emo_disgust|> Guice was a fuckin monster.
<|emo_anger|> This argument makes zero sense. The same tax exclusions and exemptions that were around when the marginal rate was at 90 are not around today.
"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, I thought the same"
<|emo_joy|> It's like muricans don't want to protect their own jobs and are happy to become low-wage dump and burn workers for the owning class.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gawd. WHAT?
<|emo_disgust|> Franz Ferdinand are awful too
<|emo_surprise|> OMG this Extreme Love commercial. Yikes.
<|emo_disgust|> This is so cute and wholesome? How is this terrible
<|emo_anger|> Damn [NAME] is KILLING it
<|emo_anger|> Dude was using his power and leadership to exploit women. This is gross.
<|emo_surprise|> I'm honestly surprised. We should have fallen much farther
<|emo_sad|> Eso me cae bien. I was just thinking that contending to make the playoffs in a few years was a depressingly low goal.
"<|emo_sad|> Right there with you! Unladylike was so depressing, I couldn't keep listening to it."
<|emo_sad|> oh i don’t want to bother anyone with my pathetic problems
"<|emo_fear|> But terrible people is my ""type"""
"<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry you fell for the carnie, bro."
"<|emo_sad|> Oh gosh, I'm so sorry you had to deal with that. It sounds like you handled it really well. Kids are cruel. "
<|emo_anger|> Sticking a road in the middle of someone's land just to satisfy your OCD seems pretty cruel.
"<|emo_anger|> ""Get the fuck out of the fucking chair"", or something to that avail."
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] was the same in Crestwood. Scary as hell.
<|emo_disgust|> It definitely doesn't work if you give up.
<|emo_sad|> I heard the ostrich was sick.
<|emo_anger|> These honestly are getting infuriating. The creator of this made this whole thing up yet Facebook old people take it as reality.
<|emo_disgust|> Humans are weird creatures
"<|emo_joy|> Nah man you need to have NEGATIVE IQ to enjoy that show, cuz the weed ain't working."
<|emo_anger|> Oh *hell* no.
"<|emo_sad|> Thank you, and same to you. I was a single AP once, it was lonely. Do you see other people?"
<|emo_fear|> Hers are just terrible. I’ve seen the look great on other people.
"<|emo_anger|> How dare you interrupt the circle jerk. Out, sir."
"<|emo_disgust|> Well, at least she broke up first. It would somehow be worse if she kept it hidden and brought him the news later"
<|emo_anger|> Delete your account.
<|emo_sad|> It is genuinely hard to imagine what the Magic basketball experience will be like when these two legends are no longer in their roles.
<|emo_disgust|> Except [NAME] is worse
"<|emo_surprise|> I go to the same hairdresser as [NAME], and she told me we were interested. Dunno how she got her info though."
<|emo_disgust|> Well she’s still kind of awful but she’s hilarious. Definitely a huge improvement. I could barely watch her!!
<|emo_anger|> Wtf is that
"<|emo_anger|> Thanks, I hate it. They're out now though."
<|emo_disgust|> Damn liberals!
<|emo_joy|> Not worth it. My family is the same way. I am scapegoat. I cut them all off and I have never been happier or more at peace
<|emo_anger|> Well then why are some people allowed to talk about strip clubs here and others are not?
"<|emo_joy|> There have been some really good replies in this thread, I hope they help you too! :)"
"<|emo_anger|> Wow that is one part disgusting and another part a huge waste of time for expecting an entertaining payoff. Warning, this video also includes spoilers for the latest Avengers."
<|emo_anger|> I hate you.
<|emo_sad|> I’m sorry this happened to you. I’m glad you got out of it.
"<|emo_fear|> I am so upset for you and your family. She knew what she was doing, which makes this even more horrifying."
"<|emo_fear|> Pretty terrifying. Imagine if you went on a school trip, did nothing, and came home to this."
<|emo_sad|> Oh I should've checked there wow I'm slow 🤦
"<|emo_disgust|> Judging by my 10 month old, that is about 2.5 days worth of dirty diapers. "
"<|emo_sad|> I’m sorry men, I have failed you. My rigidity was no match for the flaccid effort our boys showed tonight"
<|emo_anger|> I reported an old man for terrible driving and the police actually took it seriously (pleasantly surprised). It's worth a try!
<|emo_joy|> I hope that the talk goes ok. Though with these justno's it may not. I'm glad that you are prepared if it goes south.
<|emo_surprise|> A 12 million sub channel has value. Wouldn't be surprised if it's been hollowed out ready to be sold and rebranded.
<|emo_joy|> I I'm so honored
"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] knocking [NAME] out. Somehow, I didn't expect the brainwashed soldier to betray the kids."
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, the video is a lot worse than I thought. His actions after he asks for the age is very uncomfortable. "
"<|emo_sad|> Glad he's still balling, better than [NAME] for sure. I would have liked to have kept him just cos I liked how hard he played. "
<|emo_sad|> I'm crying. Their faces 😂🤣😂
"<|emo_sad|> although he is best girl, he can never love :( he litterally doesn't have a heart"
"<|emo_surprise|> Eh, we all pay for sex one way or another. More power to you."
<|emo_sad|> God damn I miss this game!
<|emo_joy|> This was actually good until the bird came in.
<|emo_disgust|> He said “Guess he didn’t get the victory [NAME] :(“
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, really have to hand it to you on knowing 6600 S Harvard beautiful big old homes down there!"
<|emo_joy|> that's nice :)
<|emo_fear|> Oh true I remember seeing it on Spotify’s charts for weeks. It’s terrible.
"<|emo_disgust|> Just say that you don't like it. It tastes of blood, tears, and death."
<|emo_joy|> Sounds really boring so I hope you like it
<|emo_joy|> I actually like my vagina... I suspect it’s actually my husband that is the problem
<|emo_joy|> What a wonderful world you lot live in!
<|emo_anger|> You sure its not just the host quitting which disconnects everybody? Happens all the time and its incredibly frustrating.
"<|emo_joy|> I am generally a happy person. If you like to pay millions of dollars to semi-literates to represent your government, it's up to you!"
<|emo_anger|> What a fuckin n
<|emo_joy|> I think someone else should open a drive through so I can enjoy the flavours without the dishes aha
<|emo_disgust|> Bitch right!
<|emo_disgust|> This thread is one of worst things I've ever read
<|emo_disgust|> I got a bad feeling about this. Something tells me they're going to drag this along until 2 weeks before release.
"<|emo_joy|> I'm watching the Kings broadcast, and let me say [NAME] doing play by play is entertaining."
<|emo_surprise|> Wonder how that brother or cousin excuse works when Lus have no brothers or male cousins
"<|emo_anger|> How dare you interrupt the circle jerk. Out, sir."
<|emo_anger|> The best way is killing people that don't know you. Also you could steal some things so the cops think that it was a robbery
<|emo_sad|> i feel betrayed by the community
<|emo_joy|> This. Making my animals happy is one of the only things that makes me happy.
<|emo_anger|> Science damn you!
"<|emo_joy|> Let's keep making that trade with different teams until we have all 32 picks in the 6th round one year Sorry, I'll go back to my NHL19"
<|emo_disgust|> What a heartless person lol
<|emo_anger|> I don’t care about the first seed until a week or so before the all star cut off?
"<|emo_joy|> Amazing, I would also be deeply in love. So happy for you Hun. Enjoy every bit💕💕"
<|emo_sad|> Damn I’d be worth more taken apart and put in ice than I am put together and living
"<|emo_fear|> I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced."
<|emo_disgust|> That cat's jump when the coyote takes his eyes off him.. Ouch!
<|emo_joy|> Im glad to hear it !!!
<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst I've ever seen. It really is
<|emo_sad|> Reality is often disappointing
<|emo_sad|> Well it very well could be your drug usage. You could be depressed also. So stop doing drugs and see a therapist.
<|emo_joy|> I'm excited!
"<|emo_sad|> If it's anything like what happened in France, I'd assume because it disproportionately affects the poor. "
<|emo_fear|> I died a little inside watching all of that champagne go to waste.
<|emo_disgust|> This is wack
"<|emo_sad|> I’m here,it’s tough but I’m here."
"<|emo_sad|> He was injured in real life, watch the news. He'll be back in ep 15 and fully recovered."
<|emo_surprise|> This looks amazing omg!!
"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] passing is worse than usual. It's alright, but god damn is it painful to watch."
<|emo_surprise|> Oh man I was being facetious It annoyed me so much
<|emo_joy|> Happy Birthday!
<|emo_disgust|> Wtf the dude is 29? Seemed like only yesterday he was the most hyped goalie prospect in the world...
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is worse but biden gropes women and little girls
<|emo_anger|> Holy fuck [NAME]!
<|emo_anger|> Uh... What's stopping you from just throwing it away?
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah this bothers me. Family should be off limits, and this scene was really sad"
"<|emo_sad|> I'm sad, but I just want a new Metroid game, and if this is what it takes to make it great then I understand"
<|emo_anger|> Worst advice ever. This would piss me off.
"<|emo_sad|> @lies_about_flossing, sorry if I used the wrong pronoun."
"<|emo_surprise|> 35k? That's just crazy. Mine was less than 2k, and that includes the wedding dress."
<|emo_sad|> Sorry man. Didn't realize I was talking to a Russian spam bot. Please give my best to [NAME].
<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised he didn't say it was *almost* an inside job
<|emo_fear|> Can't stand having sex with you...?? Just horrible thing to say... You deserve better!!!
"<|emo_disgust|> Damn you, [NAME]. I’m a woman and yours are bigger than mine. It’s not fair!"
"<|emo_joy|> Hey, remember when [NAME] said furries are all catfuckers? Glad he's changed since then."
<|emo_disgust|> You like [NAME] but dislike [NAME]? That is weird considering that they both are on the same low level of intelligence.
<|emo_anger|> Yeah wat a fucking knob right? Fucking nick...
"<|emo_sad|> Oh don't get me wrong, there's a lot else wrong with comparing teachers to huns besides what I said."
<|emo_surprise|> Wow what a fucking autist. Probably more effort into this shit than all people that hate on GS combined.
<|emo_anger|> You don't know what fact is?
"<|emo_joy|> Yeah, too many blind assumptions. I'm just happy that we're getting four additional characters to pad the roster with."
<|emo_anger|> Now put the poor thing down you valley boy donut.
"<|emo_fear|> They believed in themselves, and clutched up. Let’s get it"
"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], not sure why my original thread discussing it was deleted"
<|emo_anger|> FUCKING READ IDIOT
<|emo_anger|> Fuckkkk those are 2009 prices. I’m guessing you’re out east!
"<|emo_sad|> You're just lonely, dude. Don't mix that feeling with love."
<|emo_joy|> Lol you know what makes me happy? All of your guys negativity. Keep it up everyone :) it just makes me happier
<|emo_anger|> Fake lous!
<|emo_disgust|> Omg is that cesspool where he lives?! Barf! 🤢🤢🤢🤢
"<|emo_disgust|> yeah, fuck [NAME]"
<|emo_sad|> I know! Or close the door of the room where the baby is sleeping? It's too sad for the poor thing to be locked inside.
<|emo_joy|> Ya! It was a bangin’ movie! A super fun ride with characters I cared about.
<|emo_disgust|> I love him even though the newest season of t@gged kinda sucked.
<|emo_surprise|> My name is [NAME] too. It's so strange hearing my favorite bravolebs say it on TV.
<|emo_sad|> $100 says your boyfriend is miserable.
"<|emo_sad|> I was assaulted by my father once too. Please don’t hate yourself, it was not your fault. It was his doing. "
"<|emo_joy|> I’m sure losing obj will help [NAME] get out of his slump, or help develop whichever rookie qb they bring in. "
"<|emo_disgust|> Gross. I hate using those reusable cloth ones because they retain smells. You've got cats? I know, I can smell them. "
<|emo_anger|> Children taken below decks by [NAME]. Get out now
<|emo_disgust|> So every interaction with a dumb or crazy person is news?
<|emo_anger|> What. The. Fuck.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] doesn't get a vote [NAME]! Get the fuck out of here with this nonsense.
<|emo_anger|> it really sucks how absolutely fucked some of us got genetically in the chest department
<|emo_joy|> Oh I know. [RELIGION] is the most severe form of brainwashing on the planet. There’s absolutely nothing like it. It blows my mind.
<|emo_surprise|> > Wolf Hall Sounds interesting ! You've inadvertently led me down a rabbit hole of historical wikipedia pages now...
<|emo_joy|> TBH she kind of brought it on herself. I'm glad the GM came to his senses.
<|emo_anger|> Why do all the animals look terrifying oh god oh fuck
"<|emo_disgust|> In other words this looks bad, so we’re trying to distance ourselves from it. Yeah too bad NRA. Zero sympathy from here. "
<|emo_anger|> I wouldn't announce that they are LuLaRoe.
<|emo_sad|> I was 10 years old when this happened and seeing her heartbroken dad on tv and hearing her story still haunts me.
<|emo_surprise|> Surprisingly all of my family keep their toasters on the work top despite being [RELIGION]/Unionist ?
"<|emo_fear|> Me too, but glad this creep is getting attention for his creepiness outside of r/kanye"
<|emo_anger|> Ehhh but as a survivor I hate noed and hex ruin why would I run them against someone else
<|emo_sad|> I'm a danger to myself
<|emo_fear|> Oh there's still bugs? Weird
<|emo_joy|> Your nan and dad are both trash. I am so glad you were able to pull yourself up and rise above. 💕
<|emo_anger|> I could not agree with you more! These selfish women crying abuse to manipulate.
<|emo_joy|> Thank you.. Makes my heart happy that someone can appreciate this thread :)
"<|emo_joy|> From the post history, I'd say this looks like a highly inept karma farm bot account. Edit: OP is for real! Yay! Upvoting!"
<|emo_anger|> Duck fuck goose
"<|emo_joy|> Thanks, I understand what you mean, this made me feel better :)"
<|emo_joy|> This might be my favorite scene in the whole series
<|emo_disgust|> I mean... this is some shit right here
<|emo_joy|> We’re all bible on this blessed day
"<|emo_surprise|> Srsly, mountains in Netherlands?"
<|emo_fear|> I might be in trouble in this case. I have 7 years going on 8 :(
"<|emo_joy|> even though its alot of work, i got 100% this weekend, and that scene re-opened the wound, lemme tell ya. what a masterpiece"
<|emo_anger|> Now *I’M* angry
"<|emo_joy|> Yes, that was indeed the joke, I’m glad you got it ;)"
<|emo_disgust|> About fucking time ordering ASAP
<|emo_disgust|> Too right. I hate the Sun. worst tabloid out there
"<|emo_sad|> Honestly nothing, death is an awful part of life. The only thing that can do anything is time. Just never forget them."
<|emo_disgust|> Upon reading I find this to be fake news and I'm disgusted to learn she writes for the age
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah father of two T1D. That post is insanely reactionary. My lord.
<|emo_anger|> NEXT TIME! ON THE CURSE OF OAK ISLAND!
"<|emo_anger|> It looked like something on her etsy. Maybe I'm wrong, I just looked it up under her username"
<|emo_sad|> Aye the party left me. Now I'm stuck in with this old boys tadger staring me in the face.
"<|emo_disgust|> It's not something i'm proud of, but I definitely fucked up that day."
<|emo_joy|> I'm still happy about it and will be for the entire offseason.....if not longer :)
<|emo_sad|> I honestly couldn’t care less about your opinion at this point
"<|emo_anger|> I'm a Broncos fan. I'll never, ever root for the Chargers, Chiefs or Raiders. Who the fuck would? "
"<|emo_joy|> Thanks, glad you enjoyed it!"
"<|emo_sad|> I'm all for not getting too crazy because we've had a rough stretch, but [NAME] scoring twice hurt. A lot."
<|emo_joy|> my favourite kind of cookies.
"<|emo_joy|> A joke is subjective pal, second of all you need to mature/grow up and get a taste of the real world before giving your political opinions."
"<|emo_sad|> That's some animal cruelty right there, someone help this poor creature."
<|emo_sad|> I've found out speaking about our traumas is what heals us. Some people also need to hear our struggles to overcome theirs.
"<|emo_joy|> No, [NAME] is dating [NAME]"
<|emo_joy|> It's all fun and games until your crush turns into a spaceship.
<|emo_disgust|> Well that isn't fucking creepy.
<|emo_fear|> Of course he will lie cheat and steal to make him self relevant to the public. Horrible person.
<|emo_joy|> She has at least 12 elbows and all of them are happy. You get it gurl
<|emo_sad|> Randomly watched arrow this week and I think each year is more confusing and I didn't like it! At least [NAME] is still there and always shining!
<|emo_fear|> This is horrifying
"<|emo_fear|> I have seen this gif like once a week for a year, and I still cringe every time. "
<|emo_anger|> Hate people like this
<|emo_disgust|> I read it as him taking her virginity. Raping her...unless it was consensual and she WANTED to lose it.
<|emo_sad|> Outrage over something that isnt even true. Thats sad man Edit: well the bandwaggoning part is true
<|emo_anger|> oh shit u meant the actual post... yeh i live in china this all we got😂😂

<|emo_joy|> Slightly obscure I like it. I’ll add crash.
<|emo_surprise|> It was [NAME] I think? And I only remember because I was surprised and then disappointed.
"<|emo_joy|> Lucky, when I did it my nickname ended up being [NAME]"
"<|emo_surprise|> A surprise, but a welcome one"
<|emo_joy|> Thank you for that :) I'm not OP but I am really happy to read your comment.
"<|emo_sad|> Ok, I gots to know, was the child taken away? Please tell me the child was taken away. "
<|emo_anger|> Ugh. I just hate seeing this name :(
"<|emo_anger|> I'm not trying to intimidate you, just saying that what you are doing is wrong and illegal, and you should stop doing it."
"<|emo_anger|> r/mildlyinteresting's stupid ""guys look at this thing I made aren't I cool??"" posts are the absolute worst"
<|emo_disgust|> Why is she the absolute worst
<|emo_anger|> Black people still get shot unarmed. Comparing suffering is stupid and pointless.
<|emo_disgust|> I mean... this is some shit right here
<|emo_joy|> Ahahaha I’m enjoying your troll. Seriously remember commenting on it like a year ago. Hilarious people are still trying to correct you.
<|emo_joy|> He's been cheered for years now.
"<|emo_anger|> Racism is as racism does - so yeah, goin' out and willfully doing racist shit is indeed racist. Not too hard to grasp."
<|emo_anger|> But I hate trannies and feminsts owo
"<|emo_disgust|> too cold hurts my teeth, so i just drink whatever comes out of my sink"
<|emo_disgust|> Facial hair ability: [NAME] Looks like [NAME] got a bloody nose a week ago and hasn’t washed the blood out yet.
<|emo_fear|> It happens so much that it really scares me tbh.
<|emo_disgust|> Aghh bacon is actually the worst. The smell of it is soo disgusting you can smell the dirtiness
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] strange dreams. one life is enough
<|emo_disgust|> Aaaaaand they turned it off. Terrible roads everywhere.
<|emo_disgust|> I guess its the 9th largest city in the country but it it weird to group them together
<|emo_anger|> I didn’t misinterpret the comment. There are kids in the truck. Watch the video with sound.
<|emo_surprise|> Yes! I started it off on a lie! And?
"<|emo_joy|> Thank you! [NAME] is a character that means a lot to me, and it makes me happy that you like my portrayal of her."
<|emo_surprise|> OOGA BOOGA [NAME] BEHIND YOU LOOK OUT
<|emo_joy|> Have a lovely day.
<|emo_disgust|> New Title Idea : Man gets assaulted for voicing his (albeit awful and disgusting) opinion.
<|emo_joy|> Ew yes I’m glad you brought that up.
<|emo_anger|> u fucked up
"<|emo_sad|> it is very clearly incorrect, and it's apparent that your descent into reactionary politics has made you fully delusional. "
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, the interview with her mom really made that clip."
<|emo_joy|> Nice work as always dish.
<|emo_surprise|> Fucking hell they're bringing on all the giants
<|emo_joy|> I laughed so hard.
<|emo_fear|> TBH I was worried he actually hurt [NAME]. Glad everyone is ok.
<|emo_disgust|> They need a speedy guy to fish pucks.. Either get nylander or Hyman on that line.. [NAME] line deployment is brutal..
<|emo_sad|> This is painful
<|emo_surprise|> Most people don't believe I have aspergers because I look 'normal' everyone else just thinks I'm weird.
<|emo_joy|> I would enjoy this if it had a few more pixels.
"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, a 'bungle' given how scummy Restaurant Brands has been known to be. "
"<|emo_sad|> Oh, apologies. Silly me didn’t think to check the sub first."
<|emo_anger|> Mine used to tell „you complain too much“. I was also angry when I was with him. I‘m not like that.
<|emo_surprise|> Everybody talks about this but I wonder if it increases the chances of prostate cancer. Do you know?
<|emo_disgust|> Plead not guilty and try your luck in court.
<|emo_anger|> Shit out to my little hommies who's parents made them go to school today.
<|emo_sad|> Can we put down weed bro? He’s faced too much suffering.
"<|emo_surprise|> I’m surprised nyxl hasn’t done that with their overloaded dps roster, but a possible upcoming import limit might be the issue"
<|emo_joy|> I'm so delighted that my boyfriend has found this community.
"<|emo_surprise|> wow, there really is “somethin” for everyone ..."
"<|emo_joy|> How could I not? These actors...I love them. Their faces give me joy, hope. "
"<|emo_disgust|> Ew, this comment needs to die. Adultery is the most cowardly option you could ever pick."
"<|emo_disgust|> Yes, [NAME] is truly evil [NAME], his utter failure and stupidity is so beyond reason that when you mention it, it sounds beyond reason."
"<|emo_joy|> Well at this precise moment in time, you can drink more... that will remedy any feeling of being depressed. Hit the shots!"
<|emo_sad|> He is holding you hostage. Sad state of affairs.
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh I thought this was about the Pistons making the playoffs. Since I wasn't paying attention to them, I actually thought it was possible. Ahahahahaha!"
<|emo_sad|> Creepiest building in Chicago. I couldn’t even imagine the number of gunshot victims that have gone theough those doors and came out in a body bag.
"<|emo_joy|> YES [NAME], we're rooting for you! 🎉🎉"
<|emo_surprise|> That Moment when you suddenly find yourself in a 3 minute starring contest
<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit nice block [NAME]
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, how did a kid manage to eat a whole watermelon over the space of 47 hours!"
<|emo_anger|> Oh hell yeah
"<|emo_anger|> He ran as a [NAME] in the Senate primary and then declined the nomination. Multiple times. He isn't ""honoring"" shit."
<|emo_disgust|> Yea this past season her outfits were horrid
<|emo_anger|> Looks like you understand my language so let me try this You are so delusional and think u know everything but you don't
<|emo_surprise|> How is it racist? I fail to see how.
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah, and it was 20 years ago and now I feel really old."
<|emo_joy|> I wake up with a smile knowing that there are almost 5 billion WHAMEN to RESPECC in the world
<|emo_sad|> Not surprising since about 85% of all dating relationships end in a break up.
"<|emo_anger|> Vanity is a sin, [NAME] wants us to hate our bodies"
<|emo_anger|> I can't wait to find out why this is inaccurate and I should hate the person who made this post and shower them with downvotes.
<|emo_joy|> this is r/comedyheaven content alright. frick u i love it.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, great news bro!"
<|emo_surprise|> I hate to say it but....... I quite like this as a format - the burger and fries look shocking though.
<|emo_anger|> They shout it near the end. Listen for WAAAAAAALLLLLL
"<|emo_anger|> Ha, my husband goes out after you guys have done your thing and checks for himself, he's been burned too many times."
"<|emo_disgust|> Right, [NAME] here - ""tooting"" = fart or follow through? "
<|emo_anger|> This is infuriating but what’s also infuriating is missing all of our chances and players being constantly in offsides positions
<|emo_sad|> I wish I could cry...
"<|emo_surprise|> Exactly, or they thought he was saying it jokingly. The delusion these men live with continues to amaze me"
"<|emo_joy|> Yes!!!! Great weekend. As others have said, I can now enjoy the rest of the playoffs"
"<|emo_joy|> So happy for you! Keep dancing, dancing is freedom!! Something we feel we will never have again. "
"<|emo_joy|> I said to myself ""It's going to be reefer madness"" Clicked the link and it was Reefer Madness."
<|emo_fear|> This is scary to know that you went through. People like this are one step away from coming home with a gun or knife.
"<|emo_disgust|> Nope! His real name starts with a G. Weird spelling of a common name, and pretty identifiable so I’ve never wanted to use it 🙃"
<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I didn't even know there was a handball world championship.
<|emo_anger|> How dare you disparage a 3D printed JV riding a goddamn raptor
<|emo_fear|> This is scary and so very sad. Eleven??? A baby! I was still building forts. I weep for this child.
<|emo_joy|> And then everyone clapped and cheered.
<|emo_joy|> The amount of overreaction on this thread is too damn high!
"<|emo_sad|> It would hilarious, but also kind of sad."
<|emo_surprise|> shockingly close to reality.
"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah, I just visited there and it seems more disordered than this sub... Strange"
"<|emo_fear|> > So basically, if you're responsible with guns, you have nothing to worry about. I'm worried about *other people* not being responsible with guns."
"<|emo_anger|> You guys are heartless, smfh."
<|emo_anger|> U will hate it shortly
"<|emo_anger|> Agreed, rarely get mad at ones like hun or darl. Being called boy by an old man however is infuriating."
"<|emo_fear|> I’m sure she would love it, maybe she’s scared too!"
"<|emo_surprise|> Same here, after she initiated the divorce and acussed me of not doing anything to stop it. "
<|emo_joy|> Yup that game was where I was like we have to draft him!!!!!
"<|emo_sad|> ah thats my bad, she just finished the blog and im sharing it around, one sec and ill edit it. "
"<|emo_disgust|> worst case of life is unfortunately apt here, eh?"
"<|emo_anger|> ""You people""? I think [NAME] is a moron but I think the [NAME] hysteria is equally if not more so moronic."
"<|emo_joy|> Cheers, brother. What are you doing to meet women? "
<|emo_anger|> Imagine thinking that a rapist isn't deserving of prison. He's not even sorry.
"<|emo_fear|> You're probably right and how terrible of them, if so. Poor [NAME]."
"<|emo_anger|> At the time it was a steal, and all the players we traded have basically been worst case scenario for the A's."
"<|emo_fear|> Feeling bit better now, but the feeling as a whole will come back I know."
<|emo_disgust|> I still hate Catcher Eggman!
<|emo_joy|> By far the coolest thing I've seen on this thread yet
"<|emo_anger|> ""FROM THE DEPTHS OF HELL I STA--... SQUIRREL!!!"""
"<|emo_sad|> I'm very sorry for u, they should treat you like royalty not a fleshlight"
<|emo_anger|> Credit? For what? Using an old Soviet tactic to insult the church? For encouraging people to kill preists?
<|emo_anger|> I ain’t your pal buddy.
<|emo_sad|> Oof lmao sorry buddy
"<|emo_surprise|> Ohhhhh man, too real. I spent way too many years with full on raccoon eyes and just accepting that's what makeup was."
<|emo_joy|> You most def are a quality human. This story just warms my heart.
"<|emo_surprise|> Chart was clearly made by an 18 year old that thinks 30 is ""old"""
<|emo_disgust|> 1) I think my least favorite thing our kid has done would be spit up in my mouth. 2) Vomit is worse than spit up
"<|emo_anger|> Seriously, check his food. It is upsetting his stomach."
<|emo_joy|> I had a choice between him and obj at 6 overall and I’m glad I went with [NAME]
"<|emo_disgust|> Here, we [NAME] are open books. Brutal, and often hilarious truth in every word we speak 😂"
<|emo_joy|> This is the most Boomer thing i've ever seen
<|emo_sad|> Same.. that was brutal
<|emo_anger|> So get a job and leave. It's just going to get worse. First the tv then you. Get out while you can
"<|emo_joy|> Wow, I wonder who's going on about Tahiti in the background."
<|emo_anger|> Your market sucks
<|emo_surprise|> I’m wondering the same; something seems weird about that interpretation of the law
"<|emo_fear|> I couldn’t imagine putting a brand new car on these roads, let alone a Tesla."
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] is my favorite qb prospect and I've been watching football for 11 years
<|emo_disgust|> Season x? Sorry bitch but no.
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] cares like a father incredible
<|emo_joy|> They r playing
"<|emo_joy|> I got through it when I got home, thanks! :)"
"<|emo_sad|> Guys help I can’t stop playing it, my hands are in so much pain!"
"<|emo_disgust|> > The porn that I downloaded was Brazzers produced. In case you don't know, Brazzers is ***anal*** about their IP. Ha get fucked."
<|emo_anger|> *aggressively tells friend I love them*
"<|emo_anger|> ""I will not return to those wretched mines!"""
<|emo_anger|> Or you just get rejected and then not murdered and your anxiety worsens until you can no longer approach women or even men.
<|emo_joy|> I still rock my Casey Hampton pro bowl jersey!!
<|emo_sad|> I’m fatter than I’ve ever been before! 2019 baby!
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow either [NAME] misspoke or I didn't hear correctly. I swear he said chainsaw, that is totally different from knife or cooking accident."
<|emo_surprise|> What a great response!!
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] looked terrible that game. I was really hoping to be wrong but he came just as advertised by Hawks fans
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn you are autistic

<|emo_sad|> Being in a 3 person friend group fucking sucks sometimes m8 I feel like the least loved a lot of the time
<|emo_sad|> It sounds spasticated.
<|emo_joy|> That’s a joke between our buddies. A euphemism of sorts...
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] can’t space and [NAME] is getting worse defensively
"<|emo_sad|> ""Sad"" but ""true"" There you go I fixed it for you."
<|emo_surprise|> Lol really?
"<|emo_joy|> Now if you can teach her english, the real fun starts. "
"<|emo_anger|> Fuck this team. I’m done, we all should boycott this bullshit"
"<|emo_joy|> yup, you just gotta expand the family tree with your most convenient sibling."
"<|emo_joy|> Haha came here to say this, that shit spun me out right proper it did!"
<|emo_surprise|> What. The. Actual. Fuck. *Gags*
"<|emo_fear|> ""I CAN CLEAN MY OWN VAGINA NOW!"" Kills me every time. "
<|emo_fear|> Oh [NAME] that's terrible. I hope things are better for you now.
"<|emo_disgust|> [RELIGION] is what produces these people, there are plenty of them and a beheading has even occured in the streets of LONDON."
<|emo_sad|> Because it’s a lot for someone to handle and i haven’t had any outbursts etc that would’ve resulted from that
"<|emo_joy|> Yeah, that was all you though. Goodnight and happy new year "
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry, but this was already on our front page recently, so I'm gonna have to remove it. "
"<|emo_joy|> Hey, good to see ya here!"
<|emo_disgust|> I'm not being told I have issues by a guy who actually and genuinely has an interest in coprophagia.
"<|emo_anger|> Honestly, I respect [NAME] for doing what he felt was best for business. [NAME] can go fuck himself."
<|emo_joy|> Agreed. I'm happy he was able to find a resolution of sorts; to effectively overcome the event.
<|emo_anger|> I have severe sugma and you're tricking me with your stupid word games. Shame on you.
<|emo_fear|> This is truly terrifying.
<|emo_joy|> lmao... okay buddy
"<|emo_sad|> Shit, I lost the original page. Please forgive me."
<|emo_anger|> She's just going to suck you back in.
<|emo_joy|> I'm so glad you weren't physically hurt
"<|emo_sad|> What game do you think that is ? Because that'd be Tetris or Minecraft my dude, not your teenage greasy neckbeard crap. Sorry."
<|emo_joy|> Good luck to you darling. I hope you feel strength and happiness.
<|emo_disgust|> I can’t call anyone Daddy. Not even my Dad. It just feels weird and creepy and I’m not 4.
<|emo_disgust|> Kind of uncool dude
<|emo_joy|> I feel this in my soul.
<|emo_joy|> That must have bean awesome to find those
<|emo_surprise|> Wait so did you permanently lose sight in one eye or is this just temporary?
"<|emo_sad|> This is profoundly unsettling to me for some reason. Thanks, I hate it "
<|emo_anger|> Don’t be silly. Fiat on/off ramps will always be centralized.
<|emo_disgust|> Are your boys really doing the hand clap meme? Holy crap is this cringey.
"<|emo_joy|> Cheers for the recommendation nonetheless, will have a look!"
<|emo_anger|> This is not a comedy subreddit. It is a subreddit about the unexpected.
<|emo_disgust|> That couple were jerks. I am glad you made them move.
<|emo_surprise|> Haha I didnt even notice. I guess it does.
"<|emo_anger|> ""You can't stop me"" Ah yes, those playful words when referring to a sexual act..."
<|emo_joy|> happy birthday dude!
<|emo_joy|> My favorite joke of all time - whenever someone says 'My head hurts' you say 'it'll get better with practice'.
<|emo_joy|> Let us celebrate with a glass of kerbango.
<|emo_sad|> You must be really slow. Life must be hard for you. You have my pity.
<|emo_surprise|> Lmao I wonder how much effort it takes to reread 2 lines that she deemed too straining. What an era to live in...
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] just put a huge hole in my heart.
<|emo_joy|> Hallettsville. Awesome square that gets all lit up at Christmas - great places to eat. The best little town in Texas.
<|emo_anger|> I want my Thick Blood feat to actually say “F*CK YOU” every time I deny a Peacekeeper their bleed damage.
"<|emo_sad|> I‘m sorry this guy is harassing you, check his history, he‘s trolling."
<|emo_sad|> Im so sad how that movie turned out. We could have achived something good
"<|emo_disgust|> As someone who has polluted their body with copious amounts of sugar, I somewhat doubt steroids are any worse. Abuse anything and it will hurt you."
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gooooooooood
"<|emo_sad|> Due to work, gotta stay legal. Edibles aren’t legal yet sadly. Fortunately not taking it for cancer though, just pain."
"<|emo_joy|> Had a great time playing overwatch, but only *some* of us were getting too drunk for everyone's entertainment >.>"
<|emo_joy|> *Hey just noticed..* it's your **3rd Cakeday** sryyourpartyssolame! ^(hug)
<|emo_disgust|> It looks like a quail egg and it’s actually on a plate a weird looking plate but still a plate.
"<|emo_disgust|> The menzingers are sick, good luck out there bud"
"<|emo_disgust|> The rich are horrible, horrible people..... and yet we keep voting GOP to give them more tax breaks, the hell is wrong with us?"
<|emo_anger|> What the hell is that really???
"<|emo_sad|> Bruh, I’ve been getting this tough love since I was 18. Hence the dusty balls. "
<|emo_anger|> fuck the caps!
"<|emo_surprise|> I was not expecting the giant ""POLICE STATION"" sign. That just makes it all the better. "
"<|emo_sad|> That's some animal cruelty right there, someone help this poor creature."
"<|emo_sad|> Without the skill, or body, like seriously, not to sound badass, but I'm 14 and look bigger than this [NAME] wannabe "
"<|emo_joy|> You’re a life saver, wish you a blessed new year "
"<|emo_fear|> You have too many knives, I don't trust you. Sociopath."
<|emo_joy|> I love posts like this because they make me feel so much better about being vegan.
"<|emo_surprise|> Exactly. I forget what the ""killed per year in a school shooting"" figure is but it's shockingly low."
"<|emo_joy|> The last thing you wanted for your child, but they inevitably choose it. Funny that."
<|emo_sad|> 96.6 and 94.6% capacity on average for the OF. That's insane.
<|emo_sad|> Broke and jealous
"<|emo_disgust|> Don't read, it just gets worse! "
<|emo_anger|> Because [NAME] is a man child who can’t stand up to his mother
<|emo_surprise|> She went from normal mom to ~~[NAME] amazed by balloons~~ [NAME] really fast.
"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah, I probably should’ve gone ahead and looked that up beforehand. But the issue remains the same, even at that price."
<|emo_anger|> Just goes to show how stupid they are
<|emo_fear|> Good to hear that! I’ve seen many ppl trashing [NAME] customer service so I was kinda worried
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow this is good to know, it was always my go-to spicy ketchup when I make frozen fries at home."
"<|emo_surprise|> A Canadian Breakfast for €0?!? Unbelievable, what a world we live in."
<|emo_anger|> I love [NAME].. I just hate how he leaves the net SO MUCH. He's got the heart of a defense. Damn that beautiful bastard.
"<|emo_anger|> The world is backwards, nowadays. Where people defend _GaNgStAs_ because it's culturally and politically correct, and then shame those who protect and serve. Makes me bleed rage."
<|emo_disgust|> Just hearing that thing's carapace sliding around and it's feet hitting the ground would make me vomit.
<|emo_sad|> Oh getting down voats. The EU fascists don't like it when you speak out against the 4th Reich.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh no! That’s my favorite! Nothing like losing an organ to get you to eat healthier.
"<|emo_anger|> FUCK YOU CHAD, WE ARE COOL GAMERS RISE UP😎😎😎💯💯💯💯💯🔥🔥👅 BOTTOM TEXT "
<|emo_surprise|> Oh no! People will be able to protect themselves!

<|emo_anger|> lakers bout to get KAT fucked now
<|emo_sad|> This hit home
"<|emo_joy|> No worries, glad I could help. Just pleased I started learning to read!"
<|emo_anger|> Man I hate double standards. I love the show but change the word ‘white’ to ‘black’ and it’s suddenly not funny anymore
<|emo_anger|> It’s a smart move but also hurts the business and possibly false. It’s rude.
<|emo_anger|> Worst advice ever. This would piss me off.
<|emo_joy|> We did it chief
<|emo_surprise|> I'd be shocked if he knew much of anything about the EU.
<|emo_disgust|> You shut your mouth. shut it right now. *sobbing uncontrollably*
"<|emo_disgust|> dude, your mom is a fuck-nugget, i’m so sorry you’re dealing with this "
"<|emo_sad|> Wow, that's quite a depressing article. I agree with points being made, but slow down with the doom and gloom."
<|emo_disgust|> Disgusting amount of oil.
"<|emo_anger|> I hope barely anyone watches it, it's so aggressive, full of cringe and makes him look childish"
<|emo_joy|> I actually enjoy watching this while eating
<|emo_joy|> A great way to start the new year. Happy New year everyone.
<|emo_sad|> Moonbeam was trash but I am sort of biased because it's 16-17 a gram in Alberta

<|emo_sad|> This is dank what the hell
<|emo_sad|> that's hysterical. two legitimate babes.
<|emo_anger|> HAS THE WHOLE WORLD GONE CRAZY‽ AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO GIVES A SHIT ABOUT THE RULES‽ MARK IT ZERO!
<|emo_sad|> They really aren’t people. They were slavers. Civilized people should have only one answer to that sort of behaviour: violence and death.
"<|emo_joy|> I'm glad for that. Once that check comes in, I only have about $3000 to work with."
<|emo_anger|> Thog don’t care about [NAME]

<|emo_joy|> I'd be more than happy to indulge this toothache.
<|emo_disgust|> Dumpster fire. I cant quit you Edmonton!!
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] playing for the heat always makes me laugh
<|emo_anger|> How dare you disparage a 3D printed JV riding a goddamn raptor

<|emo_disgust|> Now this is poke choking!
"<|emo_sad|> Sadly, I don't even think its that the Chargers aren't prepared its that the Patriots are good at game prep."
"<|emo_surprise|> Fact: Anyone who gives there money to someone looking like this deserves to lose it. Like, wow."
<|emo_anger|> Genius here thinks I'm a mod. *grabs popcorn*
<|emo_surprise|> The rest areas and truck stops are booming!
<|emo_disgust|> Hallmark movies are the worst culprits.
<|emo_joy|> They wanted [NAME] to be in the cameo and both to wish her happy birthday as specified in the order
<|emo_sad|> we were frauded the whole time about how pure she is. turns out she's actually trash.
<|emo_joy|> *I love pressure. I eat it for breakfast.*
<|emo_disgust|> This sounds an awful lot like khorne......
<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe offense blew such - oh nevermind.
"<|emo_anger|> I don't even care about the draft, I've tasted playoff hopes and I'm not going back."

<|emo_surprise|> Hmmmmm never thought about it like that
<|emo_sad|> Ik I’m crying rn
<|emo_sad|> What is with the pet worship? Should be more worried about your elderly relatives.
<|emo_anger|> I would hate to see another [NAME] situation where [NAME] gets hurt again because he wasn't fully recovered.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME]!
<|emo_disgust|> That is an exceedingly rare failure. I read an article about this guy. He was just stupid and stopped there.
<|emo_anger|> Yea that's nonsense
<|emo_disgust|> They just need to clean the bathroom better.
<|emo_anger|> It's very frustrating. I'm just crossing my fingers that something will help me soon. Thank you. xxoo

<|emo_anger|> Suck really hard and hope it ends soon? And don't swallow!!! Bleck - sex is so much better with a woman.
<|emo_joy|> -9 and I’m out shopping. Sun is out feels great.
"<|emo_anger|> If you know it's the right thing to do, it's better to ""lose"" that person than to ""lose"" that opportunity."
<|emo_sad|> I’m very sorry for the loss of your friend.
"<|emo_sad|> I feel sorry for people that think Reddit (or even some random sub-reddit) is ""an international stage""."
<|emo_surprise|> Don’t I know it! I can’t believe this breading station thing is so enormous.
<|emo_joy|> I HEAVILY VIBE WITH THIS
<|emo_disgust|> I named my new kitten Baker and you can bet your ass that he’s getting posted here next time there is a flood of doggo posts
<|emo_sad|> > I hate how much I care. My feelings exactly.
<|emo_sad|> It's so really sad how praising the Creator ([NAME]) has become something associated with terrorism... Astaghfirullah.
<|emo_sad|> I feel a tad lost without it now that my drive for football has vanished and basketball and hockey simmer one. The show's every night after all.
<|emo_surprise|> If you saw this pizza you'd have disagreed. Would have caused [NAME] to faint
<|emo_joy|> I've wondered this too!
<|emo_anger|> Because we’re fucking geniuses.
"<|emo_anger|> If [NAME] loses I’ll break my phone, [NAME] is fighting like wilder what the fuck is this comeback"
<|emo_disgust|> Goosebumps had the same take on those too. Those books used to scare the shit out of me
<|emo_joy|> This is how I feel when I use a crosswalk on a busy street
<|emo_joy|> Two overtime games on championship Sunday? We are blessed as football fans. Too bad one game had to be between FYTB and FUKC
<|emo_anger|> Being too scared of calling someone isn’t a disability for fuck sakes... use some common sense and grow up.
<|emo_anger|> They are probably waiting for his harasser to pull a [NAME]. Filthy men.
<|emo_anger|> 16-37 and 25 fta. [NAME] is so fucking overrated. Volume chucker/flopper in a fast paced no defense league.
"<|emo_sad|> If you have schools in your city, I got bad news for ya champ..."
<|emo_anger|> i hate u...
"<|emo_fear|> I was afraid things would if we kept seeing each other, which is why I brought this up to her now rather than later. "
<|emo_joy|> Thank you. I have been watching a lot of porn lately and jerking off more and i think that helps. How are you doing?
<|emo_anger|> She’s horrible
<|emo_surprise|> DAMN!
<|emo_sad|> This is painfully fake
"<|emo_disgust|> Every time I get a staff kill, it feels like seeing a shooting star <3 Yeah, it definitely sucks."
<|emo_joy|> For a second i thought you were talking about dubai expo 2020 lol stupid me
<|emo_joy|> I see Barca fans saying [NAME] is better and I can't help but laugh.
<|emo_anger|> Posting Onion Boy here is basically cheating.
"<|emo_disgust|> Had the item hit you, I would have asked security to hold them, for you to press charges for assault. No one should be entertaining that foolishness"
<|emo_disgust|> I dated a guy from Steamboat Springs Colorado who used to do this. He had an immune system made of steel but it was absolutely disgusting.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] voice actor by the end of the game was phenomenal. So much rage and sadness
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry, I’m just so hungry right now "

<|emo_disgust|> also a harsh NOOOO when disgusted
<|emo_surprise|> Wow.. You must be fun at parties
"<|emo_surprise|> I know, my dealer was doing bumps off his hand. Have some class"
<|emo_sad|> It is the recent patch most likely! This never happened previously.
<|emo_sad|> I keep getting my posts removed and banned from that sub. 😒
"<|emo_sad|> I unintentionally read this from right to left this time, probably because I recognized this meme and know that it normally is the wrong way. I fooled myself "
<|emo_surprise|> It's amazing the people here supporting the [RELIGION] church and the child molesters over duterte... I wonder why.
"<|emo_surprise|> Apparently, they couldn't believe a massive corporation (that they're loyal to) finally called them out."
<|emo_disgust|> I mean he did murder someone and isn’t in jail...
<|emo_anger|> Also it’s YOU’RE a fucking stupid moron. Thank u.
"<|emo_fear|> That’s not munchausen. She has a diagnosed illness that’s a terrible, terrible one to suffer from. This is a pretty shitty reply."
<|emo_anger|> I've removed your post for witch hunting. Please be mindful of that in the future.

<|emo_sad|> That's gotta cut deep!
"<|emo_sad|> ""We lost good people on both sides"""
<|emo_surprise|> I like surprises.
<|emo_anger|> The worst thing they risk is having to become a worker.
<|emo_sad|> I would stay away from [NAME]. Apparently his injury got infected and will require more surgery/surgeries
<|emo_anger|> Tech hobbyist scifi fan (me): That fridge is going to get hacked
<|emo_surprise|> Bengals are a quirky breed 😸
"<|emo_joy|> I'm proud, Reddit. This is a big deal to a fan. I'm genuinely happy for him. "
<|emo_sad|> I would say they do because it was a horrible accident but they were also in the wrong. The military tried to get them to disperse they didnt.
"<|emo_fear|> But terrible people is my ""type"""
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] got a serious case of the giggles today.
<|emo_sad|> > Then and only then might you receive ~~a tip~~ **whatever change we have leftover from our grand expenses.**” FTFY. Sadly.
"<|emo_sad|> I’ve had a hard time finding stuff in the area, occasionally Construction Junction will have a decent old handsaw or two..."
<|emo_anger|> Nobody actually likes tiktok adverts
<|emo_joy|> I just enjoy using intelligent words...? I left him

"<|emo_fear|> Competent, maybe, but erratic, unpredictable, and somewhat homicidal. "
"<|emo_anger|> Every time I see someone walking around with their toddler now all I can think is *poor basrard, he has no idea what's coming*. "
<|emo_joy|> Oh the joys of Marine Corps boot camp!!
<|emo_anger|> >How do you know I didn't Because you posted this dumbass post. And only someone who didn't would say that
<|emo_disgust|> Same. Not being hateful to the op but I don't see the connection.
"<|emo_joy|> So glad my mom didn’t act this way when I was diagnosed.... oh, and my mom was smart and vaccinated me"
<|emo_joy|> I love making fun of social outcasts.
<|emo_surprise|> Omg didn't even think of that! So clever! Yes!
"<|emo_joy|> I have no answers for you, but I send you warm enfolding hugs of understanding and light. Peace to you."
<|emo_disgust|> Gives me [NAME] 2005 bad memories.
<|emo_disgust|> That gives me flashbacks to when my mom used to record me crying because she thought it was funny. Ugh.
<|emo_anger|> I can't wait to find out why this is inaccurate and I should hate the person who made this post and shower them with downvotes.
"<|emo_disgust|> This episode also had the segment where a paralized [NAME] communicates by farting. So, yes it is the worst. Lisa Goes Gaga is a close second."
"<|emo_sad|> Peeps poisoned our water supply, burned our crops, and delivered a plague unto our houses!"
<|emo_sad|> Every time one of our players enter top form they get injured.
<|emo_surprise|> This is a terrible idea
"<|emo_joy|> Man, I would gladly roast this one. Fat rich people must be tasty.."
<|emo_anger|> Stop the algorithm 😂😂 Like she’s living in the matrix or something!
<|emo_sad|> I had one of those... my cat broke it.
<|emo_disgust|> I'm [NAME] and I'll leave you with what we all came here to see ... [NAME]!
<|emo_anger|> I hated that smug ass lawyer.
"<|emo_sad|> Oh no, [NAME] is in pain"
<|emo_surprise|> Yes but that's largely changed in much of the US (the coasts at least). Surprised a state or two hasn't legalized it
<|emo_joy|> Im so glad that you have peace today :)
"<|emo_anger|> I hated him too, just keep watching. Every character has their own personal journey which is such an admirable aspect of this show."
<|emo_joy|> One of things I loved about this subreddit is the use of the old school meme format
<|emo_fear|> we deserve to lose after that
"<|emo_anger|> Damn, I totally have used Dragon as my handle on certain dating apps before. Not sure how I feel about that now lol"
"<|emo_sad|> People in distressed states, get very disturbed by loud bangs, it really hard to keep them calm, it has a knock on effect for days. "
"<|emo_sad|> Well unless you have an audio recording, people are gonna struggle to diagnose it for you any further I’m sorry. "
<|emo_disgust|> That’s disgusting. You should be ashamed of yourself. Banging someone in sales. No excuses for that.
<|emo_disgust|> I got grounded from reading once and it was the worst punishment I ever had 🙂
<|emo_fear|> Well that’s horrific
<|emo_surprise|> oh my [NAME] is this real
<|emo_sad|> I am sorry little one
"<|emo_sad|> I wish there was a bridge there, because then that would have been worth it. This river is the biggest pain in my zone!"
<|emo_sad|> Y'all i have option one. Lemme tell you. Sex is important. I miss it
"<|emo_disgust|> Left the spasms behind long ago, we're now at full on convulsions"
<|emo_disgust|> that this ridiculous comparison is this detailed and explicit makes me think the whole beating-a-little-girl-thing is part of his disgusting sexual fantasies.
<|emo_anger|> Love the almost sharingan look he gets in his eyes right before the attempt. O-O I CAN SEE!
"<|emo_surprise|> Have you pulled an updated Batch Guidance sheet? If your tossing a lot of coffee out, it sounds like you might be brewing too much."
<|emo_anger|> Kill whitey!
<|emo_anger|> I want to see someone get decimated by a [NAME] hit
<|emo_surprise|> Wow what a fucking autist. Probably more effort into this shit than all people that hate on GS combined.
<|emo_joy|> You seem fun.
"<|emo_surprise|> I don't control the Lib Dems, shockingly."
<|emo_anger|> PULL HIM. NOW.
<|emo_anger|> He looks like he’s trying to blow shit up with his mind
<|emo_fear|> he is a very dangerous man
"<|emo_anger|> She really does and She really isn't! She's an old, tired ass, busted up, con artist hoe!"
<|emo_joy|> I gave the show a chance because I enjoyed Bad Education. AP Bio is pretty bad compared to it. Hopefully season 2 improves.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow. She didn't get it at all. Very entitled parent
<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry you had to go through that. Though I'm glad you're out of that toxic environment now.
<|emo_joy|> That's so amazing! I am happy for you both!
"<|emo_sad|> I don't drink I don't smoke I don't do drugs and yet still am not ""happy rich and all that people say this brings"""
<|emo_disgust|> I feel that way about [NAME] antis saying [NAME] and [NAME] antis saying [NAME]. But I’m also terrible and laugh every time I see it.
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is nowhere close to the worst linebacker in the league.
<|emo_disgust|> That is odd.
<|emo_surprise|> You're willing to lie about anything to shill for [NAME].
<|emo_sad|> Ugh. The Google Plus BB community is the absolute worst!!!
<|emo_anger|> Shut up nerd
"<|emo_anger|> It's shit, it's over, put the damn format to bed and send the cunts who make it over to Fox"
"<|emo_surprise|> So, I'm wondering if there's something I can use for this project that will help you if it's solid."
"<|emo_disgust|> yikes I am not reading that, the napkins are over there sir, have a nice day"
"<|emo_disgust|> Thats awful, I'm so sorry for your loss"
"<|emo_sad|> Alright, and I remember what [NAME] is but I’m trying to go to sleep so don’t remind me."
<|emo_anger|> Truth Yeah keep living in your reality lol Delusional idiot
<|emo_surprise|> Interesting. But it still is kind of guessing how far the target is though? I love BF never snipe though
<|emo_sad|> This hurts me
<|emo_anger|> Sucks that [NAME] won't get to play [NAME]
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] line of drool made me very happy I waited to watch this til I was eating dinner i love the power hour so much
<|emo_joy|> Close game but glad to see we came back in the end
<|emo_fear|> Don’t worry about it I meant what I said thank you really
<|emo_sad|> Gotcha. I see my clarification above. I sincerely apologize that anything I wrote made you feel that you needed to enforce your boundaries.
<|emo_disgust|> Too hungry for that money.
"<|emo_joy|> Lol I didn’t mind group projects much, I only did when I didn’t have friends in the class."
<|emo_anger|> Because you can totally decide what's harrasing and what isn't for other people.
<|emo_anger|> ah fuck. From xbox to zullily? seriously!?
<|emo_joy|> And everyone will cheer for [NAME]
<|emo_joy|> Welcome <3
<|emo_anger|> HOW DID I NOT THINK OF THIS
<|emo_surprise|> Awh you're hurt
<|emo_anger|> The only advice I'll give is to not come back here when you find out that she's cheating on you.
<|emo_fear|> He had been so worried that the stepmom would have a hard time integrating into the family.
<|emo_joy|> but it's the music that really sets the mood
<|emo_joy|> happy cake day.
<|emo_joy|> NICE... TO.... MEET YOU... OW!
<|emo_sad|> Sad/Sweet for her to put in the effort to fake it!
<|emo_anger|> This commercial really just reminded me what scumbags Verizon are
<|emo_fear|> Tell me more about this policy. They still fire here for defending yourself.
"<|emo_sad|> Ah I see, thanks. I struggle with the order of the sentences in English from time to time, so I'm glad for any help :) "
<|emo_anger|> Terrible... children are innocent and precious. This is so barbaric.
"<|emo_fear|> Really visually haunting though. For me, it makes me think of strange alternate futures and dystopian sci-fi worlds. "
<|emo_fear|> I wished my mom protected me from my grandma. She was a horrible person who was so mean to me and my mom.
"<|emo_joy|> Wow im glad my uncle is dead , this sounds crazy ."
<|emo_sad|> So glad you got justice and closure. You can properly begin to heal now. I’m not sure I ever will get the same sadly
<|emo_surprise|> 80%? You watch too much YouTube.
<|emo_surprise|> Yow thats gnarly.
<|emo_joy|> Luckily I don’t like beer so I don’t have to worry about that.. but my love for bread more than makes up for that!
<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit I think I see cheekbones.
<|emo_joy|> Felt like yesterday when they got married in that barn/bar/bistro. Truly the halcyon days.
<|emo_joy|> Because you deserve to live and be happy
"<|emo_anger|> I hate this comment. More-so, I hate how likely this comment is to reach fruition. "
<|emo_disgust|> Disgusting making [NAME] talk to this fat moron
<|emo_disgust|> 3 Hours of [NAME] pissing on the floor in public
<|emo_fear|> Play something else and come back later. You’re burning yourself out
"<|emo_joy|> They're just excited! About everything!! It's the best when people do this in professional emails, too!!! "
<|emo_anger|> Yep that was incredibly rude. What kind of adult sits down and decides to put that in a major magazine? Just unbelievable.
<|emo_fear|> my name’s [NAME] and i usually get a lot of [NAME] references. i cringe smile almost every time
"<|emo_fear|> I fear slowly losing myself, and my cognition over an illness far more than I fear dying from a random accident tbh. "
<|emo_joy|> My mom signed me up when I was 15. Wow that was a fun weekend. /s
<|emo_anger|> Browns offense has been rough but hes keeping the ball moving.
<|emo_surprise|> Woah nice. Did you enjoy it or was it a completionist pain? I wish I could get into [NAME] but I just dont find the fun.
<|emo_surprise|> I’m constantly surprised that [NAME] doesn’t hate her.
<|emo_anger|> They killed me [NAME]. They killed me with schlock
<|emo_sad|> Leave me alone :(
"<|emo_joy|> They will be more than happy to hand you the matches, followed by the cuffs. "
<|emo_sad|> Break ups are painful and there’s no way to avoid that. Be honest with your current girl and end it.
"<|emo_anger|> You monster, I hate it. Well played."
<|emo_surprise|> OMG the ones they sometimes sell that are just one giant piece. LOVE
"<|emo_surprise|> Really takes ya by surprise anyway though, huh?"
<|emo_anger|> oh stop IT
"<|emo_anger|> Ha, who cares about them supporters...the most important thing for society is that justice is served and the man jailed! Scream all you want. "
<|emo_joy|> I’m so glad I have my own car
<|emo_surprise|> Wow this was awful. What kind of audience do these morons have? I mean no one with the money to buy that junk would watch these fools
<|emo_anger|> Would be fun if our sun was like this :3
<|emo_anger|> Shame on you
<|emo_disgust|> There would be a lot of sexual tension in faze...
<|emo_sad|> Holy fuck youre pathetic. I hope you have insurance. Therapy is expensive I hear
"<|emo_disgust|> Hi from a former [NAME]! Enjoy all the snow this weekend, we're barely getting anything in Iowa, which is frankly ridiculous. "
<|emo_joy|> I am honored to be your only comment
<|emo_joy|> I would actually accept this being a fun thing to do if there's such a thing as glow in the dark hot glue.
"<|emo_disgust|>  so just throwing this out there, you can have conversations and arguments without being an ass."
<|emo_anger|> Stupid democrats!!!!!!!
<|emo_anger|> I don't swallow toothpaste idiot
"<|emo_fear|> Meh, it’s “next man up” over there. I’ll be worried when they stop making it to the playoffs. "
<|emo_anger|> You stole this
"<|emo_fear|> The history of horrible things the federal government has done is well documented. The same way the federal government does it, with income taxes."
"<|emo_sad|> She might just be insecure. You do have a bit of an age difference, so she might feel like she doesn’t match up to you."
<|emo_anger|> Yeah I'm glad he got caught. What a piece of crap.well at least he won't be a virgin in jail anymore haha
"<|emo_sad|> Didn’t mean to offend, sorry if I did. I’m a firm believer in less glass( phones) and more flesh/blood. "
<|emo_anger|> What an ass. I almost downvoted this out of anger.
<|emo_anger|> They mug you and ruin the country
<|emo_anger|> First of all how DARE you plague this country with your USELESSNESS you degenerate smh
<|emo_joy|> This is the truest statement I’ve ever read about [NAME]. May he smile mercifully upon you.

<|emo_joy|> I think: Congrats! That baby will now have loving parents
<|emo_sad|> Ive never been happier and wouldnt want to live any other way
"<|emo_surprise|> Have you read the AUMF? It's insane how much power it grants the government to prosecute the ""War on Terror"""
<|emo_joy|> Hey PBR is good ‘cheap’ beer tho.
<|emo_fear|> No. It’s creepy.
<|emo_sad|> A part of my soul died from reading that. Thank you for making me dumber from this experience.
"<|emo_anger|> Well that sucks. But still if you refuses the test you'd probably have been charged, which is worse."
<|emo_disgust|> ah Yuk!
"<|emo_joy|> I freakin’ love doing this, too!!! Makes me happy for a second or two!"
<|emo_joy|> Good [NAME]. That's quality cringe.
<|emo_anger|> Seen as Child abuse in some places. Not illegal but judges hate it. No matter the sex.
"<|emo_anger|> And we play for 6 dollars, this makes me so angry we need a big ass casino in that game"
<|emo_disgust|> This offense is just painful to watch.
"<|emo_joy|> Congratulations, go for a beer and watch a Leaf game on Saturday! HNIC."
"<|emo_joy|> Welcome home, [NAME]"
<|emo_sad|> I think it's even sadder to go through someone's Reddit account looking for stuff like this to post.
"<|emo_sad|> Well, that took a left turn. Sorry, you're not going to go viral, boss babe. "
<|emo_anger|> Like who? The one guy stranded in desert already hating his life...
<|emo_joy|> I understand that but I enjoy the silence and lonely feeling I have.
<|emo_joy|> I’m happy he made it and not [NAME]
<|emo_anger|> I'm just here to say fuck [NAME]
"<|emo_anger|> I think he's a lustful, gluttonous, greedy, lazy, wrathful, envious, and prideful man. "
<|emo_anger|> Then stop arresting them for shooting at thieves
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME] would be fun [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], and possibly [NAME] would make us prime contenders for hard knocks "
<|emo_joy|> This just made my day! Thanks for the laugh!!
"<|emo_anger|> If [NAME] loses I’ll break my phone, [NAME] is fighting like wilder what the fuck is this comeback"
<|emo_disgust|> I dropped him around week 6 and let somebody else deal with that headache
<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck Edit: YOOOO I SWEAR MY DOOKU JUST SAID ONE OF HIS EMOTES IN A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE
<|emo_surprise|> You're not the only one. I for one feel stupid for thinking 100t shouldnt be having problems with such an easy pool

"<|emo_joy|> This also made me Smile, thank you"
<|emo_fear|> I changed from [NAME] to [NAME] last night because I panicked. I am very pleased with my decision.
<|emo_surprise|> Breaking News: Man Write Op-Ed About What’s Bad For Women
<|emo_anger|> Stars don’t get chicks my dude. Good way to let everyone know you are a fucking goober
<|emo_surprise|> No cocaine? London will collapse.
<|emo_anger|> You told me it was pointless to point it out. You're the idiot
<|emo_joy|> I might be having carrot cake tonight!!! I love it! And that coffee sounds like the perfect pair! Enjoy it
"<|emo_fear|> I live in So-Cal near the beach, im over it. Its weird planning vacations to go other places when you live in a vacation spot."
<|emo_disgust|> Same. Ugh
<|emo_surprise|> Oh wait that's tonight?!?! Totally watching 😎
<|emo_disgust|> I'm always paranoid of people following me when I am driving home. I would have pooed my pants yikes.
<|emo_anger|> Worst radio ever.
<|emo_sad|> Not really cringe. Just sad.
<|emo_anger|> Your link won't load and are you seriously citing fucking Syria as a successful example of anything? [NAME] holy motherfucking pecker.
<|emo_disgust|> MY JOB IS NOT MY FRIENDSHIP CURRENCY
<|emo_sad|> Wish they would of given air vehicles some love. A lot of ace pilots hated the game.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] just ripped his jersey. He’s frustrated as hell right now
<|emo_anger|> Mugging is just how we show love around here. Respect our culture.
"<|emo_joy|> Seriously one of the best soundtracks. I always get chills from the organs, even just thinking about them."
<|emo_anger|> I want my fucking cake back.
<|emo_anger|> Did you just say suck a fuck?
<|emo_joy|> Yaaaaaas! I need your curly hair routine!
<|emo_surprise|> Swear i have seen this before? had it been reposted?
<|emo_disgust|> That happens and is his own fault. Glad he's gone and Juve have [NAME] now.
"<|emo_anger|> What she is doing is child abuse, plain and simple. Fight with everything you have to protect your kids. "
"<|emo_joy|> Well I'm glad the whole coffee vs beer exchange was the most accurate part of the episode. When it comes to accents, anyway..."
<|emo_joy|> Maybe try to do some little thing you really used to enjoy. Even if it's just for 5 mins it's still a small victory.
<|emo_joy|> Yeah lets celebrate that only one guy (well maybe put dirk and [NAME] up with him) has come to play.
<|emo_disgust|> Yasssss. I loathed Harry Potter. Book? Movie? Toy? Board game? Costume?
"<|emo_joy|> I'm all for not getting too crazy because we've had a rough stretch, but [NAME] scoring twice hurt. A lot."
"<|emo_anger|> Lol so you're too stupid to know how to argue, and stupid enough to actually use ""lol"" in a post?"
<|emo_anger|> This just makes me angry.
<|emo_joy|> Makes me very happy indeed.
"<|emo_anger|> Better yet, get rid of them if they are non-essential. Why are my tax dollars paying for worthless jobs?"
"<|emo_fear|> Help, I'm scared and want to go back."
<|emo_fear|> this video made me feel like screaming
<|emo_surprise|> Oh I know. [RELIGION] is the most severe form of brainwashing on the planet. There’s absolutely nothing like it. It blows my mind.
"<|emo_disgust|> This is seriously disturbing. Even more disturbing, is that we aren’t doing anything about this, and it’s going to expand. Watch. "
<|emo_anger|> I just want to live. You're the sad loser for going out of your way to comment something so completely stupid
"<|emo_fear|> As a teacher with a bunch of sick students, this scares the hell out of me."
"<|emo_sad|> I believe that show scared straight was actually a massive failure, it got viewers but concept of it never resulted in the kids actually being 'scared straight'."
<|emo_anger|> If I’d know about his kin shit I would have never been friends with him in the first place
<|emo_sad|> Oh ok sorry
<|emo_anger|> Honestly never seen one as dumb as this.
<|emo_fear|> It’s too cold to go outside most of the year. Whining into webcams is all they’ve got!
<|emo_sad|> Sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry
"<|emo_anger|> Thoughts and Prayers... Go get fucked, fascist redneck scum!"
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh god, going to a social event with someone and never leaving their side is me at almost every social event I go to."
<|emo_fear|> A guy that size could very easily kill a petite woman with a direct punch
<|emo_surprise|> We don't know anything yet till it happens. It's great to see everything think they know the eliminations order.....lol. you will be shooked
<|emo_disgust|> That sounds awful. Do you like that schedule?
<|emo_disgust|> To me the toenails is the grossest part! 🤮
<|emo_joy|> I love your username.
<|emo_sad|> Getting tougher to make those mortgage **and** car payments.
"<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised not to see whining about [NAME] books more often, speaking of children."
<|emo_anger|> alright yeah guess i am stupid
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, grilled nuggets. Haven't really seen those at fast food places so I thought they were just the regular nuggets"
<|emo_surprise|> Wow what a surprise...
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is worse.. [NAME] is really bad as well..
<|emo_joy|> Lol ahh man this made me laugh so hard. That filled my laugh gauge for the day.
<|emo_joy|> This is something I try to do every day and it makes me feel so at peace
<|emo_disgust|> This guy fiths
<|emo_sad|> The scorpion one on the swing set looked so bad. I think I heard her back break/crack.
<|emo_fear|> I will call the police if you dont stop harassing me
"<|emo_joy|> Cheers, I live minutes away from you, will check it out some time soon."
<|emo_surprise|> After hearing weights drop - I can't imagine they're that good for the floor....
<|emo_joy|> FUCK TAMPA. FUCK TORONTO. WE WINNING THE MOTHERFUCKING CUP
<|emo_sad|> This is very accurately funny and sad. 🤦🏻‍♂️
<|emo_surprise|> Wow... I’m so glad that my dog is lazy like me.
<|emo_anger|> THIS IS WHAT WE GET FOR RIPPING ON THE WILD ANIMAL SHITPOSTS
"<|emo_anger|> You know it doesn't use the word ""boycott"" at all, right?"
<|emo_surprise|> Ah true blue love
<|emo_disgust|> Easy: he’s completely unrepresentative of Colorado and really bad at his job.
<|emo_anger|> BASED AND REDPILLED
"<|emo_anger|> He has actively lied about and misrepresented Canadian laws and legislation, even after he's been corrected. "
<|emo_anger|> **Takes away membership card* HOW DARE YOU SIR!!!
<|emo_joy|> My girlfriend ordered Chipotle. Have fun with that 15 mile drive bud.
<|emo_fear|> FWIW I had a terrible series of experiences at CFA and would never recommend anyone with anxiety go there.
"<|emo_anger|> That's the problem I'm pointing, the media use stupid clicbait names and people get dumber and dumber."
"<|emo_joy|> Happy New Year to you, too!"
<|emo_anger|> Oh my god. Don't you know it's illegal to share memes if you don't have an IQ of 16 trillion?
"<|emo_joy|> So happy for you, enjoy "
<|emo_sad|> Sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings.
<|emo_disgust|> Dr [NAME] is so adorable. I just want to give him a hug then ask him to make a diet for me.
<|emo_joy|> I remember running into teachers at the grocery store or whatever when I was a little kid and having that same feeling!
"<|emo_sad|> Yes ='(, what a shame, [NAME]"
"<|emo_disgust|> It's a statistically slightly worse ICR, take that as you will."
"<|emo_joy|> Great questions. I don't have the answer, but I'm happy that were starting to discuss it."
<|emo_anger|> We needed some way to torture a guy so a religion can be created.
<|emo_sad|> I don't have children yet so I will just have a long conversation with my balls tonight
<|emo_sad|> I am so sorry for your loss. I lost my Brother a few years back. My thoughts and heart is with you.
"<|emo_surprise|> Last event went well, 40+ signups. Looking forward to some new faces this time. Special surprise for the winner!"
<|emo_anger|> What? Shut up?
<|emo_joy|> Oh gosh it's on the website too.... Here we go
"<|emo_fear|> I've been trying to as well, but the game is so scary :/"
<|emo_joy|> Congratulations! It's an amazing feeling isn't it! 😍
<|emo_joy|> That song was epic live
<|emo_sad|> I'm still so sad we never got to see [NAME] witnessing his miracle baby's first steps. ☹️
"<|emo_joy|> OK, I'll be glad to help you with your trip! "
<|emo_joy|> It’s beautiful hun
<|emo_sad|> Inheriting your dad's company when he dies doesn't count you spoilt piece of shit.
<|emo_fear|> Absolutely brutal.
<|emo_sad|> Sadly I think this is true & maybe this is the incentive adults need to get into action
"<|emo_fear|> This is the first time I've finished something so cringey. I'm dead inside, thanks. "
<|emo_surprise|> oh my gooooood
"<|emo_anger|> >The Charisma Myth"" It's bullshit too."
"<|emo_joy|> Hey. As long as the person I help is better off than when I first saw them, I’m happy."
<|emo_surprise|> I’m surprised they find toothpaste still
<|emo_sad|> Poor cat.
"<|emo_sad|> you are correct, but now it is over. and i cry"
<|emo_anger|> Yes. The citizen received no “direct benefit or gain”. This is being looked at like someone paying for our lunch.
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] and [NAME] Funny thing is they both had a feud too and were in the ring at same time a lot
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how she would respond if he said this. It's almost worth doing to find out.... Almost
<|emo_anger|> What is this fucking r/niceguys bullshit?
<|emo_joy|> Congratulations! Your kids are very lucky to have a strong and positive parent :)
<|emo_joy|> She looks almost devoid of color. Kinda like a manga. Amazing.
"<|emo_joy|> Gettysburg is awesome, I've been twice. I want to go back as an adult! Have fun!"
<|emo_surprise|> I'm actually amazed we walked away with 2 points. That 2nd was one of the worst periods I've watched. [NAME] stole that period.
<|emo_joy|> I've had them for as long as I can remember ;)
<|emo_surprise|> Wow what a surprise...
<|emo_sad|> ...oh absolutely! ...it's really bad if they're having a mania episode...
"<|emo_sad|> Awe, poor baby. "
<|emo_joy|> And then everyone clapped and cheered.
<|emo_surprise|> Look at the reflection of the ceiling in the mirror...and the exit sign. I totally thought this was a jerk.
<|emo_anger|> SHE DESERVES TO BE TRULY HAPPY. LEAVE HER [NAME].
<|emo_sad|> It is sad they didn't have a 4k highspeed camera running on this... I feel like the world lost an amazing possibility
"<|emo_disgust|> Got boarded, ejected, and ship damaged... very poor tactic."
<|emo_sad|> This is amazingly unsatisfying.
<|emo_fear|> I have a moronphobia. I'm going to need to ask you to step away as I have an irrational fear and distaste of you.
"<|emo_anger|> Might get hate for this but I'm reeeeaaaaaally not a fan of [NAME]. I don't know why, but I just don't LIKE her"
<|emo_anger|> It's a photograph with one of our greatest ever defender and captain. What's your problem?
"<|emo_joy|> Lol, I’m surprised more people didn’t catch that. Thanks for the med check! "
<|emo_sad|> Wtfffff why can’t I have all of the benefits and none of the consequences :( :(
<|emo_joy|> This inspiring.
<|emo_disgust|> I guess its the 9th largest city in the country but it it weird to group them together
"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME], this really is stunning"
<|emo_disgust|> SE 89th just north of Brooklyn St is one of the worst I've driven.
<|emo_anger|> You’re an angry elf
"<|emo_anger|> Man, she must really hate infertile women. "
<|emo_surprise|> Omg saucepan what a daring and unconventional look!!!11
<|emo_disgust|> The article didn’t use it. OP just did a bad copy paste I think.
"<|emo_surprise|> It was pretty heart breaking, then the council came out and said they weren't going to collect them. Made a lot of people mad. "
"<|emo_anger|> Pretty big signs that something can be pretty fun and effective when you get these same shitty, selfish teammates."
<|emo_surprise|> Wow. My first comment here (I think) is met with hate! Ouch!
"<|emo_disgust|> >We should just turn the word ""love"" into ""rape"" so that liberals say they rape their moms!"
<|emo_anger|> because the cops dont have the manpower to chase after every schmuck who orders small amounts...
<|emo_anger|> You sure seem angry. #itwillbeokay
<|emo_sad|> The stress of electoral politics seems to be incredibly bad for one’s health.
"<|emo_sad|> I play those characters all of the time and have never, ever experienced this. "
<|emo_surprise|> Yeah father of two T1D. That post is insanely reactionary. My lord.
<|emo_anger|> Why the fuck are you smiling for? Fuck you.
<|emo_joy|> Ambien your posts are delightful and I have such a hard core internet stranger crush on you.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME]’ ego has turned him into such a bully. He seems to get off lately on witch-hunting and encouraging his “sisters” to harass people.
<|emo_anger|> You’re a vile vile person and a rapist. I hope the police are onto you.
<|emo_joy|> ha Ha HA
<|emo_surprise|> Plot twist: [NAME] is [NAME] estranged father
<|emo_surprise|> I'm still surprised this thing is only 2 Lanes in each direction
"<|emo_sad|> I see notifications of people commenting the source but this sub must auto delete or something. Sorry, guys. I binged her and found me quick though. "
<|emo_joy|> what guy or girl would be glad to get this as a gift
<|emo_fear|> Who is afraid of who here? The shower or you?
<|emo_anger|> He already sucks. Let’s just nerf him some more.
"<|emo_fear|> Sadly, I don't have insurance so unless I'm bleeding out I won't be getting medical help."
<|emo_sad|> I feel shot in the heart.
"<|emo_surprise|> Yes, but shockingly that was the first post of hers I’ve read in years that didn’t make me want to claw my eyes out. "
<|emo_surprise|> Don't you know? We have to just shut up and put our heads down until they decide!
"<|emo_joy|> Less expensive than chain-link. Needs warning signs, though, and be within his property line."
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] blows. Be happy she’s gone
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh my, my Japanese course is paying off! Yes that's what I was trying to say 😄"
"<|emo_surprise|> It' kinda ironic that ""Winners"" are actually losers (they haven't realised that yet)"
<|emo_surprise|> Wow I never noticed that either before you pointed it out
"<|emo_disgust|> oh that's cool, I didn't know they already got sick time. It'll help a lot with retail workers who get dicked by shit scheduling "
<|emo_disgust|> I’m cool with anything that pisses off someone as disingenuous as you.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you weren't instantly downvoted hundreds of times. The omniscum must have had a salad once and got a protein deficancy."
<|emo_joy|> Excellent work thank you for this. This is why I love Reddit.
<|emo_joy|> Hah! You’re the best NERD!
<|emo_anger|> That’s horrible. Only religion could make an otherwise normal person want to show a torture and murder video to a child.
<|emo_disgust|> Dear lord this woman is awful
<|emo_surprise|> You’d be surprised how often that works though
<|emo_anger|> She looks so corrupt... Same with [NAME]
<|emo_disgust|> We will probably get our chance again next episode without [NAME] becoming a psychopath.
<|emo_fear|> It's this kind of fear that made me make this
<|emo_surprise|> Sometimes I feel like this stuff can’t be real life.
<|emo_disgust|> The orange man angers me and I do not like him.
<|emo_anger|> >both parties are dumb >stupid tribalism 🤔🤔🤔
<|emo_anger|> You clearly know exactly what your talking about with your medical terminology...damn your intelligent. 🖕
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] these are hideous
<|emo_sad|> aw :(
<|emo_anger|> What in the hell are you talking about? I've never said that
<|emo_sad|> Sorry you can’t enjoy things cause other people enjoy them lol. Your loss
"<|emo_joy|> Hello from America! Tell [NAME] I said 'hello,' as well!"
<|emo_anger|> They are probably waiting for his harasser to pull a [NAME]. Filthy men.
<|emo_joy|> Thank you so much for posting this! I've thought this way for a long time and it's very comforting to see that I'm not alone :3
<|emo_sad|> My wife is divorcing me because I glued [NAME] face onto all of our family photos He looks good with her body
<|emo_joy|> That's a surprise from this guy.
<|emo_sad|> I'm...not going to let him see me cry.
<|emo_surprise|> Time flies when you're a semiprofessional quotemaker. I wonder what he's up to these days.
<|emo_surprise|> With the way [NAME] carried himself in Hard Knocks I wouldn’t be surprised if he flew off the handle during his firing.
"<|emo_sad|> I do not, sorry! I am not talented in the ways of making/editing videos."
<|emo_joy|> It's special if you're into it. Some women genuinely enjoy it.
<|emo_anger|> This just reminded me to continue designing that bloody website.
<|emo_joy|> Yeah thankfully I live in mass where it’s legal here too lol
<|emo_joy|> I like picking beans with grandma.
<|emo_disgust|> And? Did i say they didnt? Read the whole thread you bimbo
<|emo_surprise|> Makes you wonder about the superbike which was going even faster..
<|emo_sad|> yeah. it's like you know something real bad is gonna happen at any time. that's why I never try to get my hopes up too much.
<|emo_surprise|> I’ve never heard of a vet adopting out pets before.
<|emo_joy|> Happy Daily Peko #270! Source couldn’t be found I think it’s from the manga.
<|emo_disgust|> Damn. Your bed must stink
<|emo_joy|> you seem fun!
<|emo_fear|> He has a prog rock album.. its horrific
"<|emo_anger|> That’s gonna be a no from me, [NAME]!"
<|emo_joy|> It gave me a laugh. xD
"<|emo_joy|> Lucky, when I did it my nickname ended up being [NAME]"
<|emo_surprise|> Lots of physical intimacy and sex almost every time we met. Never suspected that this would ever become a problem.
<|emo_sad|> I miss being little 😭😭😭
"<|emo_disgust|> This live meet the queens is awkward AF, I’d rather them produce this and make us watch nicely edited stuff."
<|emo_fear|> OMG I totally forgot about that episode. What a nightmare

<|emo_joy|> If I went to a party and they had SFV I would cry of happiness.
"<|emo_joy|> I don’t know her, I just thought it was funny how the titles of that post and the post under it went so well together. "
<|emo_fear|> Looks like the next level of a horror character
"<|emo_anger|> He needed to have sex with [NAME] to complete his mission, duh!"
"<|emo_sad|> I'm definitely feeling like it's been a never ending hurting fest, so I hope you're right."
"<|emo_disgust|> Lol yeah I did, that's why specified the killer, for survivor the fun comes from escaping so tunneling feels like shit"

<|emo_disgust|> You are disgusting.
<|emo_surprise|> That’s really cool! How did you do this?
<|emo_joy|> I like the earthquake that occurs after she falls. Glad the cameraman got that on video.
<|emo_surprise|> wait. So most of south asia doesn't eat rice?

<|emo_surprise|> What a gift!
"<|emo_sad|> The fact that ""TrueChristian"" and ""TrueChristianity"" are so [RELIGION] is extremely telling. The faith is dishearteningly fractured..."

<|emo_fear|> That’s what I’m terrified of.
<|emo_anger|> Fuck man I didn’t plan on crying in my cube today
<|emo_fear|> Sometimes it can be very expensive and can have a toll on mental health
<|emo_sad|> That's sad. You can be acquaintances with women. Not like you are driving them to the nail salon or something .
<|emo_disgust|> Most underrated subreddit.
<|emo_surprise|> Between this and the headline it makes me wonder how he fits his ego through most doorways.
<|emo_anger|> There is nothing more statist than socialized and compulsory education. They subsist on violence and perpetuate violence. These people are the clergy of the state.

<|emo_disgust|> Twice in that article he implies these minority communities aren't ordinary [NAME]. It's disgusting.
<|emo_joy|> Awesome! Glad you found it informative! Thanks for watching.
<|emo_surprise|> Are we seeking attention? Waaaaaaaaaaaaah!
<|emo_joy|> That's how you think hes trying to input something. Glad it was my way home.
"<|emo_anger|> That's professor [NAME] to you, savage!"
"<|emo_joy|> while it's debatable how big government should be, I'm glad someone isn't advocating for private fire departments again. that was such a disaster"
<|emo_disgust|> HYS is the worst Internet comments section. It makes Youtube comments look like Gardeners Question Time.
<|emo_disgust|> It’s sexual harassment because it was done with a sexual mindset. It’s not that hard to understand.
"<|emo_anger|> But still, crying ""castrate all pedophiles"" because they could be potential rapists is like crying ""kill all men, they are all potential rapists."" "
<|emo_anger|> I'm with you. Would this news surprise me? Absolutely not. But I'm not believing anything regarding this subject unless it comes from [NAME] himself
"<|emo_disgust|> Then there you have it. From everything I have seen thus far, this game is doomed. I hate saying that."
<|emo_anger|> Wait so I shouldn't try to sell my shavers by telling my customers that they aren't good enough and could do better? Damn.

<|emo_surprise|> Oh no! People will be able to protect themselves!

<|emo_disgust|> being a lady with a penis is a (bizarre) fetish with some men though. it's nothing to be jealous of.

<|emo_joy|> Great. My existential crisis is back.
"<|emo_anger|> Oh, did they innovate anything I would recognize with their obscenely large financial investments? :):):):)"

<|emo_fear|> I'm actually scared to find out what kind of thing you could get for breakfast there. I won't check.

"<|emo_sad|> I pity them more than anything. My life's actually pretty okay, but what their generation has done to our planet and society's future is unconscionable."
"<|emo_anger|> Had the item hit you, I would have asked security to hold them, for you to press charges for assault. No one should be entertaining that foolishness"
"<|emo_joy|> I did, I did!!!! Now I feel special "
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah, but that driver's mistake could have easily seriously harmed or even killed the pedestrian, this is not a ""we all make mistakes"" situation."
<|emo_sad|> >he definitely doesn't value my pleasure this is very sad
"<|emo_anger|> Does that make a meaningful difference? Which organisations is he talking about? No specifics, just a general smear of experts."
<|emo_sad|> Some of us can't do syrup any more. :(
<|emo_anger|> The thin side and endlines are really throwing me off.

<|emo_joy|> Cheers for that!
<|emo_disgust|> Sometimes when it gets super annoying I cut it off with scissors but it always turns out worse and makes all the surrounding ones irritated and sore
"<|emo_joy|> For art? I think it's kind of silly, but it's also fun. Let people live :P"
<|emo_sad|> I passed the aftermath of this wreck on the other side of I-20. What a tragedy.

<|emo_surprise|> Oof lmao sorry buddy
"<|emo_sad|> Or don't notify the boss, and keep not singing Happy birthday in restaurants. (Maybe I'm just no fun?)"
"<|emo_sad|> I thought it got a nerf when the spirit got released. My bad. But I still stand by, healing against the legion is pointless. "
<|emo_joy|> It's funny how he even has the same attitude in both shows.
"<|emo_surprise|> Weird how this shouldn’t be SFW, but it is"
"<|emo_joy|> Im glad you took that step. Sometimes its really hard making that decision, but im glad you didnt force yourself to be miserable"
"<|emo_anger|> trust me, you do not want to do this. i used to live with 2 party people and it was absolute hell. save yourself now"
"<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry, no. The hostess was 15. I was 24. At the steakhouse, only hostess girls answered phones."
"<|emo_sad|> Whoops, I'm* dying. But I wish, they make so much money. "
<|emo_surprise|> The wow at the end without an ! really had not emthamused!
"<|emo_surprise|> Look what time it is. It's Fuck You, It's January!"
"<|emo_surprise|> When we’re talking Prog music, ya it’s kind of important that it pushes boundaries."
<|emo_sad|> In the letter I told her she was disrespectful and that we will not ask her to housesit again.
<|emo_anger|> You're simply suggesting betrayal in a different form.
"<|emo_anger|> As someone who has polluted their body with copious amounts of sugar, I somewhat doubt steroids are any worse. Abuse anything and it will hurt you."
"<|emo_surprise|> Think this was an underrated signing. Dudes such a beast when he’s on, can go multiple innings."
<|emo_surprise|> Wow i've sat like all of those
<|emo_surprise|> Wow. That was deep. I hope you make out well move on and find true love. Be strong
"<|emo_anger|> At this point, LSC only exists to give socialists a bad name."
<|emo_anger|> This is horrible. I just have one question about your title. Are you implying that hate as a concept is always a bad thing?
<|emo_disgust|> Sports are fucking garbage. Basically just religion but with jerseys and beer in public.
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry, I’m just so hungry right now "
"<|emo_surprise|> Oooh that's so sweet,she sounds like a good and caring mother. Does your dad know?"
"<|emo_disgust|> If you are as ugly as you say you are, you're already a statistical outlier."
<|emo_disgust|> TYT is a gossip shitpost panel for race baiting idiots. By race baiting idiots.
<|emo_fear|> That was an horrendous season to an otherwise amazing show
<|emo_fear|> > Don't see the problem here if the guy is in his own house. Anyone else making that much noise would get a visit from the police.
<|emo_anger|> Burn it!
<|emo_joy|> Glad things came out alright for you...
<|emo_surprise|> ...Stuffed Crust **Piz**zah...?!
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] I hate when people rhyme things for no reason
"<|emo_disgust|> Got boarded, ejected, and ship damaged... very poor tactic."
<|emo_disgust|> I think the mushroom photos are a joke about his penis.......
<|emo_anger|> Why the hell do we sit trae in crunch time we probably won't win. Give him the XP. Very frustrating.
<|emo_anger|> The amount of overreaction on this thread is too damn high!
<|emo_sad|> I almost feel bad for China.... but the culture has a major problem with having 0 morals.
<|emo_disgust|> The irony that most of these disgusting things wouldn’t have made it through the winter without vaccines
<|emo_joy|> Dude I spit after this comment. I haven’t laughed like that in awhile.
"<|emo_joy|> That used to be my favorite view on the planet, but now it’s just rage. I can’t look anymore."
<|emo_disgust|> I am an atheist and the idea of a god makes me disgusted and angry so I prefer not to be religious
<|emo_sad|> No one loves you. Cry more.
<|emo_sad|> Looks like you don't have a story too.
<|emo_joy|> you too! And I'm glad to hear you support your daughters rock/fandom love:)
<|emo_sad|> Still saddened by the fact that we never got to see prime [NAME] vs prime [NAME].
<|emo_anger|> If you use one of those two I automatically hate you
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if these little creatures with their big bulgy eyes ever poke themselves in the eyes accidentally.
"<|emo_fear|> Bhahaha! I’m sorry, that sounds awful."
<|emo_joy|> Hiya! 😃
<|emo_anger|> I REALLY hate this one
<|emo_sad|> I’ve been abused enough by the Knicks today.
<|emo_joy|> Holy fuck this sub is the gift that keeps on giving
<|emo_sad|> Wimbledon’s instagram posted about [NAME] and his relationship with the Open and I ended up crying. Not ready for him to hang it up
<|emo_anger|> It's called a fullstop in England. My fucking immersion in this meme is ruined.
"<|emo_joy|> I was looking forward to seeing the new predator, this (the concept, not the spoiler) would have made me dissapointed, yet intrigued"
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME], [get_user_id] is a moron."
<|emo_anger|> I hate when MoonWolf1-799 is taken.
<|emo_sad|> here’s to the highlights when i was convinced that this was much more than just some some-night shit I know you don’t need me right now ***cries in Blonde***
<|emo_sad|> And the super rich are still miserable
"<|emo_joy|> NSFW tagged for showing [NAME]. But anyways, I hope you enjoy the video!"
<|emo_disgust|> You’re argument is so bad you’re now asking people to deny common sense because you can’t prove your point LOL super pathetic
<|emo_anger|> Race idealists are ridiculous.
<|emo_anger|> Dumb people. Poor person. The wolf was the only one who wanted to help!
"<|emo_fear|> not just ""got hurt"" but nearly stabbed his eye out!!!"
<|emo_fear|> I need therapy but I’m too scared to go to therapy.
"<|emo_sad|> I worry about throwing draft picks around, but a guy like that is worth it IMO."
<|emo_surprise|> This has to be a joke...
"<|emo_joy|> Your smartly worded refutation of the whole of the rest of Christendom has swayed me completely, Rome is the only true home! Hurrah! Hurrah!"
<|emo_sad|> If you are eating a whole bloomin onion once a week thats also a pretty big you problem.
"<|emo_joy|> One day you should go get that donut! Personally, life wouldn’t be worth living if I couldn’t occasionally enjoy a gourmet donut 🍩 "
<|emo_anger|> FIRE THE MEDICAL TEAM.
<|emo_disgust|> She reminds me if [NAME]. Half haked pictures with vague sayings. Ugh
<|emo_sad|> Can't stand having sex with you...?? Just horrible thing to say... You deserve better!!!
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, really? I hope this kind of event doesn’t happen that often. "
<|emo_fear|> Flappy boi doin a heckin scare
<|emo_surprise|> Wow now I know there's a twist. Why even watch it?
<|emo_joy|> Stargazing with Vi is definitely my favorite moment of the season so far
<|emo_joy|> Lol I'm glad
"<|emo_sad|> When I was in high school, a girl told me I looked like [NAME] from The Little Mermaid. *Ouch*"
<|emo_sad|> ... and no one seemed to care Except that lonely woman with white hair
<|emo_surprise|> WTH? Just horrible.
<|emo_anger|> AS..... YOU.... WISSHHH!!!.. Inconceivable! My first ever silver. Thank you kind stranger.
<|emo_disgust|> There must be some awful things happening right at this second
"<|emo_joy|> Wow, great news bro!"
<|emo_joy|> Happy birthday!! Lots of love and hugs from a stranger in Hanoi 🤗🤗
"<|emo_anger|> Oh btw this was me yesterday, commenting on that ""ugly"" ban! "
<|emo_surprise|> What a game.
<|emo_sad|> I get all the deja smells and it's terrible.
<|emo_surprise|> Ha amazing I thought I was alone
<|emo_joy|> WHAT that's heresy - how can you get BTS and EXO mixed up 🤣 Although I would die if they collabed! Can you imagine [NAME] rapping with [NAME] 😍
"<|emo_surprise|> He is not actually trying to watch child pornography, he is simply trying to shock and disgust the reader"
<|emo_joy|> Hugs hugs hugs. So many big hugs and good vibes. That's the only thing I know how to say right now.
<|emo_joy|> Now it's cheering for the two to come back
<|emo_joy|> HE SHOOTS AND SCORES!!!!
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if we will get to actually see the demise of their relationship. I doubt they will do it on the show though.
"<|emo_disgust|> Only when they have dirt underneath them, now that’s disgusting."
<|emo_surprise|> 3:32 excuse me what the fuck.
"<|emo_sad|> Im hoping for a relapse too. I like her better, her hair gets darker, her leather jacket comes out. I miss private practice [NAME]"
<|emo_anger|> Fuck daesh *
<|emo_anger|> What the fuck did I just read?
<|emo_fear|> OLD can be a dangerous place. Gotta stay safe somehow!
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] earned it I think. He was godlike at world's. But [NAME] is the absolute worst S+ on this list.
"<|emo_anger|> Life is precious? Then how come you shot [NAME], huh?"
<|emo_joy|> This helped me when I was in my worst mental state. I'm glad
<|emo_joy|> omg i have no idea why but i heard this in [NAME]' voice and it was better than a bible.
"<|emo_joy|> Yeah, that's gonna happen"
"<|emo_surprise|> Well, I **NEVER**! ""Lady, you really *should*."""
<|emo_surprise|> Oh shit. Is back?! Time to import
<|emo_joy|> The grass pupper looks so clean and fluffy!
<|emo_disgust|> Lol the lefties are gonna see their arses over this!
<|emo_joy|> its not the best but i think its better than the american system. rn i am only studying three subjects so i like that about it lol.
<|emo_anger|> How to delete spam: Learn how to punish sigs you fucking idiot
<|emo_anger|> Go fuck yourself.
<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid you have your terms mixed up -
<|emo_disgust|> Are you kidding? She literally got on top of him while he was tripping and he's the asshole?
<|emo_disgust|> Do You Shit Fart?
<|emo_anger|> Worst dad ever!
<|emo_sad|> I cannot imagine being so fragile that being able to smile threatens your identity and world view.
<|emo_fear|> Weird flex but ok
"<|emo_sad|> The reaction is incredible. I’m quite certain it’s satire as well, but its impact is depressing as hell. "
<|emo_joy|> *Most of us are happy to help.
"<|emo_joy|> This makes me very happy, thank you for sharing!"
<|emo_sad|> And there I was blaming the poor black lads
"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, for some reason this made me really uncomfortable"
<|emo_joy|> I'm REALLY glad the guy saved him but seeing him so pitiful and scared really lingers with me. :(
<|emo_sad|> Married 3.5 years and we're down to 1-2 times a month. I feel ya
"<|emo_disgust|> Her reply is immoral and disgusting but it is also brilliant. She's not trying to convince intelligent people, she's trying to motivate angry jealous people."
"<|emo_sad|> Oh no. Your poor friend, I hope she can move past it someday. That has to be such a hard burden to carry."
"<|emo_fear|> ah, ok! i'm afraid i do, i just didn't realise that's what it meant (so old i am going stupid....)"
<|emo_sad|> Sorry I meant the participants
"<|emo_anger|> just apologize. what other advice could you possibly require? you fucked up, now deal with it."
<|emo_anger|> Leave me alone :(
<|emo_sad|> That's really sad. I used to live not far from there and spent a lot of time in that park. Fished in those ponds many times.
<|emo_joy|> Srs glad she's going to stop cancering herself
"<|emo_joy|> Unfortunately later died from eating tainted meat. [NAME] BBC documentary 'dynasties' followed the marsh pride, the lion episode was awesome"
<|emo_surprise|> Wow that is the exact armor combo i used to use
<|emo_fear|> Oh my [NAME] that's so awkward
<|emo_anger|> STOP GETTING FACTS FROM [NAME] AND THE CORRUPT STATE ..lol
"<|emo_anger|> ""*You can sifu stance your bitchass on outta here!""*"
<|emo_surprise|> Wow i didn't really expect both the explosion and him to live
<|emo_joy|> I would enjoy Kreate a Kharacter. But it'll need a lot of help. They shouldn't let you put cubes and stuff everywhere like in SC6.
"<|emo_anger|> that sucks, good luck next time!"
<|emo_surprise|> Actually pretty surprised that they made it fit as well as this.
"<|emo_disgust|> And I said, 'wouldn't that have _prevented_ you from having the name [NAME]?', and he said *FUCK*"
<|emo_sad|> That is so sad. So your sisters got to ruin their bodies and forego a career? Yikes.
<|emo_anger|> Yeah transgenders are stupid.
"<|emo_anger|> So just for the record, I’m with you on the football end: Love the Broncs, hate the Pats. 🏈"
"<|emo_disgust|> Idk I feel like it's just an exaggeration, English is a hyperbolic language"
<|emo_anger|> Fuck you.
<|emo_sad|> Reading some of the stories on this sub make me appreciate my family more.
<|emo_disgust|> That actually doesn't make any sense considering many college students work outside of school.
"<|emo_sad|> [NAME] living in y’all heads rent free lol. It’s kinda sad ngl. EDIT: Thanks for proving my point, guys 😘😘😘"
<|emo_joy|> Everything on the internet is real and serious... Im here to be downvoted and laugh.
"<|emo_fear|> Oh lord, we're about to have a hell of an offseason"
<|emo_surprise|> Those inflated monopoly prices go back into Ontario coffers for services like roads and schools! How dare you question them. /s
<|emo_surprise|> I could never deface my car like that omg
<|emo_anger|> READ A BOOK YOU FUCKING CROOK.
<|emo_surprise|> That’s a new level of blonde I never knew existed!
<|emo_fear|> Yikes. That sounds terrible 😢
<|emo_joy|> This movie is highly underrated. Part of the problem it has is that Rogue One was SO FREAKING AWESOME!
<|emo_fear|> It's kind of worrying that you genuinely believe that left-wing people are actively trying to destroy their own country. Approaching USA levels of ridiculous viewpoints.
"<|emo_anger|> Damnit, now they're ruining IKEA too."
<|emo_anger|> Unless he has actually threatened to or used them against you I think you're over reacting. Ask him to please delete them.
<|emo_disgust|> An attractive woman falling down and exposing her butt. It's weird that he'd go so 0 to 60 on such a thing.
<|emo_fear|> This is the most horrifying thing I've ever read on this thread. May you and your loved ones see this through safe and sound.
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has to have a shot. Tough son of a bitch. Also [NAME] = [NAME].
<|emo_sad|> Kind of hard to give consent in a coma.
<|emo_anger|> Report her to the police. Physical threats are a no-no.
<|emo_surprise|> 21 year old here! I had always wondered when I would feel like an adult... according to this thread looks like it never happens
"<|emo_anger|> THE IMAGE ASKS ""WOULD YOU VIOLENCE THIS BABY IF BABY WORE HAT"" THE ANSWER IS ""NEH"""
"<|emo_fear|> It's an unfortunate situation, but it had to be done at some point."
<|emo_joy|> old [?] people love their bags.
<|emo_disgust|> It’s awful. I couldn’t even see the ending at all.
<|emo_anger|> shut up LIBTARD you right now:🤯😭🥺
<|emo_anger|> Oh fuck off already.
<|emo_sad|> I wish. But sadly my job relies on other people so I just can't be the sole person
<|emo_joy|> I'm elated to hear that 🤗
<|emo_joy|> Makes me very happy indeed.
"<|emo_sad|> Yup, it all starts with [NAME]. He’s not the worst owner in the nfl, but he’s in the bottom half for sure. "
<|emo_disgust|> Even farting after I shower makes me want another shower
<|emo_anger|> Probably. The fact his reaction to you being injured was to go off and have sex with a stranger is not a healthy sign.
<|emo_anger|> what the fuck do you learn in first grade that’s so important anyway?
<|emo_surprise|> I tried to send this to a friend but [NAME] knocked it away.
"<|emo_fear|> Utah is terrible, I hated driving through there at night"
"<|emo_joy|> That's different lol.. And any positive, faint or not, is a positive!"
<|emo_disgust|> medical care in the US sucks.
<|emo_sad|> I’ve massively improved but it never really gets cured. There are always situations that will give you anxiety.
<|emo_disgust|> Also i think that person is really shitty and I’m sorry you experienced that. People are animals sometimes.
<|emo_anger|> We will never survive with 5% unemployment with moderate growth and a continued house building program to correct supply. Sounds horrendous
"<|emo_fear|> Its horrifying to think about getting separated from your family, friends and the culture you were living into somewhere new and unfamiliar just like that"
"<|emo_surprise|> Love those clips on YouTube, does this add anything to it? Considering Netflix's obsession with exclusivity, this is an unusual arrangement. "
<|emo_sad|> My wife is out for shabbos and I'm so lonely without her :(
<|emo_disgust|> You are retarded
<|emo_sad|> Don't post this on Yelp. She'll hate you for life!
<|emo_joy|> Because it was funny and people liked it. They otherwise do a pretty job of preventing memery
"<|emo_sad|> No, YOU’RE crying!!!!"
<|emo_disgust|> Even worse.
<|emo_fear|> That's what I'm afraid of but I don't have a lot of free time so it would never work.
<|emo_joy|> Dan cool and rich
<|emo_surprise|> Yeah who knows how many indictments [NAME] is gonna rack up retroactively? It could be hundreds! /s
<|emo_disgust|> That's a weird way of spelling Disenchanted
<|emo_anger|> Dont call your self pansexual if you've never deepthroted a pan.
"<|emo_sad|> Saw bad guy, arrested same."
<|emo_fear|> NO GOD NOOOO!
<|emo_anger|> What the fuck is this doing in a cryptocurrency sub
<|emo_anger|> Fucking [NAME] with lazy passes all night long
<|emo_joy|> Wow... I’m so glad that my dog is lazy like me.
<|emo_joy|> I’m glad I’m not the only one who thought that.
"<|emo_fear|> Wow that’s scary, she’s so young and healthy. I hate that. "
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] she wanted this so badly to be a choosingbeggers.
<|emo_joy|> Lol. Your dad made me laugh. Tell him thanks.
"<|emo_joy|> I got matched with the best [NAME] in the world today, it was well fun. Felt happy to win a round ahaha."
<|emo_joy|> It pays well and I enjoy it. I travel 6 months a year. For the last 16 years.
<|emo_joy|> They will be once enough young progressives have replaced the older centrists :) Welcome to the new Democratic Party!
"<|emo_surprise|> It's very rare that I have literally no idea who a player is, but here's one."
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah, he knows about my mental health and how bad it cam get, we've tried all the things that have worked in the past "
<|emo_joy|> I have to cuddle my dog so hard right now.
"<|emo_joy|> Damn, you just reminded me how good that feels..."
<|emo_fear|> That’s scary
<|emo_joy|> It's Incredible! So glad I could help with this! :D
<|emo_joy|> Happy birthday to your friend!
<|emo_surprise|> Oh same here. Too relatable. Makes me wonder what 50 year old me will miss about the body I've got now.
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry, mom took it out of the oven already and I am STARVING!"
<|emo_surprise|> There are so many posts from [NAME] on here it makes me wonder what people think wholesome means.
<|emo_sad|> Maybe the abandonment of his mother. Some people won’t see that as abusive but it really is.
<|emo_anger|> Wow these thots are desperate.
<|emo_anger|> Stop. How can you watch [NAME] these past years and think he has 2-3 years left.
<|emo_disgust|> omg that's gonna be a hell of a reunion as well
<|emo_disgust|> oh yes! i did not know pizza could possibly ever be disgusting until i moved to florida.
<|emo_anger|> Oil barons hate him!
<|emo_joy|> I'm polish too. I love my family but I would never even consider trying to live there trying to be happy.
"<|emo_joy|> Funny, coming from the tool circle jerk reddit."
<|emo_disgust|> On a college campus surrounded by undergrads. I feel old.
<|emo_joy|> I cheered for the Superbowl to be canceled
<|emo_fear|> Is this a real thing? I'm a terrible stoner.
<|emo_joy|> Cheers to you for pushing through.
<|emo_joy|> Didn't even know we were in the running. I thought if he leaves Chelsea he's only going to real ;)
<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I genuinely thought this was funny can’t believe you copped it so hard
<|emo_surprise|> Looks weirdly fake Edit: turns out it’s real
"<|emo_anger|> ""UGH FEMINISM!!! SURELY THATS THE REASON I CANT GET LAID!!!"" see you in hell "
<|emo_disgust|> My only deal breaker would be possessiveness like it is for men bc I only like dating
<|emo_joy|> Why this post is downvoted? It makes me happy to read something like this.
<|emo_anger|> Motherfucker!!
<|emo_anger|> >if your car is so great why do you have to fill it with petrol all the time This is how stupid you sound
"<|emo_joy|> thanks man, i'll do one for him surely, im planning to make one for every player in our squad :)"
<|emo_anger|> You sure its not just the host quitting which disconnects everybody? Happens all the time and its incredibly frustrating.
<|emo_joy|> Glad I took the 1st half spread
<|emo_surprise|> OH MY GOOSE! You got my super obscure reference! I literally squealed out loud when I read this comment.
"<|emo_joy|> Yeah. It didn't even work, that's why nobody went crazy. "
<|emo_surprise|> Beak makes no sense. Well beaks make no sense anyway but this one especially
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry, you misspelled disrespectful. You don't have my trust. Here are the divorce papers."
<|emo_joy|> I love when you get the text afterwards - my last donation apparently saved a life in Cairns! Really cheered me up actually.
<|emo_joy|> Being the most hated team of the refs is fun huh guys?
<|emo_sad|> *[NAME] making [NAME] even more sad.*
<|emo_joy|> For a sec I thought I was on NoSleep. I'm glad no one got hurt.
<|emo_anger|> PATS DEFENSE YOU ARE USELESS.
<|emo_disgust|> .... That literally made my stomach clench. I can't believe they are charged for the samples... Just eww.
<|emo_disgust|> I like [NAME] but he's biased. If he's planning to becoming a real journalist he needs to leave his bias at home.
"<|emo_joy|> For art? I think it's kind of silly, but it's also fun. Let people live :P"
<|emo_fear|> For the love of [NAME] stop making him relevant. Please.
<|emo_joy|> Stop it. You're giving me that warm fuzzies now.
"<|emo_anger|> Kids are curious and brutal. If she actually spoke in front of the class about, she'd probably leave crying."
<|emo_fear|> Probably scared they’re gonna get flashed by a camera.
"<|emo_fear|> Oooh, edgy!"
<|emo_joy|> thanks... I've added both these to my growing animal multi-sub... =D
"<|emo_anger|> What was the ""injustice?"" Nothing happened to him. Assuming his story was not hugely exaggerated to fit the victim card."
<|emo_surprise|> Your son went to school in a treehouse?
<|emo_surprise|> Thank you! I am surprised with the amount of feedback I am getting. I was not careful with my word choice.
"<|emo_surprise|> I’d kind of be kind of shocked if Chili wants us to hit mostly ground balls, especially with how hard the shifts are nowadays. "
<|emo_sad|> I didn't come out [of my mother] drawing [goshdarn] [NAME]
"<|emo_sad|> I have to admit, most of the worst people I have encountered in my life were met while LARPing."
<|emo_disgust|> I'm not even going to read all of that. It is not mindboggling AT ALL. [NAME] is a huge douchebag. The end.
<|emo_surprise|> It's very interesting that the fresh water doesn't just dilute the salt water
<|emo_joy|> Reading some of the stories on this sub make me appreciate my family more.
<|emo_surprise|> omg i have no idea why but i heard this in [NAME]' voice and it was better than a bible.
<|emo_joy|> a partner of mine made it -- it's just about my favorite meme ever
<|emo_anger|> You're not my real mom. I don't have to listen to you. Just because my dad loves you doesn't mean that I have to!
"<|emo_surprise|> Through mutual friends, and online forums. I find out most online shooters are more fun when playing in a party and able to chat."
<|emo_anger|> Im a Florida you racist
<|emo_sad|> I was in the top 3 on solo and lost solely due to buddy having 2 concussions.
<|emo_anger|> Oh *hell* no.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Did u say yes?
<|emo_disgust|> Fuck this boring ass 9-5 corporate bullshit. I feel like starting a podcast about the Bulls.
"<|emo_sad|> If people think that the current migrant/refugee crisis is ""bad"", they have seen nothing."
<|emo_joy|> Good thing the lions no longer run a true 4-3
<|emo_joy|> Come on human let me in it’s cold outside and I want to play.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my god.... They used [NAME] voice!
<|emo_surprise|> Ah! That's not gone well!
<|emo_fear|> Trial by jury of my peers is honestly my worst fear
"<|emo_fear|> I'm worried he's too small. I love his quickness, but sub-170 is scary for a guy that'll be running over the middle."
<|emo_joy|> Haha I was about to say damn she straight up eviscerated her in between bites.
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] fucking christ. When [NAME] came into the league he was pretty much as skinny as [NAME] is now. And look at the dude now.
<|emo_disgust|> Uhhhhhhhhh well that's not good
<|emo_anger|> I hate his hoist a shit shot and throw your legs forward so you can draw a foul on the defender for crowding your landing space.
"<|emo_disgust|> Just ride the subway in NYC and watch how everyone behaves. Don’t stare, though. "
"<|emo_fear|> Kind of wish they recorded a video of the shard of glass moving through the heart, we would all pee a little in our pants."
<|emo_anger|> That is an exceedingly rare failure. I read an article about this guy. He was just stupid and stopped there.
<|emo_surprise|> I thought this was a diary that I wrote in my notebook! I'm almost exactly the same!
<|emo_anger|> your character's so broken!
<|emo_fear|> Bitch real man just panicking purchases a m82 barret..Now excuse me while i hide from my wife for the next month.
<|emo_fear|> I’m guessing you’re talking about when I burned my arm. 2nd degree and luckily no scaring
<|emo_disgust|> Ill take condoms and council tax over dying in horrible pain from typhoid but each to there own.
"<|emo_anger|> >more money than you I seriously, *seriously* doubt that. >doing something before this guys are outta the country Prove it."
"<|emo_surprise|> Not one bit surprising, yet also not really a men’s rights issue"
<|emo_sad|> I was under the impression that [NAME] also has some pretty rough health problems.
<|emo_anger|> Still an ad hominem and not a legitimate argument or counterpoint :)
"<|emo_anger|> Yea, and trading away young players does not make us better."
<|emo_anger|> Come back here and fight me m8
<|emo_anger|> Just throw them into a pool of needles. That'll teach them not to steal ever again.
<|emo_anger|> Fuck [NAME] pai
<|emo_joy|> I was there yesterday. <3
"<|emo_joy|> The best feeling ever was when class was over and it never got to your turn, so you didnt have to present until the next day"
<|emo_surprise|> It is amazing how social media is allowing maniacs to congregate. Social media is very bad for us.
<|emo_disgust|> Thank you! I still cant believe someone could be so selfish and awful and deliberately try to ruin Christmas for kids. So awful.
<|emo_joy|> LOVE THIS!!
<|emo_anger|> What happens when a Jedi gets PTSD? Play this game to find out. Hint: ITS FUCKIN BAD NEWS SON
"<|emo_joy|> That's awful. I'm glad [NAME] doing better, but he might have serious trust issues for life. "
<|emo_anger|> hahahaha yeah you tell him man! fuk da police coming straight from da undagrunnn hahahah just like that song right!
<|emo_surprise|> Was it just me or when they showed the backboard camera did the hoop look like it had a surprised face?
<|emo_sad|> Yes. I hate everything that has to do with my depression.
<|emo_joy|> Thats one way to make political and economic instability sound super fun
"<|emo_sad|> Honestly wish I could do this, I miss my long hair sometimes :("
"<|emo_joy|> Thanks for reply, I'll enjoy reading through the comments... maybe you make a book of it all. "
<|emo_sad|> I'd imagine they're mostly fakes. You'd be uncomfortably warm in a real CG Parka in our climate.
<|emo_disgust|> One of the more disgusting virtue signals I've seen
"<|emo_anger|> I want to bounce a whole roll of quarters off that ass, holy shit."
"<|emo_fear|> The 5 days got an audible ""[NAME]"" out of me. That's terrifying. "
<|emo_disgust|> That’s how I got banned
<|emo_anger|> She's a terrible debater.
<|emo_anger|> Didn't u just say ur new to this? Why are you speaking?
<|emo_anger|> Absolutely this is the kind of absolute hypocrisy that made me leave the church!
"<|emo_joy|> Haha, maybe at the 55 title party in May "
<|emo_joy|> So glad I moved here.
<|emo_fear|> Booping can be dangerous though.
<|emo_joy|> Happy New Year everyone! It’s 11:42 in CA 2019’s almost here
<|emo_joy|> Thank you. And I love your flair. My toddler is the same haha
<|emo_sad|> Dive is boring to watch too after awhile... everything that's repetitive is boring to watch.
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] and [NAME] ... I guess we drank a little too much...
"<|emo_sad|> [NAME] gets a lot of unfair criticism. [NAME], too"
<|emo_anger|> You said that it is a fact that [NAME] is a rapist based on the testimony of 1 person. I merely stated the same argument based on your logic.
<|emo_joy|> I’m dying! Perfect!
<|emo_surprise|> >image management issue Seriously?! I must have missed that.
<|emo_anger|> Then why are you commenting on a thread about that article?
<|emo_disgust|> YOU UNDERESTIMATE MY POWER!!!
<|emo_sad|> Sad and very true though. Case in point.
<|emo_anger|> If your argument is that we shouldn't build bike lanes because of rare inclement weather like yesterday then you just made an argument against roads.
"<|emo_surprise|> Hey, [NAME] nerf to basic damage and no damage mitigation in stealth! Thank [NAME]!"
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry, is Russia depicted in the cartoon?"
<|emo_disgust|> Also convicted of rape. Interesting quote given that context.
<|emo_anger|> This is on a video about electric guitars what the fuck?
<|emo_anger|> Poor poor poor bastard
<|emo_anger|> Fuck you I was in the bed:/
<|emo_disgust|> This is so cruel. I literally feel physically sick.
<|emo_surprise|> What a save!
<|emo_sad|> How sad that you think because [NAME] wants something we should no longer want it. Grow up you child. Life does not revolve around you or [NAME].
<|emo_joy|> Running with a gun and a sensor dart out makes me feel so cool.
<|emo_joy|> Congrats to you
<|emo_sad|> You’re not alone OP. Stay strong. It’s rough now but everything will be back to normal soon.
<|emo_joy|> Happy birthday!
<|emo_joy|> Bless you!
<|emo_joy|> Wow! I feel like a grade A moron
<|emo_anger|> Why would anyone forget how dominant he is? Lmao Oh yea we suck.
<|emo_anger|> I feel your pain. Sitting here wallowing in self pity and anger at how I let myself go!
<|emo_surprise|> What? The claim is 2018 best shooters. Not overall best shooters
<|emo_sad|> My son told me he hates me
<|emo_anger|> >Israel is literally an apartheid state It's literally not and the proliferation of that accusation is based on ignorance and simplistic understanding.
"<|emo_anger|> My name is [NAME]. You killed my father, prepare to die."
<|emo_surprise|> Conservatives now hate dancing... anybody surprised?
"<|emo_anger|> They don’t have one, they just spam and need to be reported."
"<|emo_fear|> My dosage was increased 2 weeks ago and I've noticed the issues getting worse. With your comment, I'm really leaning towards them being side effects."
<|emo_disgust|> Hes literally making 15 an hour
<|emo_surprise|> Omg at this rate he's gonna be in the next smash bros
<|emo_anger|> Bisexuality does not and never has implied gender preference. Assuming that is perpetuating biphobia.
<|emo_sad|> This made me sad. I hope you find happiness.
<|emo_anger|> Shut up and stop trolling. You're not funny
<|emo_anger|> See as sad as I am I can’t hate anyone here.
<|emo_sad|> #QUIT HURTING THE BIRDS
"<|emo_sad|> Well then I feel sorry for men for being such incontrolable sexual beasts I guess. My original answer was sincere, I can't speak for others though."
<|emo_sad|> Oh my gosh. This woman who died also had a son who died. Holy tragedy
<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry I imagine that was devastating.
"<|emo_sad|> Somebody should make this a smaller video to share it around, this poor kid is going through a lot."
<|emo_anger|> WHY HAVE I NOT SEEN YOU? WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?
"<|emo_sad|> RIP [NAME], you were a sweet girl. It's been over 10 years but I still miss you."
"<|emo_disgust|> He’s not wrong, I’m not sure why he’s being downvoted. He’s having an awful year"
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] damit you got me! Take your upvote sir!
<|emo_joy|> Of course! Happy cake day 🎂🎉
<|emo_joy|> This a very obvious joke. Also the old facepalm picture doesn't make your post better.
"<|emo_joy|> Except for ""fighting liberalism"". Happy cake day."
"<|emo_joy|> Glad to hear it’s open again, great spot. I still class climbing Coonowrin as the stupidest thing I’ve ever done."
<|emo_anger|> Nail in the coffin. Sucks that refs always feel the need to call an equalizer penalty
<|emo_fear|> This is pretty worrying and makes me wonder why she can’t. That’s not normal.
<|emo_sad|> A mix of useful idiots and active grifters. It's a sad sign of our culture that these people make a living this way.
"<|emo_disgust|> Those pearls are the worst, ugh."
"<|emo_anger|> Problem is, it is Bantam and younger. I can teach breakouts easy enough and I don't need a panicked D zone to do it."
<|emo_surprise|> Imagine thinking a bigot isn't ignorant
"<|emo_fear|> It's creepy but also sad that the guy was bathing in your fountain, hey at least it wasn't your pool. "
<|emo_sad|> I like it. But I'm not the most fashionable fella out here.
"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, how did they do that? I mean killed Petunias. My pot is from Bunnings as well."
"<|emo_disgust|> Oh so you're being a troll, good to know.. I actually thought for a second that disgusting, freak couples like y'all actually existed"
<|emo_joy|> Glad you answered your own question.
<|emo_joy|> Happy birthday [NAME]
"<|emo_fear|> Fear of powerful women cripples all logic and invokes hysteria in seemingly normal people. For further information, see [NAME] criticism. "
"<|emo_sad|> I am now sad the latest Thief was so mediocre, because the actual City the game took place in was a great little world."
<|emo_anger|> That's... why I'm here.
"<|emo_anger|> More rudeness, misogyny and sexism from [NAME]. If it wasn't so predictable it would be upsetting. [NAME]. "
<|emo_joy|> Yeah more and more I play BFV I just find myself wishing this thing or that thing was more like the old BF’s.
"<|emo_joy|> I see you're a new fan, enjoy your stay!"
<|emo_surprise|> Wow girl where are your BROWS?
<|emo_anger|> The judge wasn’t impartial as decided by the appeal court. The judge needs to be schooled.
<|emo_disgust|> Everyone who is complicit in all this should be punished and questioned as to why they allowed this to happen. Complete disgrace!
<|emo_joy|> Is that why I didn't like the show? Am I too happy?
<|emo_surprise|> Have you read /r/NEET ? You'll find that not all people hate being unemployed - they choose to be unemployed.
<|emo_joy|> Lol maybe he is not but I think my point still stands 😄
<|emo_joy|> They are always a fun time.
"<|emo_disgust|> Your desperate attempts to pretend that this is nothing are...really weird, to be totally honest."
<|emo_disgust|> Not at all. I'm not going to argue with someone who doesn't understand what a strawman is.
"<|emo_surprise|> So, they want a more profitable split? Surprised they wouldn't go for the Discord store then. Didn't it offer even better a split?"
<|emo_surprise|> My heavens people are getting upset about this.
<|emo_surprise|> These comments are in stark contrast to the more level-headed ones in r/news. Wonder why?
<|emo_disgust|> Justice for that horrendous no call
<|emo_disgust|> Oh lord that's nasty. Guess I'm getting some fried chicken tonight.
"<|emo_anger|> If you’re being contentious, then I have no interest in discussing this. There’s plenty of other threads you can search."
<|emo_surprise|> Read in the news yesterday that 3.6 million have lost their insurance since the rump took office. I wonder how many of them died because of it?
<|emo_sad|> Your using emotionl blackmail. Does the vet save cancer or destroy cancer? [NAME] = Vet. Your using babies and all sorts of things to manipulate. Vets only do the right thing.
"<|emo_sad|> > Woo that sadness out Welp, never gonna be able to have a night out on the town again without this coming up"
<|emo_surprise|> It has to include a scene where Polio ruins his childhood. And he learns about raid low-irritant spray. Because that’s a thing I remember.
<|emo_surprise|> It's bad enough when the Jocasta syndrome is one-sided. This is a pile of yikes.
"<|emo_joy|> Sorry, ""semi"". Happy?"
<|emo_sad|> I SWEAR I DIDNT MEAN TO ANSWER 2 HOURS LATER FORGIVE MEEE
<|emo_joy|> That tiny shoulder pad is freaking adorable.
<|emo_surprise|> IANL I have never thought twice about doing a little extra shoveling to help a neighbor. Can't imagine that it could be illegal.
"<|emo_fear|> [NAME], like people making minimum wage are worried about 10% off at their Walmart."
<|emo_disgust|> (apparenlty) a lawyer sending incriminating text message to a paralegal. this has to be really bad lawyer...
"<|emo_sad|> My reaction was a dejected ""ahhhh damn....."""
<|emo_anger|> #Garbage site for assholes
<|emo_disgust|> That looks disgusting.
<|emo_anger|> I think it's a r/fuckyoukaren joke
<|emo_anger|> It regenerates hate. It's hate motivational.
<|emo_joy|> Jokes on you I have one of those fancy electric toothbrush stands!
<|emo_anger|> Drs hate him!
<|emo_sad|> I really pity those unfree Cuban babies. It’s just sad.
<|emo_fear|> This kills the country.
<|emo_anger|> I still hated the system though. I felt penalized for using anything that wasn't the power beam the entire game.
<|emo_sad|> It hurts to snap out of that denial and face the truth your loved ones are dead... I guess.
<|emo_joy|> I’m glad you had a great time here! Wishing you safe travels!
<|emo_sad|> I am really sad because my innocent nieces are brainwashed by my crazy sister
<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised she could operate a suitcase.
<|emo_sad|> Because I was a fan through all of those NFCCG losses...
<|emo_sad|> you got me for a sec. I was like wow.. that's kind of a weird thing to find h-ohhhh damnit! got me. XD
"<|emo_fear|> As a risk analyst, that's a terrible idea, Risk is too high and the benefit to cost ratio is not worth it "
<|emo_anger|> Still concluding I’m disingenuous despite getting your facts wrong. Big ego you’ve got.
"<|emo_anger|> That’s not munchausen. She has a diagnosed illness that’s a terrible, terrible one to suffer from. This is a pretty shitty reply."
<|emo_disgust|> also a harsh NOOOO when disgusted
<|emo_disgust|> (apparenlty) a lawyer sending incriminating text message to a paralegal. this has to be really bad lawyer...
<|emo_anger|> It's alright. This is just an unpleasant memory now. Kind of rude of your brother though!
<|emo_disgust|> I'm so bad playing solo! I guess I need people to help me improve.
<|emo_joy|> Ooof girl...I thought this was satire at first it was so cringe.
<|emo_anger|> yesterday was a fucking travesty to the game of basketball
"<|emo_disgust|> Don't worry, I'll sacrifice myself. Hey u/hellseashell, come over here. wants to call you a piece of shit."
<|emo_sad|> It makes being ugly even more pathetic. All that work just to create suffering.
<|emo_surprise|> My father needs to read this! ...I may be wrong tho
"<|emo_disgust|> Ignore him, he is a spiteful little rat who is mad because someone did something good and it reminds him how pathetic he is."
<|emo_anger|> Really bad trap if noone falls for it
<|emo_anger|> Freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences. This guy missed out hard cause she's smokin' hot.
<|emo_surprise|> That's why it would be amazing if [NAME] or [NAME] pull a Helsinki 2.0 and release a bombshell right before the president's speech tonight.
<|emo_fear|> Besides this and diablo immortal what else did this recently? I feel like there was one more big one but I cant remember what it was.
"<|emo_disgust|> these have to be probably the worst presses ive ever seen, sorry mate"
<|emo_anger|> >Rise of Agon Literally the worst fucking game that man kind has ever managed to accomplish and you call him a carebear? Fuck out of here.
"<|emo_disgust|> But tbh, i dont think i am disgusting, but my feet still get smelly after a while "
<|emo_fear|> What a horrible person
"<|emo_joy|> My favorite social network is Tumblr, they left out this one too. Not exactly an obscure website..."
<|emo_anger|> They’re so angry!
<|emo_anger|> A year ago I said that this continuous ISO by Houston is disgusting to watch. It s still disgusting.
<|emo_anger|> i freaking love five below! Wait no nevermind
"<|emo_joy|> Now if you can teach her english, the real fun starts. "
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is amazing how dare you
"<|emo_joy|> We all were. Because we’re the responsible people watching the show, and not the glorious train wrecks starring in it :)"
<|emo_anger|> Why don’t you just *get the fuck out* of Edmonton if you hate it so much?
"<|emo_joy|> We may not have much connection playerwise anymore, but Flames will always be Mr. [NAME] special Western buddies."
<|emo_fear|> We knows mumps immunity wanes; is it possible for measles immunity to do the same thing? I'm kinda scared to try Googling it too.
"<|emo_disgust|> Not really sweaty palms, but holy hell that's uncomfortable as all hell..."
<|emo_joy|> That is what we love to hear. :) We hope you enjoy the game and that we see you again soon!
<|emo_surprise|> wow that is MINT
"<|emo_anger|>  a thing, and I’ve had my share of Whistle Pig Pie. I hate me "
<|emo_joy|> Happy new year!
<|emo_surprise|> Cos Disneyland is too damn expensive for them these days.
<|emo_anger|> Nothing like a little bit of whataboutism. We can think they're *both* idiots.
<|emo_disgust|> I mostly shooed him away and didnt report him. But no one liked him. It was a short internship.
<|emo_fear|> Soon: Mass death of pink-skinned Aussies.
<|emo_sad|> Those ads actually make me feel bad for financial advisors gouging clients with excessive fees.
"<|emo_sad|> Will see,still better for Chelsea then [NAME] who looked completely lost and devoid of any confidence lately"
<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry [NAME]. I won't do it again.
<|emo_surprise|> I knew a guy named [NAME]. Always wondered what his middle name was.
<|emo_disgust|> Deep blue eyes look weird to me. The rest seems pretty good.
<|emo_joy|> [NAME]. It just seems like it’d be more fun.
<|emo_surprise|> He’s not the brilliant tactician he’s made out to be.
"<|emo_joy|> I have [NAME] hat so I could marry it, flip it and kill it"
<|emo_sad|> Another pathetic PP.
"<|emo_anger|> Nah, you’re pretty fucked given the amount of weed you smoke and the fact you’re planning on finishing your 1.5 grams before the test."
<|emo_surprise|> This is so powerful.
"<|emo_fear|> [NAME] "" haters gonna hate"" the most cringe I've seen of any politician. Worse than [NAME] benefit singing some working class song. "
<|emo_anger|> Neither of them have the IQ for true narcissism!! Stop insulting the intelligence of narcissists [NAME]!
<|emo_joy|> They sure do love their fanfiction!
<|emo_anger|> You’re a vile vile person and a rapist. I hope the police are onto you.
"<|emo_joy|> I recently came upon the term ""that slaps"" in reference to delicious food, or simply an enjoyable experience. "
<|emo_joy|> So glad you got justice and closure. You can properly begin to heal now. I’m not sure I ever will get the same sadly
"<|emo_disgust|> As someone who went through school before the internet existed, yes, weird creepy kids existed. Although it was more in your face. "
<|emo_joy|> My experience has been the opposite. Younger guys are sweeter and try harder- without trying to wife me down. We just have fun together
<|emo_disgust|> Ain’t that the truth. August is Hell!!
<|emo_joy|> you're hilarious. Thanks for the entertainment this morning.
<|emo_disgust|> What if I told you that [NAME] and his supporters don't care about security. They just want to keep brown people out.
<|emo_sad|> I feel bad for laughing at this now that the creator of Spongebob passed away a month ago.
"<|emo_anger|> My anger, up 50%. "
<|emo_disgust|> That is beyond disgusting.
"<|emo_anger|> This is really disgusting, the 4x4 community is one of the nicest around, Shame that a few c*nts gotta do shit like this."
"<|emo_disgust|> ""Feed the wars and fuck the poors"" is pretty much their policy."
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow amazing, anyone know where can I find more at higher resolution?"
"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah I'm actually pretty surprised that's not a thing yet, there's gotta be a lot of people working on it. "
"<|emo_joy|> As far as i can say, my precious arm came back to me hahahaha I'll be sure to tell about my progress, too! Till next time!"
<|emo_anger|> What a waste of money and time
<|emo_disgust|> His video is definitely against the rules.. He literally asks people to spam oh yeah yeah everywhere
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME] would love her!!! ""Do you forgive Daddy?"" "
<|emo_sad|> I had some pretty bad diarrhea right after the game. It's was more enjoyable than that loss.
<|emo_sad|> I’ll see you there. I laughed out loud at this one too. RIP.
"<|emo_anger|> That sounds terrible, man. Have you been to a doctor yet?"
<|emo_fear|> Why am I gonna do? Stop the ant? I’m scared of him too
<|emo_surprise|> wait. So most of south asia doesn't eat rice?
<|emo_surprise|> This is lovely. Didn’t expect the end.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is INSTANT offense when he comes in. Dude is a spark plug out there every night.
<|emo_disgust|> 😂 I’m a [NAME] with a Mexican wife...Based on your comments however that’s all you see and it’s disgusting. GTFO racist
"<|emo_disgust|> Me too, I'm shitting myself."
<|emo_joy|> Happy Cake day.
<|emo_disgust|> I sense no awful taste here.
"<|emo_joy|> Very cool toys, very cool video, very cool hostd"
<|emo_fear|> Oh the horror. I hope she's alright.
<|emo_anger|> (Stupid) * (how many times you think you can pull it off without getting caught )
"<|emo_joy|> Just remember we’re all silly looking, gangly monkey things living on a rock floating through nothing, all trying to be cool. Have fun"
<|emo_surprise|> 21 year old here! I had always wondered when I would feel like an adult... according to this thread looks like it never happens
<|emo_sad|> Yeah I misread
<|emo_sad|> Oh man I feel bad now. If you find it funny than it's funny 💖 sorry
"<|emo_joy|> ""[NAME] has been consistently good against okc"" big faxxx [NAME]"
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME] has been attacking the basket a lot this game,good to see."
<|emo_anger|> Minus the eyebrows I personally think it’s an attractive look. But the fucking eyebrows ruin it all.
<|emo_joy|> Yep. Learned my lesson this time.
"<|emo_anger|>  so just throwing this out there, you can have conversations and arguments without being an ass."
<|emo_disgust|> Get the app - has your combat record and recent match stats..don’t understand the problem.
<|emo_disgust|> His music is bad starting with that yeezus album
<|emo_sad|> I am sad to hear about your cat. Pets become like a family member. I am glad to hear you are doing better.
<|emo_joy|> Baby rape. Can’t make a funny joke about it.
<|emo_anger|> because energy drinks are the most fucked up you can get while still being sober
<|emo_disgust|> This is super duper nasty
<|emo_joy|> Lol. What a great way to start off the morning
<|emo_sad|> U get an updoot from one sad person to another
<|emo_joy|> lol @ the dude lying down in the hut at 2:12
<|emo_surprise|> How tf is this dumbass mf still internet popular like everyone hates him irl
<|emo_anger|> Say it louder for the Dwight’s in the lockers.
<|emo_anger|> If you make them get out in this. You deserved the fucking ticket.
<|emo_sad|> A lot of people call that this is only one they made her sick
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] saved by the very compassion in society that he is trying to destroy.
"<|emo_anger|> She's a person of color, they instantly hate her lol. "
<|emo_sad|> I'm literally screaming.
<|emo_anger|> heck
<|emo_fear|> Because the hierarchy is afraid they’ll get burned.
"<|emo_disgust|> Ugh, sometimes I have both at the same time!"
"<|emo_disgust|> When ever I’m feeling depressed or alone, I’ll just image you and think “it could be worse”."
<|emo_sad|> im still starving
<|emo_sad|> Poison is usually physically damaging
<|emo_fear|> Yawn. They’re toxic together and their only trait seemed to be getting naked together.
<|emo_fear|> I visibly recoiled from that.
<|emo_joy|> Exactly all I hear is about [NAME] and [NAME] and nothing about [NAME] it is crazy.
"<|emo_surprise|> Color me surprised. Take your ""free"" care and like it, peon!"
<|emo_anger|> No...how dare you bring factual evidence into this conversation! /s
<|emo_sad|> Sad but exciting to see him in a place where he might perform well. Hopefully he stays injury free.
<|emo_anger|> i love it but i hate everything around it. I want to theorycraft a deck with all the cards i want without having to spend money.
<|emo_disgust|> That fool does not look like it has been in the oven. It looks like they made a foil bowl and poured whatever that is in there.
<|emo_disgust|> Young [NAME] works to hard for his name to be slandered like this.
<|emo_fear|> Wait so the aboleth only kills you if you dont do what the dm says
<|emo_disgust|> OK. That is really weird.
<|emo_anger|> Having fuck tons of fun right now
<|emo_anger|> Who cares? 2019 season hasn’t even started
<|emo_sad|> Hard. Social anxiety/general fear/uggoness kept me from actually getting dates and i was extremely awkward when I finally stopped anxie-puking to actually go on the date.
"<|emo_joy|> How cute, the JV players are fighting"
<|emo_fear|> > No one bugs me. And yet you're scared to take your family in public because of Patriot Prayer?
"<|emo_anger|> Damn, that was dirty."
<|emo_sad|> Damn it. Don't mention [NAME]. Just makes me sad thinking what could have been.
<|emo_anger|> If this is serious mate it’s not the kind of shit you should be posting on reddit
<|emo_surprise|> That escalated quickly
<|emo_disgust|> Not ok. They could have easily given them a drug test if they really wanted to know if they were on drugs. Disgusting.
"<|emo_sad|> Got a bit tipsy in my room alone, dancing in my underwear to some cheesy music for the whole night, and then cried myself to sleep"
<|emo_joy|> I actually really liked that you added in your personal interests. I like Korean boy bands too.
<|emo_anger|> DONT BE TRUE
<|emo_joy|> The coolest of beans my friend
<|emo_sad|> I feel ya.
<|emo_anger|> We gotta throw the whole world away
"<|emo_sad|> Absolutely is, sorry. I just came by to say Howdy back until I saw all the hubbah. [NAME]. "
<|emo_surprise|> The level of denial the top boys reached was astonishing.
<|emo_disgust|> The rare times when they can be arsed to start their own conversation they always talk about why feminism is actually to blame.
<|emo_surprise|> Wha? I’m so confused. I’m so sorry this happened because it wasn’t remotely warranted.
<|emo_anger|> ROOMS TO GO LOUNGE TIME
<|emo_surprise|> Went on a date with someone whose 8 years older than me. She didn't realize I was only 20. Whoops.
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] fucking [NAME]. You'd think strangling someone until they're unconscious would be *attempted murder,* not just second degree assault."
"<|emo_sad|> says you, too bad you're totally wrong."
<|emo_surprise|> It’s news to me🤪
"<|emo_joy|> I like this template, it makes me happy."
<|emo_sad|> I was getting arrested and my dog run away from home like a bullet
<|emo_anger|> Surprised [NAME] didn't add his hatred of interracial couples in the movie.
<|emo_joy|> hahaha. best response I've seen in a few days
<|emo_sad|> So true it hurts.
"<|emo_disgust|> Well, that sucks"
<|emo_joy|> This makes me smile
"<|emo_joy|> I am not regreting my life, there is so much interesting stuff on the internet"
<|emo_disgust|> Block him and stop replying to his comments. Not worth it.
<|emo_joy|> AS..... YOU.... WISSHHH!!!.. Inconceivable! My first ever silver. Thank you kind stranger.
"<|emo_anger|> >Is this battle the fate of the galaxy or not? If nobody else cares, why should we? Nailed it."
<|emo_joy|> One of the 7 dwarfs is called happy
<|emo_anger|> I blame [NAME].
<|emo_disgust|> Wow I got a virus from just looking at this post
<|emo_sad|> Gotta cheat on taxes somehow LOL
"<|emo_anger|> Too lazy to type out ""him/her"" 3x. That and I don't give a fuck."
<|emo_surprise|> I'm suprised I didn't see more of these. Thanks for the support :)
<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised he hasn't already. He was charged on Dec. 31st but his name was only released yesterday.
<|emo_disgust|> I'm just an idiot on the internet. I don't know a doggam thing.
<|emo_anger|> whyyyyy !!!! ughhh
"<|emo_surprise|> Now I'm wondering if [NAME] drinks, and if he's ever been inebriated during one of his deals."
<|emo_joy|> Really? Everything seems pretty in order to me
<|emo_disgust|> Any good reading on [NAME]? I don't really know if I like her or not.
<|emo_sad|> Levels mate. Absolutely obsessed with our dominance.
<|emo_joy|> happy cake day
"<|emo_joy|> Eh, keep it here. There's plenty of need for content that isn't about politics or antisemitism. Food is fun for everyone to talk about."
<|emo_joy|> Happy cake day Mr bot
"<|emo_joy|> I will say, this tanking season is a lot more enjoyable than [NAME] cause we don't see [NAME] looking confused on the sideline every game."
"<|emo_anger|> I already told you, food poisoning or allergic foods. The real greedy snake oil salesmen are big pharma."
<|emo_joy|> It is fascinating that people spend billions of dollars on superhero fantasy yet they hate a real life superhero.
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] stopped napping at 18 months. We’ve been implementing quiet time since. It’s wondrous.
<|emo_anger|> Pretty and sweet? BURN HER ALIVE!! Nothing can detract from their beliefs!
"<|emo_anger|> Honestly, fuck [NAME] after the bounty gate shit"
<|emo_fear|> My poor space bar takes an awful bashing with all the pausing in a Squidge vid
<|emo_surprise|> The claim that whole milk is 40% fat is surprisingly not the most absurd part of this picture. /j
"<|emo_joy|> 😂 Dude, ok your cool now"
<|emo_anger|> You are an asshole.
"<|emo_sad|> My favorite pod when they are fresh & clear. Sadly, all of my recent packs look like dark brown syrup pods. "
<|emo_fear|> The pistons are aggressively mediocre which sucks. [NAME] has been awesome but the rest of the team is horrid
<|emo_surprise|> I can't even be mad that you scored a goal with your face.
<|emo_joy|> This will forever be my most fav April moment!
<|emo_anger|> The worst thing about this tweet is how many likes and retweets it got
<|emo_anger|> Ah damn it.
<|emo_disgust|> >it tasted horrible to use. Eating some of that right now. No regrets.
<|emo_joy|> I love the way he starts kicking the guy while holding the 2 Ak's
<|emo_fear|> The fact that this being brought up makes it a real scary feeling.
<|emo_joy|> ROFL! Just about! Didn’t know someone’s eyes could bug out of their head like that outside of cartoons. ;-)
<|emo_anger|> facetune is hard work you fucking pore. I work all day to support this family and this is the thanks I get?
<|emo_fear|> he is a very dangerous man
<|emo_anger|> This sub can be so ridiculously cynical. It's just a pretty picture of a sign!
<|emo_fear|> AHHHH ZIMM!
"<|emo_anger|> ""Don't be stupid and be a smarty, come and join the Nazi party !"""
<|emo_joy|> Wow that was ...mind blowing.
<|emo_anger|> Yeah. I killed them both.
<|emo_surprise|> Omg I'm crying and shaking rn [NAME] would never say that
"<|emo_sad|> Ah, I work 9-5 :( but I appreciate the invite!"
<|emo_anger|> It doesn't really matter because since BF came out on console it's slowly become shit. :)
<|emo_anger|> Get outta here and delete your post cause you're sure gonna look dumb in front of a lot of people other than me.
"<|emo_joy|> Right now I'm listening to Stand By Me, I'm liking it "
<|emo_joy|> Lol this ockanikin! I used to love coming here for summer camp when I was in cub/Boy Scouts!
"<|emo_fear|> Whoa, should've said that in the post. Threats is not good. I'd find a way to live away from him asap. "
<|emo_joy|> Fuck [NAME] for blocking funding for this for years and years. So glad it's being used to help people now
<|emo_anger|> The only life that needs to be ended here is the life of the guy that raped your daughter. Abortion is just medicine
<|emo_fear|> Oh [NAME] if you ever burn anything you will never live it down.
"<|emo_disgust|> I want to say I'm shocked. I'm not. Disgusted, but not shocked."
<|emo_anger|> Fucking hell! I've been out there protesting orange people all this time. I need funding for new signs!
"<|emo_surprise|> So, [NAME] and [NAME] are over? Have to wonder why he thought marrying a 19 year old was the best thing to do!"
<|emo_sad|> Laws don’t apply when you’ve got money. Sad but true.
<|emo_surprise|> It's always been Marfeles. Was 30 years ago when I first visited.
<|emo_anger|> Dumb people. Poor person. The wolf was the only one who wanted to help!
"<|emo_joy|> I like saying the n-word, it makes me happy"
"<|emo_joy|> Ah, victory "
<|emo_anger|> It makes me mad when people steal them lol... chances are if you're nice I'll just *give* it to you
<|emo_disgust|> Fuck the HRC
"<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry OP, every single thing on that list is incredibly wrong. I hope you're doing well now. "
<|emo_surprise|> A surprise turn of events! I'm so glad you heard such great things about yourself!
<|emo_joy|> It’s like bombs over Baghdad to a whole new level... I LOVE IT!!
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry, didn't know where else to put it"
<|emo_sad|> That was painful.
<|emo_joy|> a lot. It's like I'm witnessing firsthand all of the unpleasant symptoms of being pregnant
"<|emo_surprise|> I was shocked. They were talking earlier on the news about her losing by less than 100 being a victory, of sorts."
"<|emo_disgust|> Tfw when not only is it tiny, but it’s damn ugly too. :( "
<|emo_sad|> The other person was [NAME] on Hell's Kitchen. Shot herself in 2007.
<|emo_disgust|> Taliban is the worst.
<|emo_joy|> Sakura drops & Goodbye happiness
"<|emo_anger|> Adjust your W4. Everyone has to pay taxes, so save it with the ""I have to send a check to the government!"" BS. "
<|emo_joy|> Argentina is with you! Be strong comrades!
<|emo_anger|> That LOD is a moron
<|emo_sad|> Sorry you had to live there. Good news is they are demolishing it in 2020.
<|emo_joy|> Videos. It’s basically a gif with sound. Pretty cool to see them in action
<|emo_anger|> What? Shut up?
<|emo_disgust|> This is so creepy. Good riddance to awful rubbish.
<|emo_surprise|> This caught me off guard for real. I actually off my bed laughing. +1
<|emo_sad|> Struggling to find :(
<|emo_surprise|> You president now?
<|emo_fear|> That’s nightmare fuel right there
<|emo_sad|> We have no other winger bro....
<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry for your loss. From the picture it looks like he had a great life if that helps
<|emo_anger|> I understand just so hard feels like I’m being thrown away like trash I don’t want to imagine a life without her in it
<|emo_sad|> I’m sorry but I don’t think you do
<|emo_surprise|> I think it was roughing and unsportsmanlike conduct for the chirp or something stupid like that. I couldn't believe [NAME] got away with that
"<|emo_joy|> No problem at all, glad I could help :) Cheers!"
<|emo_joy|> Monero enthusiast here. Make me happy and call me a liar again.
<|emo_surprise|> I’m the most surprised that [NAME] is 35. Seems like just yesterday he was plotting with [NAME] on how to get booze for the party
<|emo_sad|> What would that do? So you’re saying I’m 100% gonna be diabetic
<|emo_joy|> See this guy gets it!
<|emo_sad|> So sad—but not surprising. It would be interesting to know if there’s a difference between countries with and without socialised health care.
<|emo_disgust|> When you glossed over [NAME] history to make a cheap shot at a democrat. That type of dishonesty is kind of your trademark
"<|emo_fear|> Relatedly, my legs are lean because I run away from my problems."
"<|emo_fear|> Im not a brexiter. In fact, this is my concern with a second referendum. I'm worried that remain will lose."
"<|emo_fear|> Those are horrible things to say to a child, let alone a 3 yr old. I would be pissed!"
<|emo_sad|> are your feelings hurt?
<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe people voted us to beat Sydney. I've become extremely optimistic over the past few months and even i voted Sydney.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh I wouldn't be surprised my dad got away with some shocking things despite cps investigation but he was also white.
<|emo_anger|> The [NAME] excuse needs to die. [NAME] was on the bench for an extended period when the Raps defence made [NAME] freaking [NAME] look like an all-star.
<|emo_joy|> Cheers! *clink*
"<|emo_disgust|> ick! That makes me feel gross. I have ""Addison's Disease"". "
<|emo_surprise|> I can never refold the paper properly so kudos just for that!
<|emo_anger|> That has gotten me killed a few times lately.
<|emo_surprise|> This must have been the fastest reply I've ever gotten omg
<|emo_fear|> I just had a panic attack!
<|emo_surprise|> nah man im just shook and dead™️
"<|emo_sad|> This is sad but not cringe, I hope he finds someone to play with soon 😪"
<|emo_anger|> Willing to get with someone manipulative and knowing this just to get some ass. Seen that a lot.
<|emo_surprise|> Confound your toll Troll!
<|emo_anger|> shut your deregulating lying mouth bill
<|emo_anger|> Hey we have feelings too nerd
<|emo_joy|> Sometimes I just go on the YouTube video for any song older than like 20 years and these comments never disappoint
<|emo_joy|> I was banned for criticizing the authoritarian mods and now I’m back! Feels good to have the subreddit return to the principles of freedom of expression.
<|emo_joy|> That was brutal as hell. Loved it
<|emo_surprise|> I was one of the best. I used to get at least 50 matches. Hair loss made me invisible all of the sudden
<|emo_anger|> This is my biggest pet hate of all time!
"<|emo_joy|> I like to answer ""CALLER 7, YOU ARE LIVE ON THE AIR!"""
"<|emo_surprise|> Is it only possible for men to be crossdressers? I’ve never heard a woman called that, even if she’s dressed like a man."
<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry for your loss. Also send a Mass card.
<|emo_anger|> DONT BE NEEDY. TALK TO OTHER GIRLS.
"<|emo_disgust|> Me too, I'm shitting myself."
<|emo_joy|> Happy new years!!!!
"<|emo_anger|> They understand alright, they just don't give a shit. Bunch of fucking scum."
<|emo_joy|> Here's a purple heart for you recapping that! OMG matching romantic scoots I'm cryin'
"<|emo_joy|> i don't usually 'wall of text' posts but i'm glad i made your post an exception. thank you, it brought tears to my eyes."
<|emo_surprise|> I can’t believe that’s real
<|emo_joy|> Yeah that's funny. Girl who didn't like that is probably some [NAME] wannabe thot.
<|emo_anger|> Seek out a therapist? It sounds quite depressing n I wouldn't want it overwheming me.
<|emo_fear|> >it tasted horrible to use. Eating some of that right now. No regrets.
<|emo_surprise|> Yheaaa I always gave me till 35 to decide if I want a kid or not. [NAME] kicked in sooner than expected.
<|emo_sad|> alright yeah guess i am stupid
<|emo_anger|> Someone tell me why they are out passing us they taking the game to us when we should be controlling the tempo of the ball to keep the lead.
<|emo_joy|> A surprise turn of events! I'm so glad you heard such great things about yourself!
<|emo_disgust|> It feels weird reading a VICE article talking about itself in the third person.
<|emo_disgust|> Weird combinaison of letters for french poeple
<|emo_disgust|> Yes. I got accused of being a man or a bootlicker because I was a mod in a men's lib sub two years ago.
"<|emo_sad|> OMG, crying laughing right now. Hubs and I both. What a visual!"
<|emo_sad|> this is so sad Alexa play despacito
"<|emo_joy|> I'm just gonna hit ""back"" now. See you guys."
<|emo_anger|> You fucked up. You trusted them.
"<|emo_joy|> Jokes aside, is anyone on the dev team? ~~taking even a remote look at [NAME]?~~ Fixed for you. LAWL"
<|emo_joy|> You're in for a treat- enjoy :)
"<|emo_fear|> I'm more worried about him scamming children than ""oNLY"" scamming them into thinking they'll get $100."
<|emo_surprise|> Surprises me how a dude that let his keyboard get to this point even cares enough to clip his nails in the first place.
"<|emo_sad|> Lost my only grandfather two years ago to Alzheimer's, this is great news knowingly this disease sucks"
<|emo_sad|> I do but no one wants to play with me I at least try to play by my self but it gets really boring.
<|emo_surprise|> I would be surprised if she's doesn't have at least 1 kid
<|emo_disgust|> I like the Canucks. And I hate the leafs and rags sooo I’m on board.
"<|emo_anger|> I'll chase you till the ends of the eaaaaarth, Shooooooooooooooooooooooooooocker!!!!!!!"
<|emo_anger|> All the centrist liberals in the comments are furious...
<|emo_fear|> Horrible waste of time.
<|emo_joy|> So very sweet! Brotherly love
"<|emo_fear|> Help, I'm scared and want to go back."
<|emo_sad|> So sorry to hear about your abnormal growth. I'm now green with envy. Are there other celestial gods that can identify with existence?
<|emo_joy|> Fuck yeah dude. I need pizza now also. The beer and bourbon are flowing nicely. Cheers and happy New year
<|emo_joy|> Squeak the toy! Ball makes everything better!
<|emo_joy|> Splash your face with cold water. Refresh.
<|emo_sad|> French fried when he should have pizza'd and had a bad time.
"<|emo_sad|> Spoiler alert, it's terrifying and depressiong"
<|emo_fear|> That's the stuff of nightmares right there
<|emo_joy|> Sounds like a fun game. Our home game around here is .05/.10. Its fun but not very exciting.
<|emo_joy|> Like a three dollar forty bag of fresh hiphop?
<|emo_disgust|> I know a guy who is 25 (same age as me) and has FOUR. I would hate my life so much.
<|emo_sad|> The planet is being destroyed. ***yEaH bUt TaXaTiOn Is ThEfT!***
<|emo_anger|> Literally right after I sent it. What the hell
"<|emo_joy|> Messages like this will always get replies from me, even if it had been about erm punching me?!"
<|emo_sad|> There it is. I knew I wasn't the only one bothered by this.
<|emo_anger|> For real. I get tired of all the griping. Deal with it or get out.. or start a freaking riot and make changes.
<|emo_surprise|> I think Judge came in a little too late so he’ll need to be amazing for the next 8 years
<|emo_joy|> Well said. Glad to see that there are still open minded people left in this sub.
<|emo_surprise|> This is doubtful...he just won with over 50 percent
<|emo_anger|> Move bitch get out the way.
"<|emo_sad|> just did, feel free to repost from r/uplifting news"
<|emo_disgust|> just fed up of reading subjective opinions be paraded as fact that he was the worse ever.
<|emo_anger|> An angry old person yelling at a retail worker will never listen to reason.
"<|emo_disgust|> Sounds like my SIL with me/hubby. But she's a bitch and we never liked her anyways, so neither of us really care lol. "
"<|emo_fear|> Help, I'm scared and want to go back."
"<|emo_anger|> Yeah, he does. Just because he draws different conclusions than you doesn't mean he isn't reading [NAME]. Get out of your little bubble."
<|emo_joy|> They're both happy though
"<|emo_anger|> Don't ""neg"" the university (or any university) and don't write about doing illegal, unethical, or immoral activities. "

<|emo_joy|> It was magic.
<|emo_surprise|> We're one in the same!!!!!!!!!!!😂😂😂😂
<|emo_fear|> Just says that [NAME] is his new main man. Doubt it was an intentional dig at [NAME] but it sure feels like it.
"<|emo_surprise|> Whoa, thanks for the in depth answer! "
<|emo_disgust|> The main reason I left is a hidden mmr used to influence matchmaking in a mode that requires a paid entry. That's disgusting
<|emo_fear|> I work on a farm. I can confirm can be dangerous. I have a hard time imagining a scenario where being a cop is more dangerous.
"<|emo_sad|> Apologies, that distinction always slips my mind lol"
<|emo_surprise|> Omg didn't even think of that! So clever! Yes!
<|emo_sad|> Been getting this same feeling these days.. idk what it is I just have no drive anymore maybe once the cwl comes back it’ll help
<|emo_sad|> Right... so true. I’m sorry you’re going through this too.
"<|emo_sad|> Great, now my balls hurt and I’m yawning uncontrollably. "
<|emo_disgust|> I hope that's a bug because it looks downright embarrassingly bad
<|emo_sad|> He did get 3 stars bro😭
<|emo_anger|> Burn themall!!!!
<|emo_surprise|> Thank you! I was wondering what to do tomorrow morning. Now I have something to go to.

<|emo_disgust|> Damn this kid and her fancy clothes makes me feel like a bad parent.
<|emo_joy|> Id gladly exchange firsts with the Suns
"<|emo_anger|> Sure let's leave a bomb outside a [RELIGION] secondary school, that'll show the [NAME]!"
<|emo_anger|> I refuse to read him any more. Just another [RELIGION] man getting a slap on the hand & a cover up job.
"<|emo_anger|> I actually see this one a lot. ""Allergy: fire ants."" Me too, bro. Ants will fuck you up."
<|emo_sad|> Your brother is in a freak cult that ruins lives. Forgive him but don’t listen to that bs.
<|emo_fear|> Pure unconsitional love can also be dangerous: if the other person turns out to be an abuser you should propably stop loving them
<|emo_disgust|> pretty much correct except for when right wingers get triggered they type on a keyboard and when leftists get triggered they try and ruin the career of whatever offended them
<|emo_anger|> Overhead fans are absolute shit. They literally do nothing but blow dust around.
<|emo_disgust|> This is my biggest pet hate of all time!
<|emo_sad|> Poor cat.
<|emo_sad|> This chick is a lunatic now
"<|emo_anger|> Blow me you feckless moron, I was out of state. "

<|emo_surprise|> These are the signs I'm getting old... Wtf is a weed cartridge??

"<|emo_sad|> I’m sorry if I hurt your fragile ego, you should get off the internet lol"
"<|emo_disgust|> You are the worst kind of person, but i love it"
<|emo_disgust|> Well one of them is a dirty kimono wearing weirdo
<|emo_joy|> This bit was more fun than it should have been.
<|emo_sad|> It usually comes out after people catch me dissociating.
<|emo_fear|> Team Arrow getting stalked and sent threatening notes Also I'm :( for the [NAME] part.
<|emo_disgust|> SWTOR is horrible when you want to play together with someone. So many parts that you can't join in on.
<|emo_anger|> Tell him he should get a divorce.
<|emo_anger|> Vanillas dope tho
<|emo_surprise|> But the right to not have your property taken away from you is a right.
<|emo_sad|> That is utterly horrifying. I'm so sorry that your kindergarten teacher was such a heartless old bat.
<|emo_anger|> When [NAME] dated the nurse just for drama with the STI....
"<|emo_fear|> I am afraid to look, but my morbid curiosity draws me to ask."
<|emo_joy|> I enjoy living the lie. I do it everyday
<|emo_surprise|> It was shocking to me when I realized this! Best of luck on your journey!
<|emo_anger|> Now I wanna know how the hell did you stole the body of an NPC :o

<|emo_joy|> I like it so far I’d heard of it ages ago just never got round to watching it.
<|emo_disgust|> So you're proudly ignorant. Cool bruh
"<|emo_sad|> I was told that upon waking up from a surgery, my first phrase was “don’t Terri [NAME] me” ☹️"
<|emo_disgust|> You don't follow [NAME]. You're a hypocrite following man's interpretation of the word of [NAME]. Youre too stupid to even be embarrassed.
<|emo_sad|> True. Icing all three of your villains for the duration of the film is a bad idea. They need to be making moves.
<|emo_disgust|> Every Saturday for the foreseeable future will be spent studying for the LSAT. Fuck
<|emo_sad|> For sure...sometimes I feel like I will just evaporate into nothingness as the stranger in the mirror looks on.
<|emo_joy|> Thanks! I’m Excited To See How This Meme Become In The Future!
<|emo_anger|> Let their deaths be swift
<|emo_joy|> Glad to see you guys are treating him well

<|emo_fear|> It sounds like that’s the bigger problem here.
<|emo_disgust|> His hair looks fucking horrible 😂
<|emo_joy|> makeup call lol
"<|emo_anger|> I'd hardly call them innocent if they're reveling in the thought of more mass shootings. People like that deserve worse, quite frankly."
<|emo_joy|> Always happy to help
"<|emo_disgust|> 100% agree. Double standards are ever present. Young girl is sexualised, the whole world goes nuts, but a young boy is somehow perfectly acceptable. It's disgusting. "
<|emo_joy|> I’m really glad to read that ex-spouses are friends after. Good for you all!
<|emo_anger|> Why the fuck would I post something on r/niceguys and pretend to be the woman talking shit about myself?
<|emo_anger|> My point is that since they should both get the same sentence...it doesn't matter who is who. Push them both in...
"<|emo_sad|> IT MUST WOUND YOUR PRIDE! STANDING OUT THERE, LIKE A GLORIFIED SENTRY!"
<|emo_sad|> we can only hope

"<|emo_sad|> ""Why everyone hurts me?"""
<|emo_anger|> That is so sick. That kid will feel sooo awesome later in life. What doctor agreed to this though?
"<|emo_surprise|> Yes, because private matches are a thing. Surprised no one else has mentioned that one."
"<|emo_fear|> I'm really worried :( I sent a DM to them, I hope they will be okay... "
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] just wants to post pics of her facetuned of herself for attention while acting morally superior to those other girls. fuck off
"<|emo_surprise|> Lol, I’m surprised more people didn’t catch that. Thanks for the med check! "
"<|emo_surprise|> omg what a nightmare, I feel for you 😞 is there any way you could order it online?"
<|emo_disgust|> Looks like you got it bad. How soon till you can get out on your own?
<|emo_joy|> Damn I didn't realize we just locked up the season series against the jets. That's good to see.
<|emo_fear|> No...how dare you bring factual evidence into this conversation! /s
<|emo_fear|> I watched a really bad horror movie she starred in but I think it predated VPR.

<|emo_disgust|> medical care in the US sucks.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh okay ya never heard it called fabrics
"<|emo_surprise|> 53 months?? That is insane, must've been a different type of octopus then the one I was learning about. "
<|emo_disgust|> Shit out to my little hommies who's parents made them go to school today.
<|emo_joy|> I actually enjoy watching this while eating
<|emo_joy|> Now this I like.
<|emo_disgust|> Thats even worse than what you put up (no offense really). Your work is well done just a hideous design.
<|emo_surprise|> What a nasty goal! Gives you chills!
"<|emo_joy|> Wow, that was fast"
<|emo_joy|> I'm good. Happy with my boyfriend.
<|emo_joy|> He’s got no options. Not your problem. Have another wine! 😂

<|emo_disgust|> It’s disgusting
"<|emo_sad|> Crating your dog is also banned in some places, that doesn't make it cruel."
"<|emo_anger|> You think that hearing deathcries is **funny** ? Personally, hearing cries of pain and dispair don't cause me enjoyment, but I guess I'm a weirdo."
<|emo_surprise|> How did this not get marked as meta? Tried posting something similar here and it was instantly flagged as “meta commentary about the sub” and blocked.
<|emo_sad|> why are other dashers such [NAME] 🤣who made y’all so upset
<|emo_fear|> If this is true 2020 is done. We won't have control of the presidency or Congress for decades.
<|emo_joy|> I have been contemplating taking him to a TLM. You are awesome!
"<|emo_disgust|> I watched that worm fish sauce thing. So gross, disgusting, bleh, NO,NO, and HELL NO!!"
<|emo_joy|> I always thought of the sound of lakes freezing on cold nights. It's pretty surreal in itself.
<|emo_disgust|> Greasy bastards are getting part of what they deserve. Some fines just don’t seem to be enough sometimes
"<|emo_anger|> No, the teens were not being assholes. The original sentiment that spread like wildfire absolutely does not stand."
<|emo_anger|> Yes get [NAME] almost all the way the fuck out of here.
<|emo_joy|> Awesome! Welcome aboard! I'm glad your first game was a win!
<|emo_surprise|> Has he?
<|emo_fear|> Something would go terribly wrong for [NAME] causing him to have to leave. It’s how his ability works.

<|emo_fear|> So edgy.

<|emo_sad|> No babies for him!
<|emo_sad|> Definite Fridge Horror moment for that movie. That poor man.
<|emo_disgust|> Weird I can relate to this but in the same time I can't relate to this
"<|emo_sad|> As an [NAME], I apologize for the cranky old conservatives who are probably making ridiculously uninformed comments about your country right now :/"
<|emo_fear|> He's so intimidating...
<|emo_surprise|> Unrelated but wow I’m so proud that I can read like 70-80 percent of this because I studied Chinese for 3 years. 加油！在中国你做什么？
<|emo_surprise|> Really? I could've sworn I've seen people disabling comments on certain posts before..
<|emo_sad|> Sad but exciting to see him in a place where he might perform well. Hopefully he stays injury free.
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry man, I have no idea either! "
<|emo_anger|> It is so crazy to me that people unironcally use “kicks their trash”. I guess they just don’t want to swear.
"<|emo_anger|> Don't blame me, I voted for Kodos."
<|emo_anger|> 1. Dr. [NAME] job is just cause drama and look frustrated 2. I wanna know the mothers of people ITT

"<|emo_surprise|> What a very ""centrist"" thing to say. "
"<|emo_disgust|> Yes, this is karma farming and it is disgusting to do that, BUT the title *could* be correct. It probably is made up though. "
"<|emo_sad|> Please, please, please don't do that to yourself. You'll end feeling worse when this guy leaves you. "
<|emo_anger|> Damn why’d you have to do him like that😂
<|emo_anger|> He’s going to the Bengals at 11 and I hate it so much
<|emo_joy|> Big thanks to OP for that magnificent wall. I guess that we can reopen the government now.
<|emo_anger|> I just see a car incessantly hogging the middle lane despite being undertaken on the inside!
<|emo_anger|> What a complete and utter cunt.
"<|emo_joy|> I downloaded this album yesterday, and love it!"
<|emo_disgust|> I would agree. It's unfortunate and brutal in its content and in the responses in the thread
<|emo_surprise|> Yikes. I was kind of excited to get a new [NAME] if he gets last man in but I'll pass on these butt ugly jerseys.
<|emo_joy|> No need for pity! It was a happy moment. Tears of joy not sadness
<|emo_joy|> Yup if you’re ahead and just want to spam actives I enjoy it with an upgraded cursed ankh to really hurt healing based teams
<|emo_joy|> It always makes me super happy when I see stuff like this. Go live your best life girl!
"<|emo_joy|> Great questions. I don't have the answer, but I'm happy that were starting to discuss it."
<|emo_surprise|> wow bailed tf out
"<|emo_surprise|> Hey, it's working again! Somebody at YouTube must have given the server a whack, because suddenly the recommendations are making sense. I wonder what happened today."
"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] 👩👩👩 this Is for real, this makeup 💄 💄💋 makes you glow 🌟✨ no 🚫🚫🚫🚫 filters needed 💯💯💯💯💯"
<|emo_surprise|> Why do we even try to have nice things T_T
<|emo_disgust|> Some things are worse than death. Being a dairy farm cow is one of those.
<|emo_sad|> If it makes you feel better im gonna be scrubbing out hard for a while so maybe ill see you round to give me another loss
"<|emo_sad|> Just next her. She'll never find a SD anyway, she's all talk."
<|emo_fear|> Levels mate. Absolutely obsessed with our dominance.
<|emo_surprise|> You haven’t missed anything. I looked out of curiosity and didn’t look twice. I was surprised that Colt would do that.
<|emo_anger|> FIRE THE MEDICAL TEAM.
<|emo_surprise|> Actually pretty surprised that they made it fit as well as this.
<|emo_anger|> I heard [NAME] was an absolute monster too... Jk folks
"<|emo_anger|> It's hard to have a nuanced opinion, innit? But I don't like everything he does. This is one if them."
<|emo_disgust|> I knew this was stupid when the shittastic music came on.
<|emo_fear|> “I got five on it” for the movie US is decent as well. They made it so creepy.
"<|emo_sad|> It'll get better. I know sometimes it's hard to believe that, but it's true. Promise."
<|emo_joy|> Makes my skin crawl
<|emo_sad|> Oh my [NAME] coco I’m so sorry sweety
<|emo_surprise|> I wasn’t even expecting the reply that’s why I’m literally bamboozled.
<|emo_sad|> Because learning another language is cultural appropriation. This people are pathetic.
<|emo_joy|> Your wife is very lucky to have you. I hope my WS feels like this one day. I pray for it every night.
"<|emo_joy|> I got to see some fish at a science museum not long ago and it really brightened my day, too."
"<|emo_joy|> That’s why it’s petty revenge. It may have been petty to take a bit of enjoyment in it, but she made her own bed"
<|emo_joy|> I'm just happy I have the Pen to watch and listen too when the Steelers are on the brink of collapsing...PLUS no locker room drama...
<|emo_disgust|> Fuck her. I hate her so much. I wish she’s just vanish back to Indonesia with her mustache.
<|emo_anger|> Shawty whats wrong with you. I want those people dead
<|emo_disgust|> He posted about white racists on a post that has nothing to do about racism. Pretty sure he is just racist.
<|emo_joy|> LOL at the tldr. What a crazy story. I'm glad the writer got some friendly new relatives out of it.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I’ve never seen so many deleted comments, and that’s saying something."
<|emo_anger|> Stop lying to me
<|emo_joy|> I am the proud owner of a Vernon Gholston jersey. My wife got it for me as a Christmas Gift our first year dating....
<|emo_joy|> I'M MOTIVATED!
<|emo_surprise|> My goodness I didn't even know this existed. This is my first time seeing something like this. Pretty cool stuff.
"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah this bothers me. Family should be off limits, and this scene was really sad"
<|emo_joy|> I admit I’ll be fairly happy if we continue to invest in young internationals and sign a $100+ mil free agent every offseason.
"<|emo_anger|> That goes both ways, their adrenaline and determination would also be through the fucking roof."
"<|emo_disgust|> Are you implying that I can not determine guilt by seeing a person's skin color and tense smile, you fucking racist?"
"<|emo_fear|> >It would also open the possibility of selling the [NAME] arms, I guess. That would be a terrible idea."
<|emo_fear|> Before we start obvi. I’m taking out legs before I get embarrassed.
<|emo_joy|> Well good for you man. Enjoy :)
<|emo_disgust|> Shitpost from the uncultured
<|emo_sad|> Ok cheers. I’m banned from there
<|emo_sad|> When [NAME] breaks [NAME] jaw in “The Sound Of Silence” I’m cringing just thinking about it
<|emo_sad|> This stresses me out way too much.
<|emo_fear|> I will not being awkward if I am being myself but I just scared
"<|emo_fear|> Matchroom squad dismiss [NAME] as not existing anymore, the sky media influence is scary "
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad you made a Reddit account to inform us how much you totes don't care bro
<|emo_joy|> Yeah come back. You are like the coolest most chill dude on Reddit.
<|emo_disgust|> Well who knows what valve thinks. I don’t like Lyrical and Maut either.
<|emo_anger|> Oh shut up. Quit being dramatic. Another option is... THEY COULD HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT.
<|emo_joy|> Wall St is scared of the 2020 Democratic primary.. Good!
"<|emo_anger|> Anarchist to cop: ""Stop beating people!"" Cop: ""Stop imposing your morality on me, you lifestylist!"""
"<|emo_anger|> Debunked as in proven wrong. Again, he is a well known fool. Do yourself a favor and never take anything he says remotely seriously. "
"<|emo_sad|> Poor cat got his ass kicked by a crab, rope and broom."
<|emo_disgust|> Its a bit weird of them to recommend you a song by The Strokes after they told you their offer
"<|emo_anger|> But once it's born, if its parents can't afford food, shelter and medical care, it can go fuck itself."
<|emo_anger|> It's a shame you're sticking up for a dictator who orders the beating and shooting of protesters in the street.
<|emo_disgust|> don't you get it? It's freedom to kill children now...
<|emo_joy|> *she. And I was was referring to the 2 goals in the final 6 seconds last year. Also vs Anaheim lol
<|emo_anger|> PayPal is fucking pricey. 500 bucks to Mexico cost me 60$
<|emo_joy|> Omg I thought you were paraphrasing. I'm so happy that those were the exact words they said.
<|emo_anger|> Your belief is literally killing children
<|emo_disgust|> hay guyz let's all hang around in a chat room about old pictures and masturbate in a circle with smug looks on our carb bloated faces
<|emo_joy|> Please provide some receipts! I believe you and can totally see this happening!
<|emo_anger|> This is a toxic behaviour.. get rid of him as soon as possible.
<|emo_joy|> Glad we agree.
<|emo_sad|> He was shrieking at everything up until then. Like I said I was worried in the beginning but sometimes it works out.
<|emo_fear|> Omg why does this sound like [NAME]?
"<|emo_sad|> Since I was a kid I knew I preferred funny, smart, interesting girls to conventionally attractive ones. Really tore me up the feeling wasn't mutual."
<|emo_joy|> Binged through this last night. Interesting and entertaining. I'd love to see more.
<|emo_anger|> Fuck you bro
<|emo_disgust|> That’s beyond disgusting in every way.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh shit. Is back?! Time to import
<|emo_anger|> Same pigs who bombed a mosque full of kids learning Quran. In Shaa'Allah those terrorists will burn in hell
"<|emo_disgust|> oh, ive seen that, ugh breeders have such weird and confusing minds"
"<|emo_fear|> Threaten to release....welp , nothing coming from this."
<|emo_sad|> Aw bummer. She lost her screenshot of the copy of a copy of bullshit articles handwritten in 1992. Somebody help a girl out.
<|emo_fear|> True enough. I'd love more LGBT friendly horror.
<|emo_joy|> I always wanted to be an actor! Always found it fun to emulate and/or imitate others
<|emo_disgust|> I watch his YouTube stuff. It's gross!
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME] is so cute ^_^, the second bunny image is my favourite. Since you haven't got any requests... I request Himiko."
<|emo_surprise|> This is surprising as many pizza places us peanut oil on the crust in the past. Had a friend end up in the hospital from this.
"<|emo_disgust|> ******fucking internet, am I right?"
<|emo_disgust|> How dare you put x on the same level as [NAME] and [NAME] [NAME] that's disgusting
<|emo_surprise|> What?! They must have thought they were at Disney.
<|emo_fear|> Bonus: her infamous bizarre introduction video. Truly frightening
<|emo_joy|> Wow so glad [NAME] is getting it done quicker. Better for later in tourney
<|emo_fear|> It's riskier to take on bad contracts right now
"<|emo_joy|> Finally some good vibes in this sub, im happy for you man!!"
<|emo_sad|> I’m so sorry 🤪
<|emo_fear|> Cries in Shinboner Spirit
"<|emo_joy|> Jeter been enjoying the Miami nightlife a little too much maybe, dulled his senses. "
"<|emo_surprise|> What the fuck? Really? That’s horrible. That’s probably illegal. If it isn’t, it should be."
<|emo_fear|> This is terrifying
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] could be so valuable if we didnt rely on him to create
"<|emo_surprise|> > I'm clearly not even a student I guess you've never heard of ""you"" being used as a general address."
"<|emo_disgust|> Almost like [NAME] culture is written to be offensive, what with the institutionalized rape slaves and everything. They might even be the baddies."
<|emo_anger|> We always look so hot headed at road 😞
<|emo_anger|> I had a GB in 1999 and it was worse than birthing my son. I would have loved to have had the sleeve....
<|emo_disgust|> I had a GB in 1999 and it was worse than birthing my son. I would have loved to have had the sleeve....
<|emo_surprise|> That as absolutely insane.
<|emo_anger|> *I curse you to an eternity of walking barefoot on a world of Lego!*
<|emo_disgust|> All I'm seeing here is that you commited a brutal murder.
<|emo_disgust|> The Broadway store was popular too. I get that it's regulated now but it's a shame.
<|emo_anger|> Can a lad please send me one of whatever the fuck this is plz.
<|emo_surprise|> I took Hawaii ML and even I'm clenching.... this is INSANE
<|emo_surprise|> I wondered what'd happen if I was away for too long from camp. So cool this happens
"<|emo_joy|> This is a real funny joke, [NAME]."
"<|emo_anger|> I hope she lives to be 200, just to piss them off."
<|emo_sad|> Otherwise it would be a terrible disservice to the NHL
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] will probably get something as worse as [NAME] in ep4
<|emo_joy|> I teased him about being an off center unicorn lol
"<|emo_disgust|> Sorry, spelling [NAME] Smearing* Motherfukers* "
"<|emo_disgust|> Any agreement we will come to will be exploitive because of the power differential, apparently."
<|emo_anger|> This is why I have trust issues
<|emo_joy|> I haven't heard that name in SO LONG. They had this GBA game that was one of my favorite games of all time!
<|emo_joy|> Wow 40 years at 18 wow how unfortunate.
<|emo_anger|> You leave [NAME] the fuck alone.
<|emo_joy|> Did you noticed they removed my post? Yep.
<|emo_joy|> Prepare for it and become happy with yourself but also accept its impermanence.
<|emo_anger|> ALL THE TIME
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] was the same in Crestwood. Scary as hell.
"<|emo_sad|> College is a very lonely place. Very stressful, very lonely. [NAME]. Good luck out there man."
"<|emo_anger|> I apologise for coming off as rude, the end comment was unnecessary and needlessly rude"
<|emo_joy|> Glad we cleared this up
<|emo_surprise|> Yeah keep filming your kid kicking a dog in the face. I'm suprised this isn't on r/funny
<|emo_disgust|> What a weird character to use for something like this
<|emo_anger|> wtf i hate [NAME] now
<|emo_anger|> That edge just got fire polished.
"<|emo_disgust|> Crazy how you could interchange ""husband"" with ""child"" and it would work the same. Ugh. "
<|emo_anger|> Fcuk you.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh a cat !
<|emo_joy|> Reminds me of when we used to have an RB named [NAME] while [NAME] was at Texas
"<|emo_anger|> If you can spend more time insulting me than insulting my ideas, then someone else here is dumb."
<|emo_joy|> Me too. Sweet!
<|emo_disgust|> Hated the work or the city?
<|emo_joy|> I’m also glad I’m not the only one that swears a lot at the bastard objects.
<|emo_disgust|> Don't do #4 it's bullshit
"<|emo_sad|> The sad thing is, relatively speaking these are actually pretty good living conditions. Check out Harris Ranch."
<|emo_anger|> Seriously?
<|emo_joy|> Cheers! *clink*
<|emo_joy|> This maybe my favorite thing I've ever seen on this subreddit. I took a screenshot and I'm sending it to husband. OP thanks for the laugh
<|emo_disgust|> He’s not the brilliant tactician he’s made out to be.
<|emo_surprise|> Completely miss-wired! I never thought a kid can grow up miss-wired.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh certainly this winter has been mild. It just started taking a dump on us the last week or so
<|emo_joy|> This is awesome! do you have any more artwork on a website or social site? Is this for sale!?
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] still got a little pop tho for calling for the match. Makes me smile that the crowd still loves her.
<|emo_joy|> Love the view. I would love to drink rum with a view like that. Have fun!
<|emo_sad|> Makes me sad I'll never be with a beautiful woman.
<|emo_disgust|> So you'll bleed and be in pain twice that day.
<|emo_anger|> What a totally innocent and integral part of our society! So glad our tax money can keep him company over his year long holiday!
"<|emo_joy|> I've actually been teaching myself R lately for this exact purpose, I'm super excited to check out your book when you're done with it. "
<|emo_sad|> I am so sorry that happened to you.
<|emo_sad|> After the first sentence you were my best friend. Then came the second sentence and now I really don’t like you.
<|emo_joy|> Yep.... Have fun
<|emo_fear|> Of course he will lie cheat and steal to make him self relevant to the public. Horrible person.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. Didn’t realize it was that broad.
<|emo_anger|> Gawd but [NAME] is a bitch.
<|emo_joy|> Huh I guess hes gotten calls to help someone bury stuff
<|emo_disgust|> This man makes aggressive grunts while breathing
<|emo_sad|> I'm missing something
<|emo_sad|> I hate my life
"<|emo_disgust|> Just because you lack critical thinking and reading skills doesnt mean i am a moron, it means you need to learn how to think for yourself."
<|emo_sad|> They've all fucked your mother. Just ask them.
<|emo_joy|> He will rest easy knowing how happy he made all of us
<|emo_joy|> Glad someone brought that up.
"<|emo_disgust|> Because bullying is a way to enforce social conformity, and discourage people from being different. "
<|emo_disgust|> You are so ugly even tears wont show up near you
"<|emo_joy|> Already did that, but looks like it's the end anyway. Cheers for the advice "
<|emo_disgust|> These are the guys who eventually shoot up banks and hide 13 year olds under their beds.
"<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing about this is, there is a good joke hiding deep down somewhere. Someone just used a jackhammer to retrieve it"
<|emo_sad|> I agree with everything you said. I still fell sad for her but this is the consequences of her own choices
"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, 16 yearolds being attracted to other 16 yearolds sure is creepy... "
<|emo_joy|> He’s one gorgeous and clever little man! Congrats on the new baby too!!!!
<|emo_sad|> This is so sad. #playdespacito
<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised [NAME] hasn't had a chance to be called up
<|emo_surprise|> I am surprised Facebook can't detect a non mobile device and redirect to the normal page.
<|emo_anger|> Some idiot talks shit to one woman - > SOCIETY shames WOMEN for BEING ALIVE
<|emo_joy|> I know this is a joke but people on this sub actually think this way lol.
<|emo_sad|> I'm just really sad all that cake was wasted.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow what a final quarter. [NAME] throwing two intersepts. What a dog
<|emo_sad|> Sorry man [NAME] doesnt care about hard working [NAME]. Sad
"<|emo_anger|> was i replying to you, you fucking degenerate? off yourself ( in game ofc )"
<|emo_anger|> That’s rude af. Slay him with your words. Give him every insult in the book then say bye bye
<|emo_surprise|> Crazy how [NAME] being a POS had been factual since the 90s but he’s only now feeling the consequences of his actions
<|emo_sad|> They are angry virgin children because he plays the game like it was supposed to be played. SOT has the most pathetic community ever.
<|emo_anger|> Hows it smell down there 9 points below the wild card spot. Ya fuckin pine cone
<|emo_anger|> ITS MAM!
<|emo_anger|> Every Saturday for the foreseeable future will be spent studying for the LSAT. Fuck
"<|emo_anger|> As ~~a very attractive person~~ an animal lover Monkey Heart sounds kind of cute to me, too bad these racist people use it as an insult"
<|emo_joy|> Oh yeah that
<|emo_sad|> Everyone is a little toxic inside. I feel like killers being toxic comes from survivors being toxic and vice versa. It's a vicious cycle.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh she opens her gullet like a freaking pelican!!!
<|emo_sad|> I turned the news on around 6 this morning and have never been so happy to have a commute of 4 miles to my job
<|emo_disgust|> That is awful. :(
<|emo_fear|> What a weird and slightly creepy thing to come to mind as a reaction to this video. /s Edit: apparently indicating my sarcasm was necessary here.
<|emo_anger|> I didn't say it would be impossible to assemble a computer. I said you wouldn't have one because they'd be too scarce and bloody expensive.
<|emo_joy|> Best I've ever had came out of a Disney cookbook my daughter brought home from
<|emo_joy|> So happy for [NAME]. So sad he's not here. Imagine this team with [NAME] instead of [NAME]. Ugh.
<|emo_joy|> True. I just always enjoyed the atmosphere of that place. And a couple of the sandwiches weren't bad at all.
<|emo_fear|> I always feel high the day after I smoke than after a day or two I feel fine u should be ok
<|emo_joy|> Also Strike Anywhere. This thread makes my heart happy. <3
<|emo_joy|> Imagine making a homophobic joke when your name is /u/Lebronlover23 OOF.
"<|emo_anger|> Serious question, where was this? That looks like my ex in the green top."
<|emo_surprise|> I'm so surprised they haven't done it yet tbh!
<|emo_disgust|> I'm climbing the walls right now. Just let me out of the house.
"<|emo_anger|> The state should kill them yes, you seem to have a very low IQ and can’t grasp [RELIGION]. No wonder you took up Reddit Atheism"
<|emo_surprise|> didn’t know [NAME] was still alive
"<|emo_disgust|> Ahhh, the old ""if you don't vote the way I do, you're a big dumb idiot"" gambit. "
<|emo_joy|> I absolutely love it that EVERYONE is scoring... please keep this up for the rest of the season.
"<|emo_sad|> Agree. Keep trying, then if your rejected every time. I'm sorry your done."
"<|emo_disgust|> Bohemian Rhapsody is a horrible song. Really horrible. Queen had a lot of great songs, but that one wasn't one of them."
<|emo_sad|> This hit way too close to home. I’m suing for emotional damage.
<|emo_sad|> Would love to if I wasn't sitting here writing a 40 page report for work.
"<|emo_anger|> Ah, modern society's obsession with romance for the sake of romance… I hate it."
"<|emo_joy|> No i know, was pointing it out for humor, not for any sort of accusation"
"<|emo_disgust|> this would be insane on your heart dude, but life’s short and people have done worse."
<|emo_joy|> I bet you’re really fun at parties.
<|emo_disgust|> Getting fired would make me leave im sure.
<|emo_anger|> TSA agents are like tow truck drivers. Everyone hates them.
<|emo_anger|> Don't you know? We have to just shut up and put our heads down until they decide!
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, this is my trashy goals in life. This woman is living out my dreams."
"<|emo_joy|> > Books. Love them, have enough The library is your friend :)"
<|emo_anger|> It's extremely rude.
"<|emo_joy|> Thank you so much for the wonderful compliment, glad you enjoy it!"
"<|emo_anger|> ""They hated [NAME] because he told them the truth."""
<|emo_joy|> Am I the only one that wants to see your art?? I love calligraphy! You might have a client here!!
<|emo_surprise|> I actually listened to the entire joke... and I read the press release from the CHRT. How about you?
<|emo_anger|> it depends on the page you moron.
<|emo_anger|> Which means it isnt his fault? And the 4th? What the fuck was he supposed to do. stop blaming 1 player.
"<|emo_joy|> Poverty has taught me to be practically happy with being hungry, especially considering when you finally do eat you'll be in fucking heaven"
<|emo_anger|> > he might not have seen the truth by the time he had posted the video That's kinda the *whole fucking problem.* Fake Motherfucking News
<|emo_disgust|> Why are our trolls so boring :(
"<|emo_joy|> I LOVE [NAME]. I truly do. I will be happy to vote for her, but pointing out clear differences is not negative."
"<|emo_disgust|> Mental games. Take a (mental) shot everytime the teacher mispronounces a word,or messes up grammatically"
<|emo_sad|> That's a huge shame and says more about Sacks than it does anything else.
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad you liked it :D
"<|emo_anger|> Just get down their half, Ulster! Heart can't keep taking this"
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh my god, zero-calorie Gatorade is a thing ^(i don't care how many chemicals are in it if its zero-calorie)"
<|emo_joy|> Honestly- live your life as a person who can love what others hate- because that’s just a little more joy in your life versus their hate.
<|emo_anger|> He acted like such a jerk- why would you want to be friends with someone like that? I would never trust him again.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow I got a virus from just looking at this post
<|emo_joy|> I've isolated myself to the extent that i only focus my energy on myself/work.as lonely as it sounds its been such a breath of fresh air.
<|emo_disgust|> There is nothing more disgusting than those who put children in danger unless it is the people who allow them to do more harm.
<|emo_anger|> How dare you hate [NAME]
<|emo_fear|> Its natural to fear what is unknown. Especially when someone is trying to force you to open a sketchy box while probably grinning the whole time.
"<|emo_surprise|> Well, my upcoming adverts are going to be interesting!"
"<|emo_joy|> Very happy to hear that. I hope he keeps at it, and is open and honest with them."
<|emo_anger|> That’s Grandpa [NAME]. I stomp flaming bags with my boots
<|emo_sad|> The bears still suck. The bears still suck. They really really really really really suck. The bears.... still.... suck
<|emo_joy|> ahhhhh no how dare i have morals of course the most important thing is that my favorite football team has a better special teams coordinator

"<|emo_sad|> He once played the cop too but failed- **his only failed attempt.** *[NAME] a bitch, mayorape-boy!*"
<|emo_joy|> If you find it I'm definitely sending it to my sibling. There's a special love for the weird in my family
<|emo_surprise|> I never even knew there were bullies in school unit I was out of school and read about bullies in school.
<|emo_sad|> The worst part is the character in the image behind it is great and this just hurts to read in his voice.
<|emo_surprise|> okay I just checked and OMG IT's SO TRUE (mostly) I really am a [NAME] <3
"<|emo_sad|> I'm a doctor. The doctor examining him with severe back pain after an injury should test for sensibility, muscle strength, and reflexes at least."
<|emo_disgust|> And in the worst fashion possible.
<|emo_joy|> Sending you love ❤️
<|emo_disgust|> I just never felt like a boy. I hate my body and I just feel like I can't express myself for who I am.
"<|emo_sad|> I fear slowly losing myself, and my cognition over an illness far more than I fear dying from a random accident tbh. "
<|emo_anger|> No TV Party for you 👎
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] Almighty. This may be the most empathetic and compassionate reddit thread I've ever seen! Who ever said drunks were mean? Terrible stereotype.
<|emo_anger|> KUBIAK WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN US???
<|emo_anger|> All I'll say is when I can smell it walking down the street it makes me very jealous.
<|emo_surprise|> You'd be surprised how much control [NAME] has in your life. I've experienced it first hand. Mentally.
<|emo_sad|> Looks like you got it bad. How soon till you can get out on your own?
<|emo_fear|> I feel personally attacked by this salad
"<|emo_sad|> Lost my kid to the system, wanna see wha the wee lassie has tae say"
"<|emo_surprise|> How do we know you're not a Mossad agent? I mean, not right now but, what if you joined in the future? /s"
<|emo_joy|> That gives me flashbacks to when my mom used to record me crying because she thought it was funny. Ugh.
"<|emo_joy|> Come to Melbourne [NAME], my wife cooks a rest roast we would love you over for dinner"
<|emo_disgust|> “Little dumb” ugh how awful
<|emo_joy|> I like His And Hers Poker Podcast
<|emo_fear|> >[NAME] One of the most horrifying stories I've ever heard of: the mom should be in psychiatric care and the doctor thrown in jail IMO.
<|emo_fear|> Sheed... Ik but I still envy Horry
"<|emo_disgust|> Definitely on how they act. Although if you put deeper thought into it, calling a woman a girl is rooted in misogyny. But context matters."
<|emo_anger|> also a harsh NOOOO when disgusted
"<|emo_anger|> Dog thinking ""shit this guy is crazy, better get out"""
<|emo_surprise|> Southern Mexico tends to always get fucked in the ass as well
"<|emo_surprise|> It is honestly just garbage, I'm surprised they're allowed to be ads"
<|emo_fear|> This sent shivers down my spine
<|emo_joy|> Thank you. People always forget that The Happiest Days of Our Lives is essentially part of that song.
"<|emo_anger|> Depends how irrational your spouse is, and that's often compounded when minor children are involved."
"<|emo_anger|> What does that have to do with [NAME] having sex with a child, what's the point you're trying to make with that piece of information?"
"<|emo_joy|> This is a huge stretch, but I would enjoy seeing some tweets from her hubby about it..."
<|emo_surprise|> Hi ex-methodist from another one!
<|emo_anger|> Sometimes you gotta agree with the terrible Facebook memes.
<|emo_surprise|> I cannot believe how unbelievably well [NAME] is playing. It’s insane he hasn’t scored.
<|emo_sad|> It's sad that we have to think of it as a miracle and not a regular occurrence :/
<|emo_anger|> DONT BE NEEDY. TALK TO OTHER GIRLS.
<|emo_joy|> It’s all a show. Welcome to season one of tanking in the Windy City.
"<|emo_joy|> Oh wow- some truly have crazy different genetics. I’m glad you got her a friend, I’m sure it helps immensely. "
<|emo_joy|> Wow she sounds like fun
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. Yeah I’m very new, only about 8 hours gameplay"
"<|emo_disgust|> Those pearls are the worst, ugh."
<|emo_surprise|> Exactly. It was The fact that everything happened and ended so suddenly that left me speechless.
<|emo_joy|> This is the sweetest.
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah.. like 30ish BBs deep I don’t think about it twice, just re-jam and be a sad boy. But we are so fucking deep..."
"<|emo_sad|> I actually feel bad for your roommate, poor guy."
"<|emo_surprise|> So, [NAME] and [NAME] are over? Have to wonder why he thought marrying a 19 year old was the best thing to do!"
"<|emo_sad|> [RELIGION] is what produces these people, there are plenty of them and a beheading has even occured in the streets of LONDON."
<|emo_sad|> Yup. How sad is it to admit I'm jealous of the ravens run game and defense 😣
<|emo_surprise|> I'm thinking I'd be wondering how I got my hands on a time machine.
"<|emo_surprise|> At that point [NAME] was no longer a virgin! No seriously, ask [NAME]! "
<|emo_sad|> Wow 40 years at 18 wow how unfortunate.
<|emo_anger|> Right? I hear too many horror stories of people ordering online and not getting the copy on the release date. I would be so pissed.
<|emo_fear|> Kotaku never ceases to amaze me with the horrible decisions they make in posting stories that can ruin people's lives with no confirmation or validity.
"<|emo_anger|> Almost like [NAME] culture is written to be offensive, what with the institutionalized rape slaves and everything. They might even be the baddies."
<|emo_sad|> I should have known what awaits behind the oilymama hashtag and yet I searched. Now I’m sad.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh. I never heard that before.
<|emo_fear|> This is scary to know that you went through. People like this are one step away from coming home with a gun or knife.
<|emo_sad|> Yeah sorry about that I don't mean it.
"<|emo_joy|> For me, she looks happy and nervous as well to meet to her future husband´s family."
<|emo_anger|> >big dumb rodeo Them's fightin' words
<|emo_joy|> This is fantastic and I'm happy for her!
<|emo_joy|> Raise them early in the way of the Braves! Congratulations!
<|emo_joy|> I would be impressed if [NAME] ate 15% of his weight every day I wish I lived in a state where the contest was valid. Stupid NY
"<|emo_anger|> You're a freak, you dirty dog you."
<|emo_surprise|> Happy cake day !
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME] doesn’t use reddit, but I’ll bring it up with her. She might find some good support there. Cheers! "
"<|emo_anger|> I was thinking 1-2 in each eye might stop the threat, but if I'm being honest I'd be worried about the ensuing legal struggle..."
<|emo_sad|> The part where he carries her to the car had me howling! Poor guy was stumbling with the weight he obviously couldn’t handle
<|emo_disgust|> If I had that I’d stop working and travel full time. I do not understand the avarice of the wealthy. It makes no fucking sense.
<|emo_anger|> Weird. It always makes me horny.
<|emo_fear|> This is like the timeline from hell.
<|emo_sad|> I am so very sorry that you are dealing with all of this
<|emo_anger|> Allow me to describe the shock and awe I experienced seeing this: **Fuck no why u do this?**
<|emo_anger|> Until he leaves for the Lakers and we’re right back in the same spot in two years after not winning shit
<|emo_sad|> I was/am the same. I'm the one pushing forward with the divorce though. The feelings of loss and fear are overwhelming sometimes though.
<|emo_anger|> This is amazingly unsatisfying.
<|emo_joy|> My exam is over and my winter break starts now 🎉🎉💃 I've been waiting for this omg
"<|emo_disgust|> Exactly. I forget what the ""killed per year in a school shooting"" figure is but it's shockingly low."
"<|emo_joy|> Love the Cafe Zoetrope, such a charming place. Beautiful building too."
<|emo_disgust|> What about every series prior to that? [NAME] was awful vs the bucks [NAME] was awesome. What about the years before that?
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] this was hard to get through. Please crosspost to r/sadcringe
"<|emo_sad|> Emotions are temporary. That's why we have multiple different ones. If you were permanently happy, you'd never feel sadness or envy or anger again. "
<|emo_anger|> Those are female toes. Busted!
<|emo_surprise|> I accidentally found it while googling things about “not wanting to be [RELIGION]” and “feeling trapped in [RELIGION]” ect.
<|emo_anger|> Bitch right!
<|emo_surprise|> There is a startling lack of empathy in this thread.
"<|emo_disgust|> You know what they say, when everyone around you is and asshole, maybe it's you who is the asshole."
<|emo_sad|> Sure it's okay. Very sorry for your loss. Your dad's posts kept me coming back here when I was just a lurker. Much appreciation.
"<|emo_disgust|> Weird, Tuxedo Mask looks shorter and pudgier than I pictured him to be"
"<|emo_disgust|> I messed up by trying the sweetened tea. Maybe tea just isn't my thing? Either way, nice to have the choice be my own. [NAME]"
<|emo_sad|> But then you regret it because you realize you secretly liked the attention. Just bottom things.
"<|emo_disgust|> Seriously? That’s so frustrating. It was [NAME] time to go, some of these “fans” are disgusting."
"<|emo_sad|> Man I'm sad, he was my favorite [NAME] when he left ([NAME] heir apparent) and I was ecstatic when he returned"
<|emo_joy|> Hahaha this is gold

<|emo_anger|> He must really hate changing dies.
<|emo_fear|> This is a terrible tip. Please think before doing something like this.
<|emo_anger|> Don't you fucken do it
"<|emo_joy|> I'm on the receiving end of a breakup, and i'm not handling it well. So cheers from Germany!"
<|emo_joy|> You need to look in the mirror if you going to say that [NAME] is overrated yet want to trade him for scrubs like Dedmon
"<|emo_joy|> You must be ecstatic, I'm really happy for you."
<|emo_disgust|> Well that's disgusting
<|emo_surprise|> I thought you only get to be a wizard after you're 30yo and still virgin
<|emo_sad|> my soul has long been destroyed :( it’s over for us nosoulcels
<|emo_joy|> well.. didn't have it when I was a kids but I like it now when it's served as side dish at beer bars.
<|emo_surprise|> I think it's safe to say I've peaked. 16/25 on the second half wouldn't all that surprising but I probably whiffed on [NAME]
<|emo_sad|> Sadly that's probably the worst game I've ever seen [NAME] play.
<|emo_joy|> No one comes here it’s cool
<|emo_fear|> My soul twin must be [NAME] because I’m terrified of water!
<|emo_surprise|> Obviously lmao weird flex but ok
"<|emo_sad|> Because after the troubles, making a joke about religion in Northern Ireland goes down badly. "
<|emo_anger|> Shut up why do you even care about what people choose to do with their bodies lol move on and keep living your miserable and ignorant existence.
<|emo_disgust|> Not ok. They could have easily given them a drug test if they really wanted to know if they were on drugs. Disgusting.
<|emo_sad|> That logic leads to a very dark place if all you have are terrible people in your life.
<|emo_anger|> NIKE NIKE NIKE NIKE NIKE NIKE NIKE NIKE NIKE Those leggings lmao
<|emo_fear|> That ice is dangerously thin for such a hot take.
<|emo_joy|> We did it guys! We’re the real heroes!
<|emo_anger|> I hate [NAME] but this dude has already lied to Congress. How can you believe anything he says

<|emo_disgust|> Your driving makes me sick [NAME]
"<|emo_anger|> Like it was over wayyyyy too fast for a real one. Shit, the Taliban lasted for years, and ISIS is still a huge problem."
<|emo_fear|> I keep hearing [NAME] is a terrible hire.
"<|emo_joy|> I FFed it too and reading that comment, I am sooooooooo glad I did!"
<|emo_anger|> I don’t understand WHY the [NAME] are so stubborn on this issue. They’re just like the [NAME] on abortion. Damn the facts!
<|emo_fear|> Yeah but you're not anymore I'm afraid.
<|emo_anger|> They're mad
"<|emo_fear|> I wouldnt go that far, but paranoid schizophrenia can definitely do that to someone. Even mild social anxiety can also cause it, though"

<|emo_surprise|> When you find out your favorite goat is flirting with the neighbors goat ....
"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a turd, but I actually believe him here. I'd be stunned if he didn't have a bigger offer than what [NAME] reported."
"<|emo_anger|> Then they're the worst fascists of all time, because their critics have been extremely loud and public, while not being murdered."
<|emo_sad|> I'm sad for the bot. They only want a purpose
<|emo_fear|> I'm scared to do these cuz the S.A.G.E. told me I was a transvestite

<|emo_fear|> Trial by jury of my peers is honestly my worst fear

"<|emo_sad|> Sorry i was thinking of the word ""Plaintiff"""
"<|emo_fear|> I have seen this gif like once a week for a year, and I still cringe every time. "
"<|emo_joy|> It definitely took a lot of research to figure everything out for myself, but I’m glad I was able to help ya!"
"<|emo_disgust|> Genitals in general are just kinda creepy, fleshy bits."
<|emo_anger|> ...says the opioid addicted narcissist with multiple untreated physical and psychological ailments and is completely unable to work with anyone but his own clone.
<|emo_joy|> I remember I had 4 polygamy porters in salt lake city at the airport while waiting on my next flight. The looks that people gave me were priceless.
<|emo_anger|> Ugh...terrible.
<|emo_sad|> The left says there is a police brutality issue so their fix is to make it hard for non police to get and carry guns. 🤔

"<|emo_disgust|> Bidets are disgusting. In america, we use toilet paper because our plumbing systems can take it"

<|emo_disgust|> Fruit is byfar the worst of all flavors
<|emo_joy|> Funny. He said the same thing to me. I don’t even have a daughter.

<|emo_joy|> Glad that it’s centered.
<|emo_joy|> So happy for [NAME]. So sad he's not here. Imagine this team with [NAME] instead of [NAME]. Ugh.
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, this is the first I've heard of her aligning with those people. "
"<|emo_anger|> Agreed. If anyone was ""murdered by words"" it was all the posts, including the top posts that make [NAME] look like an idiot."
<|emo_joy|> Glad to hear it. You deserve your best life without that abuse and negativity.
<|emo_sad|> I miss the confetti cakes :(

"<|emo_disgust|> Weird question, have they tried his Kentucky office or where ever he goes when Congress isn't in session , maybe he fled the capital?"
<|emo_anger|> But the seriousness makes it funnier. YES HELLO 311? SOMEONE IS WRONG ON THE INTERNET.
<|emo_sad|> The guy that waived a future hall of famer. Hard to get away from that decision.
"<|emo_anger|> The wage, you Fucking troll. But you don't care do you? See your post history."
"<|emo_joy|> It will be carefully tailored to piss their parents off, which I will enjoy greatly :-)"
<|emo_anger|> Stupid sexy squidward
<|emo_surprise|> Wow.
<|emo_joy|> i’m so glad you’re doing good now! have a great new year and keep pushing on my guy!
"<|emo_disgust|> Probably the same thing the rest of us do, chuckle and ponder how it can get any worse 😂"
<|emo_disgust|> One of the more disgusting virtue signals I've seen
<|emo_anger|> Don't call this baby a jerk It just loves its humans too much
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if the insurance company would go after the gun range or just drop the homeowner because they obviously lived in an unsafe area.
<|emo_anger|> But we libertarians are incapable of blindly voting for a bad candidate based on party! /s
"<|emo_anger|> Yeah, I do. I'm just pretty sure that that will fuck my heart eventually. But I'll worry about that later."
"<|emo_fear|> That face just screams ""Come here little boy, I have a lollipop for you"""

<|emo_anger|> This post is another reason why I'll never go back to Heroes. The loot box RNG was so cruel to me
<|emo_anger|> When traffic is moving it is definitely not legal nor safer. I hate how dip shits like you spread false information on this [NAME] forsaken subject.
"<|emo_disgust|> That's weird to hear since in Hebrew ""Son of man""- Ben Adam, simply refers to humans in general."
<|emo_anger|> This is painfully fake
"<|emo_anger|> Really didn't like. I thought it was nasty and mean-spirited. ""[NAME]"" on ice it isn't."

<|emo_anger|> Yeah lazily typing a naughty word to some retard on the internet is a real indicator of being angry rofl
"<|emo_disgust|> I say I love you to friends of both sexes and there's never been any problem, tbh I'm bissexual tho, so it should be weird either way"
"<|emo_joy|> Think you're pretty funny, don't you, freak?"

<|emo_joy|> I love it. Probably my favorite game mode right now. Especially when playing with a buddy.
<|emo_disgust|> That's so creepy
"<|emo_disgust|> "" [NAME] has come down with a terrible sickness which caused him to deactivate his twitter account"" Jeez sicknesses these days get worse and worse. "

<|emo_anger|> [NAME] damn it

<|emo_sad|> I feel like if [NAME] is that bad you bring in a traffic cone before [NAME]

<|emo_joy|> I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who snorted at it!
<|emo_anger|> He already sucks. Let’s just nerf him some more.
<|emo_anger|> Indifferent before leaving. Indifferent after. Although hasidic [NAME] are fucking mental.
<|emo_disgust|> But still incorrect usage of that subreddit. Shame! Shame!
"<|emo_sad|> No biggie, dude, sorry I got all triggered, I just reeeally love [NAME] "
<|emo_anger|> You probably can. They're shit at hurling.
<|emo_sad|> Well the house is burnt out so there's not a lot happening with it expect probably insurance folks need to investigate the damage.
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah, and don't forget the unblockable attack spam storm..."
<|emo_surprise|> The miracle was just that. Because we all know the Vikings would fail the next game.
<|emo_anger|> You want forgiveness? Stop spamming.
"<|emo_disgust|> If you’re working out, juicy AF, and needing to pay for escorts you must be got damn ugly in the face. "

<|emo_joy|> that made me cry tears of sadness and joy at the same time.
"<|emo_joy|> Not really, I like staying at home. When I go out for food I'm in and out of the store as quickly as possible. "
<|emo_sad|> Some of them really seem to be embittered by their own paranoia.
"<|emo_sad|> This is the sad truth for the exact reason he mentioned, they want a short fix to avoid doing this type of hard work."
"<|emo_anger|> Thanks for sharing, it really sucks that people would do this. I barely slept last night because I was so frustrated with the situation."
<|emo_fear|> Fock I cant breathe.
"<|emo_anger|> Welp. That sucks. I always check left and right when crossing an intersection, getting T-boned is one of my biggest fears."
<|emo_sad|> me. i’m the problem. i don’t think anyone can help me anymore.
<|emo_anger|> I wish people like this would die in massive flaming wrecks
<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I didn’t realize that
"<|emo_fear|> indeed, but im worried that this matchup will end up as the biggest bait since years and rookie will crush him badly"
<|emo_joy|> Baby mama was a comedy about this- but with a much happier ending

"<|emo_anger|> Such a sad, angry person. Take a break from reddit and go take up cycling or something."
<|emo_anger|> You people are awful. Those are *Haggisus Australis*. They're a protected species!
"<|emo_anger|> That's absurd, people commit crimes blacked out on drugs/alcohol all the time. Also, they could just claim they don't remember it either way. "
<|emo_sad|> Eat too many whoppers and he'll be down with the sickness. Lma0 I'm sorry
"<|emo_anger|> Sounds racist, fetishistic, sexist, and objectifying."

<|emo_anger|> Nothin worse that doin the smooth criminal to be able to piss in the toilet

<|emo_anger|> The Netflix documentary about [NAME] absolutely sucks. Don't waste your time.
<|emo_sad|> I agree. She seemed to truly love [NAME] . [NAME] loves the life [NAME] provides fir him. It’s a sad situation.
<|emo_anger|> She's just fighting off the MoMo hate bandwagon
"<|emo_sad|> Not only does the overbooking hurt the customers financials and time, but violations like this one put lives in danger."

<|emo_joy|> I like it! I think the ideas of [NAME] can go a long way. I wish you the best of luck :)
<|emo_disgust|> Sticking his tongue out.... ugh
<|emo_anger|> You gotta be a fucking idiot to use a regualr wooden pallet for a bale. Blue or Red pallets only
"<|emo_anger|> >The Charisma Myth"" It's bullshit too."
"<|emo_joy|> To check if someone was home? Someone answers the door, he just plays dumb and asks for directions or something. "

<|emo_disgust|> The way colt talks in that weird calm voice is like a psychopath. I hate it. It’s so condescending and creepy.
"<|emo_sad|> Bruh, fake music was the fucking best, wish we could go back."
<|emo_anger|> No youre a cunt
<|emo_joy|> Congrats on becoming the owner of this cat! What a beautiful meow.
<|emo_disgust|> What a horseshit response
"<|emo_joy|> Traded me away, the bastard. Kidding aside, it's the annual r/hockey trade deadline game."
<|emo_sad|> You didn’t sell that stock did you? I am sorry i hope the company rebounds.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] I just noticed this too! I just rewatched it recently and noticed him just drinking some tea next to [NAME] and [NAME].
"<|emo_joy|> The only ""pro choice"" I like is pro choice of guns! Another LIBERAL trolled epic style"
<|emo_anger|> Please explain how this is stupid
<|emo_surprise|> Omg! Sounds like [NAME] was right about calling [NAME] a weirdo! That is so so odd!
<|emo_joy|> I'm happy I live in a country where machete attacks don't have to be a real concern.
<|emo_surprise|> *holy shit* I'm pretty sure the panther thought the same thing
<|emo_joy|> All of troomtroom videos on YouTube are this odd and unnecessary. Some even more so. And their thumbnails are interesting
<|emo_fear|> Oh [NAME] this is atrocious... I think I'm in love
"<|emo_anger|> You choose a bad time, no one is fessing up anything during an election."
<|emo_disgust|> Fuck yea!
<|emo_joy|> Already taken haha
<|emo_joy|> King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard and Beach House are my two favourite bands.
<|emo_joy|> The comeback starts now!!!
"<|emo_disgust|> It's not better or worse, just different. "
"<|emo_anger|> Because lost media presents a question with no answer. Humans are curious creatures, so presenting them with knowledge that cannot possibly be learned is extremely frustrating."
<|emo_sad|> someone please upload that [NAME] poster at the end
<|emo_surprise|> What a terrible list
"<|emo_surprise|> Yes, good for Destiny and Bungie, I wonder if they will return to Microsoft, remain independent or sign with another company."
<|emo_joy|> beautiful story arc. glad you decided to end it in my semi hometown of excelsior - really neat lil town.
<|emo_joy|> No we're getting Kinsler and be happy with it
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh yeah, I forgot about the mean one."
"<|emo_sad|> they sounds like autistic meltdowns triggered by an immense fear of vomiting, nothing much to do"
<|emo_joy|> Gotta get 'email all! Edit: stupid autocorrect
<|emo_joy|> Best news ever. Some quality futbol at last!
<|emo_fear|> The dryer sounds like a fire hazard to me.
<|emo_surprise|> This response is highly unexpected yet logical. I’m fixin to chew on it for a spell.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME].
"<|emo_anger|> The Right: ""Why won't the left let us rape, abuse and brainwash children without putting their liberal noses where they don't belong."""
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] was only OP when it came out. [NAME] was OP for so long. I'm still happy they finally did something to her.
<|emo_fear|> They'd probably just use it to buy up armies and navies for tyrants who oppress and reign with blood and horror or some shit.
"<|emo_fear|> As much as he's a bit of a nutter, he does keep his word as far as I can tell."
<|emo_anger|> You realize I hate trump right? You’re super annoying I’m not dealing with this
<|emo_joy|> Hey look It's a Bernout from Potomac! Lol
"<|emo_surprise|> If they even took one history class about the 70s, they'd realize that this whole list was somehow ridiculously wrong."
<|emo_fear|> I’d be afraid to get high after that yo
"<|emo_sad|> I was so hyped after the zach shot, I'm still crying "
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] damn it
"<|emo_fear|> Love [NAME], but he is really dumb when it comes to politics and economics."
"<|emo_sad|> I swear if he is drafted as a father son to Gold Coast, I wont be happy"
<|emo_sad|> I should've left after the first period ended. That was brutal.
<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit! No way in hell I'd get that close to DFW in a Cessna!
<|emo_joy|> Go spidey go!!
<|emo_joy|> I'm slightly ashamed to say I thought that was what the title implied too. Glad that's not the case
<|emo_surprise|> Wow are you saying political agitators will drum up a controlled crisis and disseminate the edited video through a foreign fake twitter account
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if this will ever appear on BotW. Since it's so straightforward there probably isn't much to talk about.
<|emo_anger|> This is cursed
<|emo_joy|> Happy Easter everyone!!
<|emo_disgust|> i dont give a flaming fart about averages. most people have no taste in comedy.
<|emo_sad|> It wasn't an intelligent comment to begin with why would I take it seriously? Though I guess those 28 people did.
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] has some perpetual depression. Nothing makes him happy. Unfortunately I just don't see him succeeding at Chelsea in the true sense.
<|emo_anger|> Any man who won’t fight for his kids isn’t worth your time.
<|emo_sad|> I got bit by a Pomeranian while doing a dash...
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh man, dream date right there. Zoo then sushi?? Yes please. "
<|emo_fear|> Oh god [NAME] has a fucking gun oh fuck
"<|emo_fear|> He's alright, Avatar, The Happening and After Earth were genuinely terrible films. "
"<|emo_anger|> Ugh I live in WA state and now I'm scared I'm going to get measles even though I'm vaccinated, I hate anti-vaxxers"
<|emo_anger|> Kindly shut your pie hole.
<|emo_sad|> That was your saddest shortest story yet
<|emo_disgust|> TYT is a gossip shitpost panel for race baiting idiots. By race baiting idiots.
"<|emo_disgust|> Such dumbass,I think I'm going to take my dog somewhere else"
<|emo_anger|> What a fuckin n
<|emo_sad|> These disgusting old hags are literally old school flesh-consuming ghouls. Like [NAME] or [NAME].
<|emo_fear|> Black people still get shot unarmed. Comparing suffering is stupid and pointless.
<|emo_joy|> Exactly my goals as well. Let's make it a great year.
<|emo_joy|> This is hilarious
<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I forgot [NAME] and [NAME]. I have not read it.. have a link?
<|emo_anger|> He also says something about waking up from a nap in his gameplay reveal calling it a “pain in my ass”
<|emo_joy|> Idk if I’m wrong but I think they gave her some piercings on her ear which are cool too
<|emo_disgust|> Did [NAME] mention the astroturf pitch after today's comfortable 3-0 win? He certainly made a big fuss about it after the loss at Rugby Park.
<|emo_disgust|> Pretty shit tbh with you
"<|emo_surprise|> Idk, he could claim the victim jumped in front of his truck. There's no one to deny his side of the story."
<|emo_anger|> Damn! Kids these days don’t give me much hope for the future. It’s supposed to be a flaming dr pepper 🤦🏻‍♀️
<|emo_surprise|> Tuck her in and give her a kiss on the forehead
"<|emo_joy|> good luck, little 3 year old"
<|emo_disgust|> Ignorance is the worst thing that can happen to someone
<|emo_sad|> I have never laugh cried so hard at a TV moment
<|emo_sad|> Maybe it meant sorry just wondering
<|emo_surprise|> Wait u went to a hooker? I thought it was a massage person that was attracted to you
<|emo_sad|> Rape kit test from six year old migrant girl revealed DNA from 30 men.
<|emo_surprise|> I've seen this multiple times and wonder what happened to her after this.
<|emo_sad|> He is sacrificing himself for our sins. [NAME] bless.
<|emo_sad|> “kindness and compassion” [NAME]
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] - I misspelt and can’t correct it now
<|emo_joy|> My chest tightened so quickly
<|emo_anger|> Fuck this guy
<|emo_sad|> Not really cringe. Just sad.
<|emo_joy|> Thanks - Glad I did not waste the money / gold
"<|emo_fear|> Yeah pretty much. People do change, but never ever do they change because someone else demands it from them."
"<|emo_surprise|> I know this was a common thing, but never knew that were so many creative names for it until I read this thread. "
<|emo_disgust|> *people’s ..this is awkward
<|emo_anger|> Fuck the cubs
<|emo_anger|> kill me. lifes meaningless bc of this
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, are you me? No one is a fan of season 1 but I definitely do this. There are little gems despite [NAME]."
<|emo_anger|> Drs hate him!
<|emo_sad|> See as sad as I am I can’t hate anyone here.
<|emo_disgust|> When it’s read this way it’s way more badass. The way people normally quote it just sounds stupid.
<|emo_anger|> And it’s not like he was a bad coach. We’ve been spoiled from all our great seasons.
"<|emo_sad|> FFS. I find very few things more upsetting than reading their vile, twisted thought processes. "
<|emo_anger|> Fuck that. Anyone who makes a career out of spreading bullshit to morons is worthless trash.
<|emo_surprise|> It is the recent patch most likely! This never happened previously.
<|emo_disgust|> I would of taken a shit in the woods real quick
<|emo_joy|> Hahahahahahaha give me a piece of that kit Kat bar
<|emo_disgust|> Weird but effective
"<|emo_disgust|> I think he's a lustful, gluttonous, greedy, lazy, wrathful, envious, and prideful man. "
<|emo_fear|> I've also heard that intriguing but also kinda scary
"<|emo_sad|> I'm kind of struggling tonight. Bored, lonely... man "
<|emo_joy|> I am so blessed to be a lesbian.
<|emo_anger|> i feel like slapping /s after everything sucks the fun out. it's not my fault people are autistic.... /s
<|emo_anger|> Well.... fuck
<|emo_anger|> What rights do men have that women don't in the west? Damn.
<|emo_anger|> I’ve had to remove fallen trees on snowy roads because the forest service is not working as much. Shits a little fucked.
<|emo_sad|> It's disgusting how good our teams have been both years until december happens. It's usually started by injuries too.
<|emo_anger|> STOP GETTING BEAT WHEN YOU HAVE THE ADVANTAGE!
<|emo_surprise|> Wow [NAME] is back I hope to see better pain defense when the second unit is out there.
<|emo_fear|> I keep hearing [NAME] is a terrible hire.
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]. Gave up in October and haven’t looked back. I can’t believe how easy I’ve found it.
<|emo_anger|> If state showed any competence they would sue on behalf of the residents.
<|emo_joy|> Im glad your out too! Im glad you found joy in camping =)
<|emo_anger|> Super dumb that people are downvoting you for asking a question in good faith.
"<|emo_sad|> I was so hyped after the zach shot, I'm still crying "
<|emo_anger|> I *want* to like R&M but people are making it really difficult
<|emo_sad|> My son brings *homework* from kindergarten. I feel betrayed.
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] feel bad for ye no one can take a joke
<|emo_disgust|> What the hell are you on about now? Those are some weird examples to go with your clarified opinion.
<|emo_joy|> my favourite depictions of [NAME] and the gang are the ones where [NAME] is stoic and sassy and [NAME] and [NAME] are super emotional goofballs
<|emo_joy|> I’m so glad I’m not the only one with this stuck in my head now!
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] is giving me the 2016 AO vibes... hope he doesn't get injured again
<|emo_surprise|> OK. That is really weird.
"<|emo_anger|> Eh, some people grow up, get tired of banging their heads and decide to start using them instead 😜"
"<|emo_sad|> A friend of mine is like that, and they seemed quiet upset when someone form middle school said hello after they hadn't talked for 13 years. "
"<|emo_fear|> Welcome to racial integration, where your civility standards are racist and you better shut up or else."
<|emo_sad|> The only one to really be sad about losing is [NAME] tbh
<|emo_anger|> One of 30 alt accounts that trolls our forum because he is having a temper tantrum and can't get his $100 out of Qcx right away.
<|emo_joy|> No problem! Happy to help :)
<|emo_surprise|> couldnt believe [NAME] got the rebound AND the three
<|emo_joy|> I'm really happy he and [NAME] are finding success
<|emo_sad|> I thought chiropractors were bad! Look as these medical doctors who were pushing opiates on their patients by the thousands!
<|emo_disgust|> oh god this is the worst
"<|emo_sad|> If you have schools in your city, I got bad news for ya champ..."
"<|emo_joy|> I knew you had kids, i didnt know they were old enough join the military lol. Well happy bday to your son, dad. "
"<|emo_anger|> But the battle dynamics are sh*t. Every other ME is better in that respect, especially the squad AI is bad. Really bad."
<|emo_disgust|> Wish you did more. Sounds like she deserved worse.
<|emo_surprise|> Dude couldn’t see he had a spool of hair growing on his face?!
<|emo_anger|> i curse you
<|emo_anger|> Why is it impossible? Can we not manage our own education and incentivise people into the fields we need them?
<|emo_anger|> Just get him out of my sight I’m tired of losing and those who contribute to it
"<|emo_anger|> Ha, who cares about them supporters...the most important thing for society is that justice is served and the man jailed! Scream all you want. "
<|emo_surprise|> Now I'm wondering on what I've been missing out. Again thank you for this.
<|emo_joy|> How could you ever get bored of place that is getting more and more enjoyable as you are there
"<|emo_sad|> I know, I know. I tend to have that effect on people "
<|emo_sad|> I'd keep taking it. The side effects should go away soon. Paxil has been the only med that helped me.
"<|emo_anger|> Made me so angry to read that, I almost downvoted your comment. Upvoted, for sure. Grr! "
<|emo_anger|> How dare you disrespect [NAME].
"<|emo_disgust|> If you are as ugly as you say you are, you're already a statistical outlier."
<|emo_surprise|> Wow that feels like discrimination against the poor [NAME] kind.
<|emo_anger|> I really despise that woman.
<|emo_anger|> Not sure why you are getting downvoted for this comment. I really dislikes the Facebook type posts on this sub.
<|emo_sad|> Yelling anger sorrow. Not that funny to me.
"<|emo_disgust|> Ouch, that looks horrible. Tagged his leg on the dumpster. Lucky he didn’t lose a leg going that fast."
<|emo_sad|> Every day it gets harder to tell the difference between a legit mental health issue and someone just using it as an excuse to be an arsehole.
<|emo_joy|> I switched to aram/special game modes only and it stays pretty fun.
<|emo_sad|> This sucks so much and I’m sorry. I hope you recover and have a wonderful life.
<|emo_sad|> Is this from “Please Like Me”? I loved that show. The last season had me in tears though. Really hard to watch. 😢
<|emo_disgust|> No thanks probably stank af.
"<|emo_joy|> Great story. Maybe it isn't malicious compliance, but I enjoyed it anyway. Damn companies who lack empathy for other humans."
"<|emo_anger|> then explain to me why everytime I post reply to u/955bsp, in an old post, you start spamming me"
<|emo_surprise|> Those damn tires
<|emo_anger|> People have always liked kinky sex. But this is just BAD kinky sex..
<|emo_disgust|> It's weird how quickly I agreed with you. Usually I'da been more incredulous.
<|emo_sad|> I just get sad when I see people commenting on articles and videos about him that they think he's on drugs.
<|emo_sad|> The sad part is that we are not trying to tank
<|emo_sad|> That is insanity
"<|emo_anger|> Fuck it, maybe the faceless men worship the great other AND assassinated the fire warlocks in valyria, hwo knows?"
<|emo_anger|> This is my fiancé and I hate it
<|emo_sad|> Had such a hard time cutting up the steak
"<|emo_fear|> Because it's scary, and therefore thrilling to face your fear. Also the shrimp are easier to catch at night."
"<|emo_sad|> sorry fam, but this is a repost on this sub as well."
<|emo_anger|> This sub is becoming a “Gamers rise up” parody of itself. This is ridiculous.
<|emo_disgust|> Yes it is child abuse. It’s sexist too.
"<|emo_joy|> Play the lottery my dude, you just got lucky."
<|emo_anger|> How are they assholes?
<|emo_sad|> >!This really crushed my soul!<
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah [NAME] is a pretty weird guy.
<|emo_anger|> She got the death penalty...? fck me.
<|emo_anger|> Because this creep wanted to put his hands on the girl.
"<|emo_joy|> Hell, I'm saving your Reply. Enjoy being the first in my list!"
<|emo_anger|> Full time tennis fans are pompous and annoying.
<|emo_anger|> Cut the guy off and gave him a yes-no question. Which he exasperatedly answered. This is not the way to listen.
<|emo_sad|> I perform nostril waxing. It is surprising hardly painful at all. Feels so much better too!
"<|emo_anger|> That might be intentional? Not sure, I don't use it."
<|emo_joy|> General malaise is a favourite. I get a lot of general malaise.
"<|emo_sad|> Usually they ask, and the generic is almost always cheaper. It's shitty of them not to ask though. "
<|emo_disgust|> Literally nothing. Every single thing on my body is ugly. I'm not exaggerating or imagining things.
<|emo_fear|> Are you afraid of [NAME]?
<|emo_disgust|> i once dipped a raw hot dog in chocolate pudding when i was dared too. it was dreadful.
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] is super happy. Nice.
<|emo_sad|> Now there is no one face to face so tough is an option
<|emo_surprise|> And it would be totally yawnworthy the 2nd time round. The shock value has gone forever. You can only do that once.
<|emo_fear|> Omg I just finished and I'm in awe...
"<|emo_sad|> If you think NOED is OP, use small game, if small game is bad, your argument is invalid. "
"<|emo_sad|> I, also, wound up face down on my floor for a good 5-10 minutes after the Saints won it in OT. "
<|emo_anger|> I wanted to bring to others' awareness here to the site and its absurd name. I've removed the link now above.
<|emo_disgust|> Disgusting amount of oil.
<|emo_anger|> I would hate to see another [NAME] situation where [NAME] gets hurt again because he wasn't fully recovered.
<|emo_anger|> Fucking hate [NAME]..
<|emo_fear|> I did the same thing in school. Thank [NAME] for the library. Are you anxious about how your brother and sister would react to that?
<|emo_joy|> Congrats to you!! So happy for you! wow socks is sooo nice!
<|emo_disgust|> 2 or 1 seed we’re still playing a bad team in the first round
<|emo_anger|> So you then took that lie and began aggressively cheating on him? Your post history. Wow.
<|emo_joy|> Hello! Happy new years my friend!
"<|emo_anger|> Well, the [NAME] should help us out, the reason we are in this political mess is because we detained a person for them. "
<|emo_sad|> I’ve left my friends back at home. I know no one in this state.
"<|emo_disgust|> Ugh, man, I really liked Louis CK. Not anymore. I still like Brand New even though [NAME] is a creeper."
"<|emo_joy|> enjoy that vodka, [NAME]"
"<|emo_joy|> If you feel like venting, I am happy to listen."
<|emo_joy|> Made my day
<|emo_fear|> for a moment i got scared and wondered what was this doing here then i read the happy ending
"<|emo_sad|> We had the chance, but never made the offer last year."
<|emo_joy|> Haha the death and suffering here! Haha he had kids! Haha he was a philanthropist! Haha you might be a sociopath.
<|emo_anger|> How the fuck do you moan tho
<|emo_sad|> Our road still hasn’t been salted on Troy Hill
"<|emo_joy|> I just got banned from one of his subreddits, I haven't been this excited for a ban since the snap from /r/thanosdidnothingwrong!"
<|emo_surprise|> Omg its hannibal cooper
<|emo_joy|> I scrolled past this and thought this was a title reveal and got so excited. Good GOOD theory though!
"<|emo_anger|> You did nothing wrong. I really encourage you to look into emotional abuse and manipulation, as it sounds like you're on the receiving end."
"<|emo_surprise|> ha, hardly. maybe the biggest city. Russia is fucking huge."
<|emo_joy|> Glad to hear it :) definitely more on the way!
<|emo_joy|> It always makes me super happy when I see stuff like this. Go live your best life girl!
<|emo_joy|> Her absence is probably the greatest present she can give you. Enjoy it while you can.
"<|emo_disgust|> Weird flex, but ok"
<|emo_joy|> This makes me smile!
"<|emo_sad|> So sorry, for your loss."
<|emo_surprise|> What's there to dislike?
<|emo_fear|> Shock collars are horrible. They poor pup. 😫
<|emo_joy|> Good news. Makes me feel BCH is way underpriced and has a huge upside.
<|emo_surprise|> So that's how people get their cars sideways in those crazy pictures. I'd always wondered.
<|emo_anger|> And I’ll admit I am insane for allowing it to happen but the passion I have for this guy makes it hard to cut off all contact.
<|emo_sad|> It's seriously terrifying!
"<|emo_joy|> The double fist bump made me smile, her happiness was contagious"
"<|emo_fear|> Never made it through, it makes me physically ill just seeing images of that monster combined with him describing his incomprehensible evil."
<|emo_anger|> Yes what the fuck is going on here
"<|emo_fear|> errrrrrrrrr that's pointless, and your Doctor I'm afraid is pointless as well."
<|emo_anger|> Damn why you gotta do my man [NAME] like that?
<|emo_surprise|> Absolutely no one was surprised at her choice to run in 2016...
"<|emo_sad|> Living here. Now my daughters biggest aspiration is to leave this place, and I can’t say I blame her. "
<|emo_disgust|> Ah fuck.
<|emo_anger|> GET MORE GOALS FUCK [NAME]
"<|emo_surprise|> I'll admit that's a bit surprising, since it's such a massive international hub. But beggars can't be choosers I guess. "
"<|emo_joy|> Why didn’t she celebrate, she redirected that one in!!"
"<|emo_anger|> Fuck all those ""racist [NAME] supporters,"" amirite"
<|emo_anger|> what in the actual fuck. why are they still driving?!?!??!!?! Love the kindness of the young dudes tho
<|emo_disgust|> Ugghhh... we deserve better than to resign ourselves to the fact that the best 3B we can get or even strive for is the Cubs third stringer.
"<|emo_sad|> Gave ya an upvote but sadly, by reading this thread its not going to help"
<|emo_disgust|> Technology bad!
<|emo_disgust|> Oh good point! I bet the farthest they go is reporting to credit agencies. Which still sucks but he can always fight that outside of court.
<|emo_fear|> Yeah some kid in a BMW ran me off the road. I didnt just crash had some help.
<|emo_anger|> Damn... METOO
<|emo_joy|> Ye. And I can put it on another scumbag i know
<|emo_anger|> Get [NAME] back on the wing. Looks awful in this position
"<|emo_anger|> Seriously. ""Haha british people pronounce something funny"" ""Yeah well your children are murdered in violent attacks and your healthcare system puts millions in crippling debt"" "
<|emo_sad|> I really felt for this mother. You could tell how frustrated and exasperated she was. Glad she was there to stand up for her kids.
<|emo_sad|> Like my Mom and Aunt on the first day of 7th grade. I feel for you dog.
<|emo_joy|> 3h late comment. have fun at school !
"<|emo_sad|> d'oh, my bad 😔"
<|emo_surprise|> You've had sepsis 3 times? Shit. I'm 27 and I don't recall every having a single infection
"<|emo_disgust|> 1, you,, you,, actually shat on a hamster? 2. Washing your hamster can kill it 3. You fucking shat on your hamster"
<|emo_joy|> Hi [NAME] nice to see you
"<|emo_sad|> Butter bronzer-physicians formula and I HATE the smell. I haven’t really played w it but wow, so scented."
<|emo_sad|> Feel you pain. Stay strong
"<|emo_disgust|> ahah I hadn't even thought of it until the scenario I mentioned above, so dont feel too bad."
<|emo_anger|> Can you stop living with this person? Engaging in it will only make it more toxic
<|emo_anger|> He was in the merge lane and should have yielded. He was legally in the wrong.
<|emo_anger|> What the fuck is that horrifying picture
<|emo_surprise|> I think it should be a felony. Kind of crazy that illegally entering a country is such a minimal offense.
<|emo_surprise|> And you've never driven over the speed limit?
"<|emo_disgust|> You can get trough it, it sounds like fucking bullshit, but you can"
<|emo_disgust|> She refuses them by inhaling them [I'm sorry if that sounded bad plz no downvite]
"<|emo_anger|> WHEN I DO BEGIN TO PEAK, ALL OF [NAME] WILL KNOW!"
<|emo_sad|> OH NO NO NO NO
"<|emo_joy|> I LOVE IT, I would love if they will make season 2... I really enjoyed it"
<|emo_anger|> Ah yes three of my ~~best friends~~ worst enemies
<|emo_surprise|> Get a ride to heaven. You think [NAME] wants to pedal that far!
<|emo_sad|> Oh man is this true. Coffee has a seriously negative effect on some people! I'm 39 and just figured it out this year
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that really hurts coming from a demented troll sockpuppets brigading me on this sub"
<|emo_sad|> So you'll bleed and be in pain twice that day.
"<|emo_joy|> Music and getting outside really helps me, even if I’m not sober. Cheers."
<|emo_joy|> Ah haven't heard of them before. [NAME] is from Fourig which is right outside Dayton. Congrats on your new addition! <3
<|emo_joy|> > since every character with a shield gets one Except Glad
<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. That sucks to hear about [NAME]. I guess not uncommon with a bad family life.
<|emo_anger|> That's probably percisely what they did... They couldn't get into the server still. I'm sure they have specific rules about delaying and pausing.
"<|emo_sad|> oops, my bad."
<|emo_disgust|> Doctor charged 400 bucks for a blood pressure check before renewing my wife's high BP medication. She HAS been acting a little weird la
<|emo_joy|> I love it. The only thing faker than their lies is them. I’m glad the girl was able to get her divorce.
<|emo_joy|> I would normally give them the benefit of the doubt but they've really damned themselves today. Their hypocrisy is incredible.
<|emo_surprise|> I’m wondering about those friends of hers that encouraged her to contact you..
<|emo_joy|> Glad to see that thoughtful doggo found a home here!
<|emo_surprise|> I think most of these pictures would be much scarier if we had the perspective of the guy
"<|emo_sad|> My bad. Was half asleep while typing and couldn’t remember how to spell😂 I just let autocorrect take over, thanks! Lol"
<|emo_sad|> I miss the [NAME] and [NAME] love story.
<|emo_disgust|> This article is stupid.
"<|emo_fear|> Bohemian Rhapsody is a horrible song. Really horrible. Queen had a lot of great songs, but that one wasn't one of them."
<|emo_sad|> >Pretty much as soon as he said he was going to work towards income equality he was killed. It wasnt for his civil rights work.
"<|emo_disgust|> I just rewatched season 5. My god, I had forgotten how horrible [NAME] is. "
"<|emo_sad|> Thank fuck they died... I mean rip, so sad 💭🙏"
"<|emo_sad|> Ive gone through very similar things...i completely understand. Praying wont do much, seek a therapist to talk about things"
<|emo_fear|> Welcome home [NAME]!
<|emo_anger|> I'm honestly so pissed off for you. That whole situation is insane. Good luck moving on. No one deserves to be treated like that.
<|emo_sad|> why fire make hand hurt
<|emo_disgust|> it depends who i would murder and blame
<|emo_fear|> Pretty wild.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] I HATE those.
<|emo_sad|> I'm so so so sorry this happened to you friend. I hope [NAME] had a lovely life 💗
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah, that would be one value combo he would shove that she is beating."
"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, she told me about some creepy guy who came by asking about me and licking his lips."
<|emo_joy|> Glad you're at least out of bed. Progress!
"<|emo_sad|> this would be insane on your heart dude, but life’s short and people have done worse."
<|emo_fear|> Bless this woman. That honestly sounds horrific from every end. I hope her ex [NAME] has lived a horrendous life since perpetuating that disgusting act.
<|emo_fear|> FEAR THE TURTLE
<|emo_sad|> Sadly I know lots of peeps that would find this dude hot. He has that LA 90’s Persian chic thing going for him
"<|emo_fear|> I know, and the unfortunate thing is many of my friends in this area have had somewhat similar experiences with dudes who just are just total creeps. "
<|emo_disgust|> > She fucked my bumper up and I will forever hate her And her insurance didn't repair it because???
<|emo_fear|> >[NAME] One of the most horrifying stories I've ever heard of: the mom should be in psychiatric care and the doctor thrown in jail IMO.
<|emo_disgust|> We cant even get sexually assaulted without them claiming we're gross fetishists
<|emo_anger|> Fuck calm down [NAME]
"<|emo_anger|> Mental games. Take a (mental) shot everytime the teacher mispronounces a word,or messes up grammatically"
<|emo_anger|> I cannot believe the fucking audacity of him. Have some shame for [NAME] sake.
<|emo_anger|> BITCOIN SEND MONEY INSTANTLY (waits 6 months to get money and still praises site)
<|emo_anger|> Fuck your opinion apparently
<|emo_fear|> Reminds me of [NAME] from the documentary THIN who purged food through a feeding tube in her stomach. This sounds dangerous.
<|emo_sad|> I am now weirdly aroused
"<|emo_anger|> YOU WRITE LIKE A YOUNGER MAN, WITH NOTHING HELD BACK. ADMIRABLE, YET MISTAKEN."
"<|emo_sad|> What a loser, sad. "
"<|emo_joy|> My wife's birthday today, we are going for dinner with my lovely girlfriend later, after meeting at ours for coffee and cake. Very happy"
<|emo_disgust|> only take your shoes off if there is carpet. and carpet is nasty.
"<|emo_joy|> Tell him, that just as he has a very shy person and I told her just to get a pretty woman with a strapon."
<|emo_surprise|> I didn’t actually know that. I wish I was surprised.
"<|emo_surprise|> That's what I said! I'm like ""I wonder how he kept that much of the profits?!"""
<|emo_surprise|> I’m the most surprised that [NAME] is 35. Seems like just yesterday he was plotting with [NAME] on how to get booze for the party
<|emo_sad|> I rolled my eyes so hard I think I just saw my brain
<|emo_sad|> Her track record is pretty shaky
<|emo_anger|> The worst thing is when you find it in a place you know you looked first.
"<|emo_joy|> I’m up here too man, having a great time so far!"
<|emo_surprise|> That’s a wonderful meaningless word salad
<|emo_joy|> Mmmm that delicious karma :3
<|emo_anger|> same but with cats. Puppies are really high maintenance and make me angry when i have to take care of them.
<|emo_disgust|> He’s a grumpy boyo
"<|emo_anger|> I'm from Buenos Aires, and I say kill 'em all!"
"<|emo_joy|> I love the creative writing that stems from this sub, so entertaining."
<|emo_sad|> I would say they do because it was a horrible accident but they were also in the wrong. The military tried to get them to disperse they didnt.
"<|emo_sad|> Well the last sentence reallt hurts, but still I'll do my best to stay with her and keep her happy. I really love this girl"
"<|emo_joy|> Yeah, it'll be a pretty strong 3 team race among the Nats Braves & Phillies! It'll be fun to watch it from afar!"
<|emo_disgust|> Seeing [NAME] on Sunday and I'm so fucking stoked
<|emo_sad|> Being so rare and only giving you bad luck? Fake news
<|emo_anger|> I’m just shitposting dude. In the spirit of the thread “I was bored”
<|emo_anger|> Smh people aren’t seeing the real issue though. That’s the woman’s bathroom. ‍♂️
<|emo_surprise|> It's wonderful because it's awful. At not with.
"<|emo_anger|> ""I lost control"" would have been an understandable explanation. ""It lost control"" is not. "
<|emo_sad|> My heart is breaking for that little girl.
"<|emo_anger|> TIL the Recession, Great Depression, Colonialism, War on Drugs etc. were created by socialists. "
<|emo_joy|> say it with me now super star
<|emo_anger|> That's too many pills
"<|emo_surprise|> I see , they don’t sell phones any more"
<|emo_joy|> I bought milk and honey for its cover. ended up loving it anyway.
<|emo_joy|> i used to do this a lot when i was younger lmao glad to see my vision wasnt just mine
<|emo_anger|> You're a mean person.
<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck did I just read?
"<|emo_surprise|> Now I'm wondering if [NAME] drinks, and if he's ever been inebriated during one of his deals."
<|emo_surprise|> Is that [NAME]?
"<|emo_disgust|> No more [NAME] from Georgia. Suck it you old, ugly hag."
<|emo_sad|> I can’t translate /s to Texan speak well and forgot so my apologies y’all :)
"<|emo_anger|> Thanks, I hate it"
<|emo_disgust|> A-fucking-men! :)
"<|emo_fear|> Damn, that's dark"
<|emo_surprise|> Really? Thanks for the correction.
<|emo_anger|> they're shite - disgruntled OCSC fan
<|emo_sad|> What a beautiful memory for you to have found. So sorry for your loss ❤️
<|emo_joy|> Ha! I like the way they feel all over each other.
"<|emo_joy|> You had me at “unspeakable scientifical horrors”, lol!! You are my people, [NAME]. "
<|emo_fear|> Looks like wood. Could be wrong.
<|emo_surprise|> Yes but that's largely changed in much of the US (the coasts at least). Surprised a state or two hasn't legalized it
"<|emo_anger|> No, sex is a reward, and he doesn't deserve it."
"<|emo_sad|> oh that's cool, I didn't know they already got sick time. It'll help a lot with retail workers who get dicked by shit scheduling "
<|emo_joy|> Walking into Chick Fil A feels like walking into a church. No thanks. I will forever see them as a bigoted organization.
"<|emo_joy|> The possibilities are fascinating. In other times, I'd be enjoying watching the lawyers argue...!"
<|emo_anger|> WHY [NAME]?
<|emo_disgust|> Because they're having to compete and so we get exposed to the weakest of the bunch.
<|emo_fear|> I did this first try but then the next time I played I was ducking hollering
"<|emo_anger|> im not talking about a studio. im talking about *people*. people that you're lying about, because you're an uninformed yet arrogant, entitled child."
<|emo_anger|> What a fucking cunt
"<|emo_anger|> yep. Sucks don't it? You can't do anything about it now, and nobody cares. "
<|emo_anger|> Predatory towing is getting ridiculous. I have up to date stickers for all the properties I maintain and have been towed twice. Fuck em.
<|emo_disgust|> YIKES!!
"<|emo_anger|> Instant fucking turn off, ugh. Fuck us for wanting equality across the spectrum"
<|emo_joy|> What's the source? I love this.
"<|emo_joy|> this actually made me LOL, thanks"
<|emo_joy|> I think you're right. She has oodles of cash and young grandchildren to enjoy. Going through that hideous gauntlet again probably isn't that appealing.
<|emo_sad|> So Green Bay doesn't get him... I'd be sad for the kid.
"<|emo_anger|> It's a statistically slightly worse ICR, take that as you will."
<|emo_joy|> Well then I’d say you have a pretty good chance if it’s any girl lol
"<|emo_joy|> Intended as a ""it's funny because it's true"" not ""this is hilarious"""
<|emo_joy|> I wish I could retort with peep show memes about nazis and pints now. Haha! Cheers
<|emo_anger|> What the hell
<|emo_joy|> >a fun activity!!! At no point in my TBM life would I have found that fun or worthy of even one exclamation.
<|emo_joy|> What's even worse: the deciding voter refused to support the subway because he was strangely obsessed with a horse & buggy transit plan from 1858.
"<|emo_sad|> It’s all good man, I missed [NAME] too. I REALLY hope we get another dream sequence with him in EP4. "
"<|emo_fear|> Ouch, that looks horrible. Tagged his leg on the dumpster. Lucky he didn’t lose a leg going that fast."
"<|emo_disgust|> There has been the odd occasion without condoms. No deep penetration, but never the less. Some. I feel awful."
<|emo_joy|> If it was Central Transport you might of got lucky. Sometimes I wonder if they even hve doors on the trailers things go missing an awful lot
"<|emo_surprise|> You know, ive always wondered how a car could get in a position like that"
"<|emo_fear|> Whoa, should've said that in the post. Threats is not good. I'd find a way to live away from him asap. "
"<|emo_joy|> Something something don't fight what you hate, save what you love."
<|emo_disgust|> Crazy how [NAME] sheds more light on this than Blm. Shame
<|emo_joy|> Griefing your oponents is amazing fun in a pvp game. *Cheating* to grief is the problem being addressed here.
"<|emo_anger|> MeToo is about sharing personal stories of sexual assault. Reframing it as accusation based, and as furthering a kidnap, is fucking disgusting."
<|emo_anger|> ARGH!!
"<|emo_anger|> Preach in such a way that if people don't end up hating their sin, they end up hating you. -[NAME]"
"<|emo_anger|> “1, personal space. 2, I like my personal space. 3 get outa my personal space...”"
<|emo_anger|> Weird how he doesn't have to say the word review in order to spend the entire article reviewing
<|emo_fear|> That was a terrible pass regardless. Wasn’t close
"<|emo_surprise|> Omg yes. Could you imagine? Pepperoni rolls, peach schnapps in a mason jar and beer cheese at dinner parties. Love it"
"<|emo_surprise|> I never heard ridiculous right-wingers mocking people for being ""triggered"" until ridiculous liberals started referring to themselves being ""triggered""."
"<|emo_anger|> Dog thinking ""shit this guy is crazy, better get out"""
<|emo_fear|> I remember that! She crashed and they asked her to leave lol. That was one of my fav moments.
"<|emo_fear|> This is reddit, unfortunately it's entirely possible he isn't being sarcastic"
<|emo_joy|> Never had a girl out right tell me she likes me and i have been in 3 somewhat long relantionships.
"<|emo_sad|> Unfortunately, we live in 21st century America, where this kind of behavior ensures that they will both be given high-paying jobs at CNN."
"<|emo_anger|> Well, I **NEVER**! ""Lady, you really *should*."""
<|emo_anger|> A Wall is NOT a Volition of the NAP you idiot.
<|emo_joy|> Funny way to oppose fascism - since they are themselves fascists
<|emo_sad|> *losing hope Loose is what your mom is
<|emo_anger|> 1 month feels like 200 years? School must suck
"<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe people are saying [NAME] should have been saved, she knew like 10% of the words"
<|emo_disgust|> Eyebrow zits are the worst. I'd rather have a lip pimple than an eyebrow pimple. Also part of the fanclub for your eyes.
"<|emo_joy|> That sound you are hearing is me, a middle aged woman, applauding you wildly. How fun this is to read on my morning break."
<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid if I have a awful time or something like that I'm going to get worse..
<|emo_fear|> My biggest fear is catching feelings. I got dangerously close once lol. It’s just about self control.
<|emo_sad|> This is why I stopped watching. :( The brutality was disgusting.
<|emo_disgust|> Looked ugly.
"<|emo_joy|> ""drop the beat *AYYYYYYYYY........OOOOOOOOHHHHNNNOOOOOO""*"
<|emo_disgust|> Fuck
<|emo_sad|> sorry [NAME]! 😘😘😘
<|emo_sad|> I didn't find it too bad. I always favoured the 1500m and my wife is from Abu Dhabi
<|emo_anger|> I sliced my abs in half!
"<|emo_anger|> For serial rapists, its not about the physical pleasure. Its all head games. Damn freaks"
<|emo_anger|> What? Shut up?
"<|emo_anger|> Oh damn, it’s gonna hunt me down. "
<|emo_joy|> >Playing competitive MTG has brought me as much joy as my children. Yeah this conversation is over
<|emo_joy|> Thank you!!!!!
<|emo_joy|> What a finish
<|emo_anger|> I just never felt like a boy. I hate my body and I just feel like I can't express myself for who I am.
"<|emo_joy|> Haha yeah, apparently their ringleader just got banned on Twitter. "
<|emo_disgust|> Girls screaming alone gives me horrible flashbacks
"<|emo_anger|> Makeup existed in 2009 too. Whoever made this is stupid. I hate the whole ""milinials dumb"" shit."
"<|emo_joy|> Congrats, darling! That is a monumentally meaningful accomplishment. I'm both happy for and proud of you <3"
<|emo_surprise|> OMG she's BYEsexual. Sorry I had to.
<|emo_surprise|> This is the most high school post I’ve ever seen on this subreddit.
<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit was that the one guy that supported remain? I didn't know we had a celebrity on this board.
"<|emo_joy|> I do enjoy how insignificant the belltower looks in its surroundings nowadays. Still a waste of money. Thanks [NAME] of ""Wes-tern Australia""."
<|emo_fear|> Daddies little nightmare
"<|emo_anger|> No, this is not polyamory. It's assholery."
<|emo_anger|> Oh [NAME] this is going to garner such hate hahaha
<|emo_anger|> Fucking Real Madrid
<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid that will leave Britain no better. Can't imagine the ruckus if remain wins.
<|emo_disgust|> Disgusting. Truly disgusting.
<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised she could operate a suitcase.
<|emo_joy|> I bought the double barrel and fully upgraded it and now it's one of my favorite guns.
<|emo_sad|> I get needing a good education but what is with people acting like spending the most per student is a badge of honor?
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] damn it [NAME].
<|emo_disgust|> “Those floors with *that* paneling? Ugh! Disgusting!”
<|emo_joy|> Name one thing this person in power has said or done that’s racist. This should be fun..
<|emo_joy|> We could cure child cancer and pictures like this would still make me happier
<|emo_joy|> i’m happy you were able to have a child! that’s my biggest concern.
<|emo_surprise|> I'm with you. Would this news surprise me? Absolutely not. But I'm not believing anything regarding this subject unless it comes from [NAME] himself
<|emo_joy|> Goddamnit [NAME] back at it again...
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] the curse is real. This ones on you LeBatard.
<|emo_joy|> Sorry you had to live there. Good news is they are demolishing it in 2020.
<|emo_disgust|> Puppies in 95% of cases. Sorry but some dogs are ugly no matter how old they are.
<|emo_sad|> Man being unattractive in appearance has pretty much taken any joy out of my life
<|emo_joy|> That was fun
"<|emo_disgust|> If they're not spending this year on [NAME] or [NAME], I have no faith for them to spend on big free agents in the near future"
<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] all the cereal will be stuck soaking in milk until they get mushy and gross
<|emo_anger|> No worries. Just didn't see them. My bad.
<|emo_joy|> Stunning considering you have the exact same opinion.
"<|emo_anger|> Thanks, I hate it"
<|emo_surprise|> It blows my mind that there are still people out there that think pot is more dangerous than alcohol.
<|emo_anger|> That LOD is a moron
<|emo_joy|> I’m sorry this happened to you. I’m glad you got out of it.
"<|emo_disgust|> There has been the odd occasion without condoms. No deep penetration, but never the less. Some. I feel awful."
<|emo_anger|> What? Who said I hated him? I dont give a damn about him either way.
<|emo_joy|> Pleased to meet you. Hope you guess my name.
<|emo_fear|> How scary! She loves you! I hope you are ok.
<|emo_sad|> That's really sad and shocking to hear this Really embarrassed to be a human being on this earth...
<|emo_surprise|> it’s amazing how he is already just about my favourite skater ever.
<|emo_sad|> That poor soul
<|emo_anger|> Fuck so obvious
"<|emo_anger|> How dare you interrupt the circle jerk. Out, sir."
"<|emo_anger|> yeah, fuck [NAME]"
"<|emo_sad|> It just so happened that PD, sick kids , and family emergencies all happened to overlap between all my coworkers leaving me all alone. "
<|emo_anger|> It's super annoying. There is a reason I no longer speak to this person.
"<|emo_anger|> 22 hours and emailed support an hour ago, no answer yet. Will update here on progress."
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow man, that is DEAD. You have no marriage, just a roommate. Life is short, get out and find someone who meets your needs."
<|emo_disgust|> I did this and I regret nothing.
<|emo_joy|> Yeah I just saw that. The wheels are turnin' :)
<|emo_anger|> I'm appalled that your roommate straight up destroyed perfectly good leftovers that way
<|emo_disgust|> Wow! I feel like a grade A moron
"<|emo_sad|> This has happened to me with the girls I tried to connect with irl as well as FA ""lonely"" girls from this very sub"
<|emo_joy|> That. Is flipping Cute. He's definately a dog person.
<|emo_anger|> In the least condescending way possible I think you have some gross misconceptions and I'd like to clear them up.
"<|emo_joy|> That’s normal for girls, lol."
<|emo_anger|> I am getting a cursed vibe from this
"<|emo_surprise|> Wait, what? You're a gamer who's never even heard of TB?"
<|emo_joy|> Her parents are raising her to be a terrible person. Fantastic.
"<|emo_disgust|> Oh that's disgusting, this man should be sent to priso- ohh, it's America, ok then, feel free. "
<|emo_anger|> You dirty scavenger
"<|emo_joy|> This exchange made my day. From a female doc, thanks for getting it. "
<|emo_sad|> Damn it. Don't mention [NAME]. Just makes me sad thinking what could have been.
<|emo_joy|> It's so goddamn funny.
<|emo_sad|> And unfortunately videos like this act as a constant reminder that most people are complete dumbasses. Sad really.
<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry.
"<|emo_surprise|> Surprisingly, not a lot of people know though."
<|emo_sad|> Although every moment you suffer will last more too...
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] seems to have a sloppy stride
<|emo_anger|> USE GLOVES YOU MANIAC
<|emo_surprise|> Right. The comments people buy gold for astound me. I’ve seen some dumbass comments get gilded then comments that deserve it get nothing.
<|emo_joy|> What?! They must have thought they were at Disney.
"<|emo_anger|> The attraction and the action are two separate things, and you know that. No one chooses who they are attracted to. Stop it. "
<|emo_fear|> Oh my god... i JUST realized this!!! AHHHH this makes me SICK.
<|emo_anger|> These honestly are getting infuriating. The creator of this made this whole thing up yet Facebook old people take it as reality.
<|emo_joy|> Same. Gives me the attention and love feelings that humans have failed to give
<|emo_surprise|> Be sure to do the promo and get your free scope mount and magazines.
"<|emo_anger|> Huh, so there should be no more men's and women's sports, bathrooms, prisons, etc.?"
<|emo_surprise|> To be fair how often has someone drafted in the top 5 not immediately joined the team.
<|emo_surprise|> That’s awesome! I’ve seen this video tons of times! It’s one of my favs
<|emo_disgust|> I watched a video about fake makeup having rat piss in it. No thank you
<|emo_joy|> That's awesome to hear :)
<|emo_fear|> This makes me want to get nipple piercings but I’m too scared to :/
<|emo_anger|> No one gives a fuck about your internet points guy
"<|emo_disgust|> This is almost irritating. Like, take a breath, shithead..,"
<|emo_surprise|> This makes me want to die
"<|emo_sad|> It’s not so much the heat, it’s the humidity that’ll kill you."
<|emo_disgust|> The Cavs didn’t even want [NAME]. They just wanted to fuck with us.
<|emo_disgust|> That sucks :( are you guys still in good terms though?
<|emo_anger|> You shut your stupid mouth troll. Thy absolutely matter
<|emo_surprise|> Wow! This got far more real than I was anticipating.
<|emo_joy|> It would actually make me more comfortable if someone did that to me
<|emo_joy|> I'm not worthy to watch this haha
<|emo_joy|> Enjoy wes virginnie
<|emo_anger|> >ctrl + F > fuck your mother I am not disappointed.
<|emo_surprise|> This is the most upbeat and pleasant I've ever seen someone whose been caught with multiple ounces of weed and ecstasy.
<|emo_joy|> And it's stopped. Training cancelled :-)
"<|emo_disgust|> I may have awful taste, i would want this cake"
<|emo_disgust|> breaking news: sports fan does something extreme and stupid over something that doesn't matter
<|emo_anger|> Where the fuck is that Kepner rocks person when we need them the most.
"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, so many accidents occur because people don’t know what to do in the event of loss of tire grip."
<|emo_fear|> Delusion can be a powerful thing.
<|emo_anger|> That was horrible defending what the hell
<|emo_surprise|> Wow. This is messed up.
"<|emo_disgust|> Oh so you're being a troll, good to know.. I actually thought for a second that disgusting, freak couples like y'all actually existed"
<|emo_sad|> Yeah people used it as precedence. That’s very sad. What’s your point? What abhorrent treatment?
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] 12 min long? That other 1 min video spoiled me.
<|emo_joy|> I'd be more than happy to indulge this toothache.
"<|emo_sad|> Poor kitty. All you can do is give her extra treats, playtime and cuddles. "
<|emo_fear|> I’m scared.
<|emo_disgust|> Lmao!!! 🤣 He does look rather greasy.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow! You were either a very precocious child or still lived at home when your wisdom teeth came in.
"<|emo_sad|> You can't post a Sons pic and then say ""I got this"", that just hurts."
"<|emo_joy|> Wow, /r/noisygifs for real. First time I genuinely felt I could hear it."
"<|emo_anger|> WHAT?! You dare insult the band of gods?! Typical teen, I hate my own generation! *screams in 16 year old*"
<|emo_sad|> This made me incredibly happy and incredibly sad. Sometimes this universe robs us of the wrong people.
<|emo_disgust|> Win what exactly? A meaningless game in a very long season to be swept out of the playoffs? No thanks.
<|emo_disgust|> Every BP within cooeee of me is consistently 5-10 cents a liter higher than other options. Weird.
<|emo_anger|> Lol the fact that actual fans can't afford tickets is why there are let's go heat chants at this game
<|emo_joy|> 10/10 reading. I don't care if it happened this way or not. I was sufficiently entertained!
<|emo_disgust|> They've all fucked your mother. Just ask them.
<|emo_anger|> You're a mean person.
<|emo_disgust|> If she is an INFJ they can be quite caustic and verbally abusive at times.
"<|emo_joy|> Here we go, ya'll ready for WW3...this time we're the baddies! "
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if that was the original plan or if [NAME] just realized what [NAME] talked about and threw in that note to explain it.
"<|emo_surprise|> Unbelievable that we didn’t sign him Also, we could’ve potentially signed [NAME] the window we signed [NAME]. Kill me."
<|emo_anger|> OF COURSE IT WON FUCKIN PRETENTIOUS ASS FUCKING SLOW POINTLESS MOVIE OH BLACK AND WHITE WOWWWW
"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME] just yelling over each other and [NAME] looking around like what the...?"
<|emo_joy|> Thanks for sharing this with me btw. I shared the video with [NAME] and it was a hit
<|emo_disgust|> ugh.......
<|emo_joy|> So glad to hear they got banned. Can't believe adults can still behave like that.
<|emo_disgust|> Smoking is nasty.
<|emo_sad|> Dude got owned by a glass of cider. He spent a full month roiling and gnashing his teeth in an existential nightmare because of sulphites.
"<|emo_sad|> Yes, and when I do say ""no"" I'm filled with tremendous guilt. "
<|emo_anger|> You're taking her scale way too literally.
<|emo_joy|> St. Anger and All Nightmare Long are my favorite albums :))
<|emo_joy|> Yeah keep filming your kid kicking a dog in the face. I'm suprised this isn't on r/funny
<|emo_joy|> THATS WHAT SHE SAID...HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
"<|emo_surprise|> I couldn’t believe that. I’ve been mad but never enough to throw my PHONE! GIRL, what is you DOIN’?"
<|emo_surprise|> That’s v strange behaviour.
"<|emo_anger|> I can't stand when a team member has no shoes, the sound drowns out other sounds for me and its just incredibly annoying to listen to all game"
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, time to talk to the [NAME] about a FPTP alternative."
<|emo_surprise|> Look at the size of those shorts!
"<|emo_joy|> Haha I've got a mild case of UC, maybe I should be more dramatic about it and use it!"
<|emo_disgust|> So happy for [NAME]. So sad he's not here. Imagine this team with [NAME] instead of [NAME]. Ugh.
<|emo_surprise|> Unexpected Hail corporate.
<|emo_disgust|> Because he only won it begrudgingly last year. No one likes watching him play. [NAME] will win it unless [NAME] scores 40+ points like every game.
<|emo_fear|> Look at that thing...could tear you to shreds
"<|emo_sad|> They played a lot worse on Saturday. Saturday was really, really bad for me."
"<|emo_surprise|> oh [NAME], the fumbles.... all the fumbles"
<|emo_anger|> Let's do this shit. Michigan first half?
<|emo_fear|> We don't lmao. Anything with humans will have the same problems.
<|emo_anger|> Hates the patriarchy...has an iPhone designed by a man. So hypocrite can be added to the list of bullshit that makes up your personality
"<|emo_anger|> Utah is terrible, I hated driving through there at night"
<|emo_surprise|> It blows my mind that there are still people out there that think pot is more dangerous than alcohol.
<|emo_anger|> This is exactly what I told him. I went the fuck off. Lol
<|emo_surprise|> Have thought most of the game was OK with some bad calls both ways... These last 5 min tho...
<|emo_fear|> Watch [NAME] left arm and hand as he's on the floor. Scary.
<|emo_disgust|> Disgusting!!! Where were the adults? The adults probably felt proud of their sons. Fucken toxic culture
<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry for that.
<|emo_sad|> Tried that for a year and still scrawny and look young 😂
"<|emo_joy|> Dude, you made my day. "
<|emo_fear|> Power trip blindness is scary; how someone can't see the obvious aftermath of acting like this with their employees?
<|emo_fear|> That arena is so ugly I’d be scared too
<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] imagining this tween screaming yaaass queen at a poor drag queen made me cringe into a ball
<|emo_fear|> When you’re having a dream and the psycho is coming for you but you can’t move...
<|emo_joy|> The kind you enjoy & can fully devote yourself to.
<|emo_anger|> The most my dad did to help with the housework in 35+ years of their marriage was to lift his legs while mum vacuums around the couch
<|emo_joy|> I thought I could handle it but I was wrong. Good [NAME] was I wrong.
<|emo_joy|> this is proper funny actually
<|emo_surprise|> You are sexy af
<|emo_anger|> My bitch dun left me All alone She took mah squeeky ball And mah rasty bone
"<|emo_surprise|> I haven't seen a sign like that on mine. Not that it would carry the force of law, anyway, in Florida."
<|emo_anger|> Shameless karma whoring.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow! You were either a very precocious child or still lived at home when your wisdom teeth came in.
<|emo_surprise|> I've never been there before so I can't confirm or deny but I would be really surprised if a casino only had limit holdem
<|emo_sad|> I actually did have a girl a few towns away in a different school and no one knew her. No one believed me at first :(
<|emo_anger|> Quit being racist. They're just being racists.
<|emo_disgust|> She reminds me if [NAME]. Half haked pictures with vague sayings. Ugh
<|emo_anger|> What’s wrong with this
<|emo_disgust|> Mad stinky.
<|emo_anger|> Don't worry about stupid people and you do whatever you want. Screw them kind of people.
<|emo_anger|> what the fuck do you learn in first grade that’s so important anyway?
<|emo_joy|> I hope you enjoy endless mosquitoes as the climate warms.
<|emo_anger|> You didn't tell me there was a gas lesk!
<|emo_surprise|> *Poop hole* Oooohwee!
<|emo_anger|> You basically already know the entire series for how much they've talked about it and how brazenly they spoil it.
<|emo_joy|> Hahah Yea imagine what the GM guys will do when the DD app crashes for hours
<|emo_sad|> I literally cried out IS THAT MATT BERRY?!?!?!?!?!
"<|emo_anger|> Yes, is there any way we can do this? Cos fuck that POS."
<|emo_anger|> I skimmed poorly and thought it said 4 people (independently) discovered their data was accessed

<|emo_anger|> Soooo.... He basically just admitted he didn’t get his kid shit for Christmas. What a fucking asshole!
<|emo_disgust|> I want to say that but I feel like I'd get too much shit

"<|emo_sad|> Yeah I regret ever moving to Leduc. It's one of the most backwoods, proud-to-be-ignorant communities I've ever seen."
<|emo_joy|> Yeehaw! It's time for a hoedown!!!!
<|emo_surprise|> The white thing high up in the yellow square is my uncle [NAME] glass eye. Wonder how it got there.

"<|emo_joy|> Very tired us can attendant: ""here are your vagina slimes."" ... thankfully the customer just laughed kt off."
<|emo_joy|> >she looks like squidward when she smiles LOOOL
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry to disappoint, we are working very hard as employees to turn this thing around. Hopefully we can change your mind in the future. "
<|emo_surprise|> Wow dude. That's the clumsiest promotion I've seen
<|emo_disgust|> Asshole w cash amount
<|emo_disgust|> No! Your the dumbass for leaving the keys in the car! Again DUMBASS!!!!!
<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid I'm gonna have to go with what he said about an hour ago. Unicorns. He just ruled out any sort of
<|emo_anger|> This cracked me up!
<|emo_joy|> Left handers are rejoicing over this
"<|emo_disgust|> I have seen some terrible minion stuff, I thought I've seen the worst of the worst. I was wrong...I was horribly wrong."

<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] IS STILL THE ONLY QB IN THE NFC NORTH WITH A PLAYOFF WIN!
"<|emo_fear|> I have seen some terrible minion stuff, I thought I've seen the worst of the worst. I was wrong...I was horribly wrong."
<|emo_disgust|> There are two different accounts doing this shit atm. Go to r/delusionalartists and sort by new. These guys are being douchebags.
<|emo_joy|> It still cracks me up when people call me [NAME].
<|emo_disgust|> I like the new colors significantly better. Old ones might have been some of the worst in OWL.
"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] fucking [NAME] are you done yet racist motherfucker, you’re not helping society"
<|emo_fear|> It certainly reeks of the same kind of scam.
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is bae, how dare you."
<|emo_joy|> so [NAME] isn't necessarily as dumb as she literally appears... I've always liked her for some reason.
"<|emo_anger|> ""Talk about vaccines again and your next shot will be from my gun... of crystals bathed in essential oils"""
"<|emo_joy|> Trust me, I my self wish it happened before this filming"
<|emo_joy|> Glad to see [NAME] back
<|emo_joy|> I was so happy for cowboy
"<|emo_disgust|> A pencil skirt is tight around the hips with a slit in the back, not swishy. Does that make sense?"
"<|emo_joy|> Someone made this album, dwights a bit lanky but I enjoyed it. "
<|emo_sad|> I put so much thought into things that often I trigger myself unintentionally. I can be hurt before something has a chance to happen.
<|emo_sad|> They bothered to attack darling in the franxx
"<|emo_surprise|> He kept talking about Israel, its security, and how Arab nations are slowly welcoming them. How times have changed..."
<|emo_sad|> And the sad part is this goes on for decades and decades grrrrrrr
<|emo_sad|> A lot of people call that this is only one they made her sick
<|emo_surprise|> I was wondering what that was!
<|emo_sad|> Oh come on! Stop posting this stuff. FFS will you think of my blood pressure!? You’re killing me (figuratively speaking).
<|emo_anger|> Weird that a movie star is dating a hot young model?... like what’s weird about that
<|emo_joy|> my favorite moment in the history of the show is when he thrashed that woman.
<|emo_joy|> Who is bored? I happily entertain myself.
<|emo_anger|> Damn it.
<|emo_surprise|> I've never woken up to a fan around my throat.
<|emo_surprise|> I am stunned
"<|emo_disgust|> Just gonna be mean here, those are all hideous :("
<|emo_surprise|> Surprised [NAME] didn't add his hatred of interracial couples in the movie.
"<|emo_surprise|> You really went in to detail, and with valid points. Δ "
"<|emo_joy|> im glad to hear that i won't just be carted off! and thanks, it's great to know that you guys have my back :)"
<|emo_anger|> Thank you for ruining the [NAME] joke.
"<|emo_disgust|> Oh no that's so awkward, I don't understand how people don't understand how weird things like that are! "
<|emo_joy|> I will GLADLY tell him to his face. And have.
"<|emo_disgust|> The questions are normal enough, but all at once and leading with them is a little weird."
<|emo_disgust|> Sorry you’re not allowed to be a Vikings fan anymore then
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] I hate this
<|emo_joy|> Enjoy the ahuahuasca
<|emo_joy|> Just made my first robocough purchase. Glad I used the website
<|emo_joy|> Funny I’m on my second play through and this happens...
<|emo_disgust|> Disgusting performance. [NAME] appears clueless.
<|emo_anger|> Uhhhh... didn’t y’all just eat the light lunch that you said you wanted on your preference sheets? Shut up.
<|emo_surprise|> This is a restaurant in a hotel so it had a strange vibe.
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad you're safe - but don't feel sorry for him. He knows what he is doing.
"<|emo_disgust|> Screw DBs swill, their creepy Children of God (cult) employees, and the traffic mess it creates on Rural in Tempe"
"<|emo_fear|> Yeah, that was terrible. [NAME] laughing and joking at the end of that game ended his career here."
"<|emo_joy|> Haha WEHO, for West Hollywood, not Wehoe for We hoes"
"<|emo_anger|> I'm saying put up or shut up. If you can't back up your point with evidence, your opinion is worthless. "
<|emo_joy|> Happy day! Five years from now you will be a top ten player in the NHL.
<|emo_joy|> Good luck buddy!
<|emo_joy|> Well I am happy you believe that.
"<|emo_disgust|> On VPR yes she is awful. On WWHL she seems very nice, and likeable. Not sure what's going on there. "
<|emo_surprise|> A long term relationship with pizza? Wow talk about accurate!
"<|emo_anger|> Screw DBs swill, their creepy Children of God (cult) employees, and the traffic mess it creates on Rural in Tempe"
<|emo_sad|> i'm so poor i don't even know any horse girls
"<|emo_sad|> This is the sad truth for the exact reason he mentioned, they want a short fix to avoid doing this type of hard work."
<|emo_anger|> I understand your frustration with [NAME] hate but [NAME] as a character though... /s
<|emo_sad|> The fact this isn't a [NAME] Attorney at Law Gif about this makes me kinda sad.
<|emo_fear|> I can just do it with my eyes open. Is that weird? It kind of hurts.
<|emo_joy|> Maybe you need some time get loss of that thought. Try to ignore it and just enjoy your luck.
<|emo_sad|> That’d be lovely. Although now I have to root for AD to the Lakers which makes my chest hurt
"<|emo_anger|> You fucking got this bb, one step at a time. The DD is here for you."
<|emo_disgust|> SHUT THAT SOFT ASS SHIT UP
<|emo_joy|> CBA's app is atrocious. I had to set it up on my mother's new iPhone and it was a nightmare.
<|emo_surprise|> Mommy bad man!!!
"<|emo_sad|> Same. You all tried to save me, but I rewatched with the sound on and... I have regrets."
"<|emo_sad|> Im sorry that I'm only able to give a single upvote for this wonderful, graphic, and accurate visualization."
"<|emo_surprise|> Ha! Had to go back and look. Pens.... I was seriously wondering wtf this was, a giant penis-shaped gummy bear?!"
<|emo_fear|> I don't feel so financially secure
<|emo_sad|> Thats fair. I know its a joke it just always struck me as odd how people wrote it off. No worries.
<|emo_fear|> BP can bulwark counter A good number of deflects and even drop attacks We have more than that to worry about
<|emo_disgust|> This grammar is horrible. Discovering something is a fixed single point in history which should have been simple past “was” instead of “had been.”
"<|emo_surprise|> The best one for me is still Borderlands 2, and it’s been a fucking while. Amazing how far ahead of its time that game was."
<|emo_joy|> Glad she's not living in a bubble then....
<|emo_joy|> Ah that video
<|emo_disgust|> I feel like that’s the least disgusting option. Imagine a penis or vaginal canal made out of fingers.
<|emo_joy|> I’m happy I could help. Let me know if it works
<|emo_joy|> Glad to see we are still around :).
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is the most useless phantom thief change my mind
"<|emo_disgust|> Bohemian Rhapsody is a horrible song. Really horrible. Queen had a lot of great songs, but that one wasn't one of them."
<|emo_fear|> This is so cute and wholesome? How is this terrible
<|emo_fear|> I’m as terrified of Mr. [NAME] just as much as any sane person but I don’t think we should *burn* him...
<|emo_anger|> #Fuck the cowgirls & iggles
"<|emo_joy|> Oh I'm contributing mate, don't you worry. The sub clown has been made to look like a knob again! Enjoy your Sunday night x"
<|emo_anger|> What the hell was that
<|emo_joy|> Min Gung in Glastonbury also has all you can eat sushi. Always a good time!
"<|emo_surprise|> Wonder if her steel balls make the same sound, clanging together, when they're frozen?"
<|emo_anger|> Even if it’s available 24/7 on your new website 99% of it is ugly so people still won’t buy it.
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] was only OP when it came out. [NAME] was OP for so long. I'm still happy they finally did something to her.
<|emo_surprise|> I would be impressed if [NAME] ate 15% of his weight every day I wish I lived in a state where the contest was valid. Stupid NY
<|emo_joy|> Ha at least you’re in on the joke.
<|emo_joy|> I prefer console and most of my friends play cod. I still enjoy gbs every year

<|emo_anger|> FUCKKNG PLEASE 🙏🙏🙏
<|emo_fear|> Shock collars are horrible. They poor pup. 😫
"<|emo_disgust|> Oh no, her eyebrows"
<|emo_disgust|> then its lost man. So sad!...its terrible
<|emo_anger|> Move bitch get out the way.
"<|emo_joy|> I gotchu bro, house By Gucci Mane I’m a huge Gucci mane fan. "
<|emo_anger|> Because it's so ridiculously stupid people just can't help themselves.
<|emo_sad|> I wish I could be you. Our thing is dragging on forever and I’m heartbroken af.
"<|emo_sad|> As an [NAME], I apologize for the cranky old conservatives who are probably making ridiculously uninformed comments about your country right now :/"
<|emo_joy|> The funny/awful part is how well [NAME] works photoshopped in.
<|emo_joy|> Sexy Unique Podcast (SUP) for all your VPR needs!
"<|emo_joy|> Here, here. Cheers to starting fresh!"
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] is ugly btw
"<|emo_surprise|> I just got there and saw ""Chicken Pox"" When the image is about smallpox"
<|emo_joy|> That's so refreshing. Thanks a lot!
"<|emo_disgust|> They get pissy about ""automatic defenses"" for property. I mean, *REALLY* pissy."
<|emo_sad|> Despite her being on a plastic surgery page getting botox and commenting that it didn’t hurt 🙄
<|emo_fear|> Exactly right? That's when I thought she was really really horrible.
"<|emo_surprise|> I was so scared, I thought the kid was going to backpedal into a street."
<|emo_sad|> Really seemed like a great guy :(
<|emo_joy|> wow that's next level here. I am familiar with people dangerously going over 2+ lanes and the zebras but I have never seen that in DFW.
"<|emo_fear|> It was intentional. Maybe not with much thought behind it, but a very dangerous instinct."
<|emo_disgust|> And I thought they smelled bad on the outside!
<|emo_disgust|> Worst feeling ever
<|emo_joy|> I’ve tried a few times on mobile and it never works for some reason. Edit: just logged on at work and fixed it. Feels good
<|emo_surprise|> Hey Man! Your house is on fire! All you gotta do is look just turn around and look!
<|emo_surprise|> Just wondering how they did it visually with all the fireworks going on
<|emo_surprise|> Yeah - thanks - I vaguely remember this. I wonder what her net worth was year by year? Too lazy to investigate.
<|emo_fear|> That was the only place I saw and their pictures looked horrible. Might just have to go to the source and vacation in southern Asia
<|emo_joy|> it's a good thing they had a screen protector on it
<|emo_fear|> Not terribly many of those jumping fences in the UK I think. :P
<|emo_sad|> that was so sad :(
"<|emo_surprise|> Huh, I was just wondering if something like this existed. I'm working in food manafacturing an this would be epic."
<|emo_anger|> I can scream HEH MOOMEN
<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Uh...good luck.
"<|emo_joy|> Downtown is inconvenient, look like you've gone full county, enjoy your strip mall "
"<|emo_surprise|> Wait, what? [NAME] wasn't allowed a *bank account*?"
"<|emo_joy|> Congrats! Enjoy a free slice, I think you know what to do with this 🍕"
"<|emo_surprise|> For those who are wondering, that would leave you with about $1,000,000"
<|emo_sad|> Sorry. This happens to too many good people.
<|emo_joy|> Lmao. I fucking love this community.
<|emo_fear|> She is a horrible person and that is what makes her so relatable in real life.
<|emo_joy|> I turned the news on around 6 this morning and have never been so happy to have a commute of 4 miles to my job
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] can’t you see, you’re being way too loud for me"
"<|emo_anger|> *insert [NAME] talnkig about how they will love you but they will hate you, but it's [NAME] instead of [NAME].*"
<|emo_joy|> She has at least 12 elbows and all of them are happy. You get it gurl
<|emo_disgust|> It’s an imperfect poll demographic group skewing erroneously towards a “No”. [NAME] was incredible this week.
"<|emo_joy|> Weird, I checked again and it works for me now. It wasn't the first few times I tried to click."
<|emo_sad|> You make it hard
<|emo_disgust|> These people are so full of hate it's disgusting and disheartening at the same time. How do you de-radicalize these people?
<|emo_disgust|> Damn that was ugly
"<|emo_fear|> Oh thank you for the name, is there any way to get rid of them? "
<|emo_joy|> > Do you think Amazon reviews are don't mean anything? Yes because they are very easy to game.
<|emo_disgust|> *ads even more trashier
<|emo_joy|> I love this game already
<|emo_disgust|> And you can't really see the bottom part so that's probably small too. Really grosses me out
<|emo_sad|> I’ve been hurt too many times for it all to have been for nothing
<|emo_surprise|> > ftw Awesome statistic. Made my day! Love it
"<|emo_surprise|> if he would only have any marketable skills, alas I think he is going to serve hard time"
<|emo_fear|> This is amazing and terrifiying
<|emo_joy|> Ah ok I thought by terrific you mean terrific at reducing speeding since (I think) that is the policy objective. Cheers!
"<|emo_surprise|> Holy fuck, that save was on what was essentially a wide open net"
"<|emo_sad|> The point of an Umeshism is that 'half-baked' is often optimal, or as [NAME] put it, ""Anything worth doing is worth doing badly."""
"<|emo_anger|> That's just....sorry, but stupid is the only correct word."
<|emo_joy|> I like how the title contradicts the subreddit it’s posted on.
<|emo_surprise|> Did she happen to find a magical ring before she drown?
<|emo_sad|> Very frustrating. And totally the fault of your school’s systems for handling the issue. Sorry you have to deal with it.
<|emo_joy|> I’d love for [NAME] to turn into prime [NAME]
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] reaction gives me life. His reaction when they got punched last episode was amazing too.
<|emo_surprise|> Ah. I should've noticed that after my grandma shared it on FaceBook
"<|emo_surprise|> See also: ""Useless College Degrees From Prestigious and Ridiculously Overpriced Universities"""
<|emo_anger|> I should've left after the first period ended. That was brutal.
<|emo_anger|> Fuck i know. I'm so worried for girls like me growing up now.
<|emo_surprise|> It's also surprising that Valve released a dud game. Maybe it's time for Valve to grow up and introduce themselves to the digital communication age?
<|emo_sad|> I mourn for you anti-intellectuals
"<|emo_disgust|> Not out of a trash can though, surely? That'd be disgusting."
<|emo_joy|> Happy cake day!
<|emo_sad|> That is awful. :(
"<|emo_surprise|> Gotcha. I was married a few years before that, but you might have known my sister. She dated a guy in your branch named [NAME]"
"<|emo_fear|> If an AI projectile is your biggest problem you've got bigger issues, next. "
<|emo_fear|> This is so scary but true
<|emo_sad|> I did not even realize he was injured...
<|emo_joy|> Aww that makes me happy!
<|emo_sad|> Sadly they aren't in control. [NAME] is and he'll always do the worst possible thing.
<|emo_disgust|> Tbh as creepy as this post is I was way more sexually active back when I was 16-20 than I am today Kids are horny 💁‍♂️ Idk
<|emo_surprise|> So hard to believe that this comment isn`t being ridiculed. I want some of what you guys are smoking.
<|emo_disgust|> I’ve exposed on social media. It made me feel better so I don’t care what anyway has to say about it.
<|emo_anger|> Side deflects are stupid hard to pull off imo also because you might be used to 500ms lights or slower heavies for deflects his 600ms lights might throw you off
"<|emo_anger|> Shoot him, or something."
<|emo_fear|> It is an absolutely horrible ultimate I agree after 400 hours on doom I still hate it
<|emo_anger|> u fucked up
<|emo_anger|> Happy New Year to all my fellow Asuka mains and all you dirty bastards who show no hespect. Cheers!
<|emo_joy|> So those 2am cravings are really just my instincts keeping me alive
<|emo_disgust|> What's ridiculous is this stupid post and this asinine idea that white people are these constant victims
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] damn it [NAME]!
"<|emo_joy|> My god, what is WRONG with people? So glad you’re okay, OP!!"
<|emo_sad|> I still think he should have been the first goalie in the 2014 World Cup. But alas that injury ruined everything.
<|emo_anger|> It's soccer. He was faking the injury anyway.
<|emo_joy|> Congrats!!
<|emo_anger|> Don’t blame us because you’re a dumbass..
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] is there anything more depressing than being in a leafs gdt when the leafs are losing.
"<|emo_joy|> This exchange made my day. From a female doc, thanks for getting it. "
"<|emo_anger|> Those refs were terrible, god damn. GG Buckeyes, it was much closer than the score suggests."
<|emo_anger|> Didn't really help who the Master is but [NAME] will lose his damn mind. We video game worlds now.
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, hi, we doing a greenhat circlejerk rn?"
<|emo_fear|> Right? I think [NAME] needs to be careful cause I could def see [NAME] snapping.
"<|emo_sad|> In all seriousness, stereotyping does suck and I feel for you. But stop being a crazy horse lady and maybe you can change people's minds. Lol"
<|emo_disgust|> I hate [NAME] but this dude has already lied to Congress. How can you believe anything he says
<|emo_surprise|> Right?? The hypocrisy with the [NAME] situation is STAGGERING.
<|emo_anger|> I remember that one! She was so proud of herself for all the organization and I just felt bad for the kids.
"<|emo_joy|> *""Wow""*"
<|emo_disgust|> I don't think either of them took that bump outside any worse than the other. That was jarring.
<|emo_joy|> I really felt for this mother. You could tell how frustrated and exasperated she was. Glad she was there to stand up for her kids.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow good on you! I hope to have similar progress this year. How’d you do it?
"<|emo_anger|> It's time to feel the fucking Bern, America. "
<|emo_anger|> She was literally the worst manager I’ve ever worked for
<|emo_joy|> I got a lot of withholding to throw me into anxiety.
<|emo_joy|> Way braver than me. Hope you have a great night. Cheers!
<|emo_disgust|> It *feels* unethical?
"<|emo_joy|> Yep California, I would've been surprised if they cleared him."
<|emo_anger|> I will never forgive and never forget for this one
<|emo_anger|> This is racist
"<|emo_fear|> Oh god, [NAME] is terrible. My kid loves it though, and Dr [NAME]"
<|emo_anger|> It infuriates me how many layers of tape these things have sometimes.
"<|emo_disgust|> Holy crap, that movie was bad."
<|emo_sad|> That's really sad and shocking to hear this Really embarrassed to be a human being on this earth...
<|emo_disgust|> that’s awful🤣🤣
<|emo_disgust|> The usual suspects will all belive her to be a victim and pretend there is no reason she would lie.
<|emo_anger|> What an idiot.
<|emo_sad|> Hello fellow boiler [NAME] is in the hospital again with grout call soon xx
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah it’s not like I want my cat to lick me in a sexual way that’s just weird.
<|emo_fear|> I was in awe the whole hour I spent in there.
<|emo_disgust|> FYI your boyfriends fucking her too.
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad you liked it :D
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] i really hate entitled people. Upvote if you think that EPs are worse than Antivaxxers.
"<|emo_joy|> Not one single figure anywhere to be seen. Reminds me of auld Soviet propaganda. ""The harvest is up"" ""People happier than ever"""
<|emo_sad|> Oh. That is unfortunate
<|emo_joy|> Love the whole lebatard community but she has the most confidence speaking and it shows up on all the shows she does
<|emo_joy|> I cheered for the Superbowl to be canceled
<|emo_surprise|> The miracle was just that. Because we all know the Vikings would fail the next game.
"<|emo_joy|> I'm glad the bears lost, but damn I feel so bad for [NAME]. The entire Chicago fan base will want him dead"
<|emo_joy|> Bit of a clickbait title. He said it's normal for a big club to sack a manager that's lost a lot of points.
<|emo_sad|> I flew off the handle and that's my bad.
<|emo_disgust|> Lol the actual state of this Nothing wrong with pointing out [NAME] was a cunt snowflake Suppose it makes a change from your usual woman hating posts
"<|emo_sad|> I couldn't let [NAME] become carver.. I regret it. [NAME] didn't deserve this, although he was fucking stupid to let his guard down"
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] a drama queen?! Surely you jest./s
<|emo_joy|> Happy cake day bruh
<|emo_joy|> I'm always happy to have you in my box.
<|emo_sad|> I was so sad when they took SG1 off of Netflix. I guess it’s on Prime now? I need to rewatch that show.
<|emo_anger|> Well someone took Freaky Friday to #10...
<|emo_surprise|> They’re more and more surprised every week when this is reposted.
<|emo_surprise|> What the heck did I just watch
"<|emo_anger|> Hey [NAME]! **TRY DRAWING TWO CARDS NOW, YOU STUPID FUCKING BASTARD!!**"
<|emo_surprise|> It took a surprisingly long time for this to be seen by me on this sub.
<|emo_sad|> There’s a reason southern states have a massive teacher shortage. Please do yourself a favor a consider that before you take the leap.
<|emo_joy|> This meme describes how I feel about 2018 pretty accurately. Cheers to a golden 2019!
"<|emo_disgust|> ummmm Wulp I personally love a feminine man. I prefer it, ‘manly men’ are gross and stupid "
"<|emo_fear|> You should be much, much more worried about a rise in fascism than pedophilia. Thinking that pedophilia will be normal is just plain paranoid."
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] having a horrible night
"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, you're completely right. I'm an idiot. I'll be here eating my words."
<|emo_joy|> She seems like such a happy kid too!
<|emo_anger|> - But mom! I don’t wanna go to school today! - You’re going little shit.
<|emo_sad|> Even that game winning kick was close. Our kickers are cursed.
<|emo_joy|> The Button was amazingly fun. By far my favourite reddit memory.
<|emo_anger|> that was such a misstep from their PR. wtf were they thinking people were expecting with a public countdown
<|emo_joy|> Wha? I'd love more background on this.
<|emo_surprise|> the fact that [NAME] still exists is somehow the strangest thing about this
<|emo_joy|> I'm so sorry for your loss. One of my favourite unisex names is [NAME].
<|emo_disgust|> Probably people being inappropriate and making light that police officers are number 14 on the list of most dangerous jobs in the
"<|emo_anger|> Yawning at the insults to me, not the Woman"
"<|emo_joy|> My favorite kind of chilled delectable from Georgia. Sort of like candy apples, but crunchier. "
"<|emo_disgust|> My opinion is that this person's opinion is stupid, fallacious, and bad."
<|emo_surprise|> no way I have never heard of that! wow!
<|emo_surprise|> Wow what's it like to be so petty? (Fixed)
"<|emo_anger|> You're with him, you brought him here to kill me."
<|emo_sad|> Damn that’s sad
"<|emo_joy|> Lol. Well, I enjoyed our heart to heart either way "
"<|emo_anger|> I was, and it's not. He's mad that someone posts articles he disagrees with. Pathetic and his fury is deranged "
<|emo_fear|> Just threaten to tell the bishop your roommate is a porn addict. 80% chance it's true.
<|emo_anger|> Then it'll hurt more when I kick it in the balls.
<|emo_joy|> This makes me so happy for you ♥️ I am glad you are getting the right kind of support you need!
<|emo_disgust|> It’s ugly. Bye bye and good riddance.
<|emo_joy|> Knife Fight used to be an awesome cooking comp show
<|emo_anger|> Now you tell me! I’m heading at high speed towards a one-third-life crisis and need a change.
<|emo_sad|> I think I met you. Sorry if I was a bit standoffish.
"<|emo_anger|> Fuck the White House, fuck McDonald’s and fuck this post."
<|emo_joy|> I'm really enjoying Season 3 but this would ruin it for me.
<|emo_disgust|> I’m just gonna go ahead and call bullshit on most of the details of this story.
"<|emo_joy|> I know I’m late, but happy cake day :D"
<|emo_surprise|> I don't see anything about harassment in that statement. Weird.
<|emo_joy|> I love the immediate cut from the gladiator dying to the defeat screen. Makes it funnier
<|emo_surprise|> Are you sincerely saying that [NAME] are bad because they were in the minority?
<|emo_sad|> if [NAME] got a divorce he would stop doing this
<|emo_anger|> 1 is the lie. I'm cheating because I remember this convo from last week.
<|emo_disgust|> Me too. Scorpion sounds so odd now
<|emo_sad|> I’m gonna sit down and cry now
<|emo_anger|> I AM COMPARING THE TITLES YOU OVERGROWN CABBAGE
"<|emo_joy|> Yes! I used to do this all the time actually, especially go to the mall alone. It was actually really nice."
<|emo_anger|> Because idiots in this sub care too much about what other people have on their screen? It only tells me that too many people on here are narcissists.
"<|emo_sad|> It's sad, but yes, zero. "
<|emo_joy|> That was awesome. Momentum is really something isn't it?

"<|emo_disgust|> It’s a shame, I’ve had numerous friends with disabilities but I’ve never treated them any less then my friends without."
<|emo_sad|> Vote every one of them out that was quoted as being upset about the wire and not the corruption.
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, those dreadful things. I gave those away."
"<|emo_surprise|> Wait, wut? I thought there was some sort of (2) term pledge from"
<|emo_sad|> Imagine thinking like this. I feel kinda bad for them.
<|emo_anger|> What a load of old shite.
<|emo_sad|> What did you use to kill them all? Sorry I’m kinda a noob
<|emo_sad|> F for our fallen comrade
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] man..... I hope this is just one of his overdramatic moments on the floor... He's scared me like 5 times this year....
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah this bothers me. Family should be off limits, and this scene was really sad"
"<|emo_anger|> damn, i always get in on these too late"
"<|emo_sad|> I'm strange as fuck, and I didn't grow up with money."
<|emo_joy|> I was there in 89-91. Some of the best years of my life.
"<|emo_sad|> > I just take their word for it that **some** of them find **some** things offensive, and their reasons why. "
<|emo_joy|> Who is bored? I happily entertain myself.
<|emo_surprise|> Because his reconnaissance is not unique in any way. Literally everyone who saw that movie thought that was surprising.
"<|emo_disgust|> More like [NAME] stalker,lol."
"<|emo_joy|> There's having fun and being a hoe, OP seem to assume what she is, so ni worries for her. "
<|emo_fear|> Hes not the best at communication which is a big red flag in my book
<|emo_sad|> I know and that made me sad!
<|emo_sad|> Also i think that person is really shitty and I’m sorry you experienced that. People are animals sometimes.
"<|emo_joy|> Damn...perspective is good, Haha. Then again [NAME], that's some awesome architecture. Early 1900s?"
"<|emo_sad|> Don't cry for me, Argentina."
<|emo_anger|> Yea I guess I did. I forget how popular the bulls brand is overall. I just hate when people call others dumb because they talk/tweet in slang.
"<|emo_anger|> No offense, but your parents are assholes."
<|emo_sad|> So glad you got justice and closure. You can properly begin to heal now. I’m not sure I ever will get the same sadly
"<|emo_disgust|> He was an awful HC, is in his 70s and has repeatedly said he doesn’t want to do it again. "
"<|emo_anger|> ""If you don't support no go zones, you are racist!"""
<|emo_anger|> No need to bully me.
<|emo_joy|> Here comes a dildo... Hope it's not a crusty one...
"<|emo_sad|> Can we ban posts about him now he's a predator? It just makes me sad now, Idk about anyone else"
<|emo_anger|> Soooo.... He basically just admitted he didn’t get his kid shit for Christmas. What a fucking asshole!
<|emo_anger|> Can't even do that anymore :(
<|emo_anger|> My arms are hairier than yours and my husband has never minded.
<|emo_fear|> omgad that monster!
<|emo_sad|> ~~24 hours is for an adult. Adults can get lost but they have means to come back home if they are just lost~~ Edit: forgive my ignorance
<|emo_disgust|> You cant pick and choose racism you dippy cunt
<|emo_anger|> >So that was a **fucking** lie. FTFY.
<|emo_anger|> Damn these refs actually fucking hate us.
<|emo_joy|> Finally something nice
"<|emo_joy|> Very happy to hear that. I hope he keeps at it, and is open and honest with them."
"<|emo_joy|> Haha, well it sounds like its done too good of a job!"
"<|emo_joy|> They stole my joke, damn them!"
<|emo_sad|> THIS IS TRAUMATISING
"<|emo_fear|> Pretty terrifying. Imagine if you went on a school trip, did nothing, and came home to this."
"<|emo_fear|> Tl, dr - Take the abuse. Squirming only gets them off more."
<|emo_surprise|> Can't believe people like this actually exist.
<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry to hear this. I hope you can find something to make you feel happy in the new year.
<|emo_disgust|> So THIS is the Bad Place!
<|emo_anger|> OMG BARF wtf is wrong with people?!
<|emo_anger|> How dare you say that. He's a toad of the people! Not some rich frog!
<|emo_joy|> I love to see the Celtics give up [NAME] and [NAME] only to have [NAME] walk to literally any other team
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] Immediately thought of you when I saw this thread. Can’t stop laughing. But. I’ll wear yours someday and no others
<|emo_joy|> I dunno...it was used for a meme and it's very fun to look at
<|emo_joy|> I spent a few months in LA and it freaked me out every time someone zoomed past me.
<|emo_fear|> The third picture is creepy.
<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit that’s nothing
<|emo_fear|> It hurts to snap out of that denial and face the truth your loved ones are dead... I guess.
"<|emo_anger|> Like, there is an insufficient causal relationship for it to be an expectation to work with assholes."
<|emo_disgust|> Awful taste hmmmmm
<|emo_sad|> Still saddened by the fact that we never got to see prime [NAME] vs prime [NAME].
<|emo_anger|> Oh sod off.
<|emo_anger|> That head must hurt!
<|emo_disgust|> This is why I stopped watching. :( The brutality was disgusting.
<|emo_sad|> I'm nauseous
<|emo_disgust|> except for the implication that white colonialism saved the native population from barbarism
"<|emo_fear|> While I don't wish anyone death or even harm, I also wouldn't mourn his death."
"<|emo_fear|> Sometimes I think it's like the movie *Shallow Hal*. You see the person for who they really are on the inside, and it's terrifying."
<|emo_surprise|> It’s like she’s forcing a fake British accent it’s so strange
<|emo_joy|> i have this comic and I love this bit!
<|emo_joy|> I like it better this way!
"<|emo_anger|> $42,000 fine over a JOKE is unreasonable. "
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad you're safe - but don't feel sorry for him. He knows what he is doing.

<|emo_joy|> its here! nice
<|emo_disgust|> I feel like this list is way off base from what we've been hearing.
"<|emo_joy|> Ridiculous. That kid didn’t do anything. Just stood there and smiled, while waiting for his bus. You’re crazy."
<|emo_fear|> I never knew this! Nuts are a total fear food for me
<|emo_disgust|> Same. All other map on OG with SSD were fine. [NAME] drops and it's terrible.
"<|emo_anger|> Happy birthday to that gold thong wearing, porn stache sporting son of a bitch!"
<|emo_anger|> SHUUUUUT UP THIS IS TOO TRUE
<|emo_surprise|> It could be bait and switch... Which would be a surprise
<|emo_disgust|> What I’m getting from all but the second is that mothers have become less abusive to their children.
"<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell thought he was dead, seriously."
<|emo_joy|> I have pretty bad anxiety and have recently adopted two kittens. I definitely feel less anxious when I'm around them as they are such sweet animals.
"<|emo_anger|> The article was about LEGAL delivery, you big dummy. I too love when people without knowledge of a situation respond like they know what’s what."
<|emo_joy|> Boiled peanuts are my happy food.
<|emo_disgust|> Benzos do not help anxiety long term. they make it worse
<|emo_surprise|> Dementia is in my family so this is pretty exciting. I also have to wonder if this bacteria could cause other kinds of mental illnesses..
<|emo_fear|> migraines suck. Hope you feel better.
<|emo_anger|> You get closure by blocking her on your phone and all social media. She dumped you. It's over.
<|emo_joy|> Glad you learned from it m8 and hopefully you are doing okay now
<|emo_sad|> Please don't think the way they're trolling represents us [NAME]. I'm sorry this happened.
<|emo_joy|> oh I relate. I’ve spent many a hour on that game (;; . _ .)
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, your sister has problems. It seems like [NAME] deserves free Netflix for dealing with that"
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow this was an eye-opening response, and you’re right it helped us learn more, be compassionate and focus on a better well-being."
<|emo_surprise|> Wow. It looks really good!
<|emo_joy|> I can't tell you how happy I am that [NAME] and [NAME] are Polynesian Sauce guys.
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] are you me? Like I was relating and then you said rot in Atlanta traffic and the pains of 285 burned into my mind.
<|emo_joy|> I love the fact that he is a complicated character makes it challenging
<|emo_surprise|> It's natural selection when a mentally ill person shoots and kills an innocent person out of the blue? Wow... just wow....
<|emo_disgust|> This sounds like the kind of comment my weird uncle would leave on my Facebook post.
<|emo_anger|> Son of a bitch... here we go. Can't just stand there guys....
<|emo_anger|> Then it'll hurt more when I kick it in the balls.
<|emo_disgust|> Something is rotten in Deutschland.
<|emo_anger|> I play teemo support and nobody can stop me.
<|emo_disgust|> It only gets worse kiddo. Someone call [NAME] and get this girl an upgrade.
<|emo_joy|> cheers friend. same thing happened to me 2 days ago. hazzah!
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn you're toxic asf
<|emo_anger|> Instant karma for an impatient jackass who doesn't deserve the right to drive.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow. He might actually lose Iowa
"<|emo_surprise|> Omg someone gave me SILVER?! Idk what this even is but 1,000,000 🐃 to you!"
"<|emo_joy|> *""Success is the best revenge.""* Good job OP. Stay strong. You're almost there."
<|emo_sad|> She reminds me if [NAME]. Half haked pictures with vague sayings. Ugh
<|emo_sad|> This is his reaction to being crucified:
<|emo_joy|> Wow I’m glad I live in Cali
"<|emo_sad|> I dont mind these people dying, what bothers me is that some random bystander could be smashed by this guy should he fall"
<|emo_joy|> People there are great citizens out there who dislike Rick & Morty studies) should be legalized already.
<|emo_anger|> Fucking Synths. -[NAME]
<|emo_fear|> I hope all my muscles cringe so spastically all my joints come loose and I collapse into a writhing agonized pile of blood and meat.
"<|emo_surprise|> Or a ""what if"" episode where [NAME] and [NAME] didn't die!"
<|emo_sad|> I feel bad for that other little girl that was the only one not to get a puck
"<|emo_anger|> Look I'm not saying that I agree with them, theres no need to be an asshole"
"<|emo_anger|> How original, another “[NAME] hates tutorials” meme..."
"<|emo_fear|> Didn't realize they were shipping the challenge coins with Israeli FAL rifles, that makes this whole thing even weirder."
<|emo_sad|> The thing that screams narc to me is that you still had an 8pm curfew at age 20.
<|emo_sad|> I miss them being alive
<|emo_sad|> Hang on so Im not allowed to stroke your dog? Thats sad.
<|emo_disgust|> I don't see anything about harassment in that statement. Weird.
"<|emo_disgust|> Manipulation. I love my mother btw, but this thing is insidious."
<|emo_anger|> Why are you so fucking concerned with what someone else uses to clean their teeth? You sound like a toothpaste troll.
<|emo_anger|> Yeah that was inexcusable
<|emo_surprise|> sometimes i look up at the stars and i wonder if [NAME] is masterbating to our conversation somewhere out there
<|emo_joy|> This sounds very familiar...
<|emo_surprise|> The level of denial the top boys reached was astonishing.
<|emo_anger|> The bourgeoisie elected courts were going to backtrack on all [NAME] economic reforms. Fuck those guys.
<|emo_anger|> FOOD POISONING BAD BURRITO
<|emo_sad|> Thank you so much. I am sorry for what happened to you.
<|emo_sad|> Must be why I'm alive. That sucks.
<|emo_fear|> I'm paranoid that I might not have all of them. A download would be helpful!
<|emo_anger|> Because people hate freedom
"<|emo_surprise|> You're a [NAME], wizard."
"<|emo_sad|> Oof, that's rough. :( Sorry that happened to you, mate. "
<|emo_fear|> His watch has ended
<|emo_disgust|> The fact that such awful designs exist almost makes me want to stop wearing leggings. *Almost.*
<|emo_disgust|> My son told me he hates me
<|emo_anger|> I thought it was like a fake url sorry
<|emo_disgust|> Also stay hydrated! That was a mistake I was constantly making too
<|emo_disgust|> This can be taken horribly out of context
<|emo_fear|> What a cringeworthy load of kak this is. Wow I have no words.
<|emo_disgust|> Cool. Would be happy to know if this worked out for you. I had wasted a bunch of time like you did and was getting frustrated.
<|emo_sad|> Yeah it’s ridiculous. I mean I’m crying about the model but I still spent the money lol
<|emo_anger|> You realize everyone sees you REEEEEEing all over the place right? You can act nonchalant all you want but obviously youre one salty sea dog
<|emo_anger|> Look I don’t mean to be rude but w
"<|emo_anger|> Please, please, please don't do that to yourself. You'll end feeling worse when this guy leaves you. "
<|emo_joy|> Congratulations fellow lobster!!
"<|emo_anger|> My girlfriend's creepy uncle gets extremely triggered when I point this out, or that a lot of conservatives are gigantic fudds."
<|emo_surprise|> Dude you don't know what I wanted. [NAME] was very clearly a generational talent.
<|emo_anger|> Hey man. A lot of people have criminals in their family. That doesn’t mean they are I think you need to take a step back
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] please don’t come to the USA. We’d love to have you...but you don’t need to deal with this.
"<|emo_sad|> Ok. Progress. Not only I presented more facts, I also asked some questions. Still unanswered, sadly. "
"<|emo_joy|> I need more videos of this cat, love its face xD"
<|emo_sad|> Wish i had more up votes for you.
"<|emo_anger|> And any form of bottom up government is also extremely susceptible to corruption. Basically, humans suck. "
<|emo_sad|> yeah i guess being a sexually unsuccessful giant dweeb is being red pilled
"<|emo_surprise|> > you've absolutely just generically described absolutely everywhere and not just Scotland. Nope, just the difference between scotland and sussex is staggering. "
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME], I hate [NAME]."
<|emo_anger|> Get off my property
"<|emo_joy|> The importance of believing in [NAME] and see, and sticking with them, when you realize they're good things "

<|emo_disgust|> Can't tell if bad troll or just ignorant knowitall
<|emo_surprise|> What I’m hearing is you’re under 15. /r/teenagers is that way
<|emo_anger|> He’s going to the Bengals at 11 and I hate it so much
<|emo_anger|> How many times has this ‘football fan’ committed these crimes now. Someone should lock him up.
<|emo_sad|> all I did was snitch on him
<|emo_surprise|> Omg is this that what older kids call s*x?1?1??1??
<|emo_disgust|> Papaoutai still leaves me bald.
"<|emo_anger|> Ugh, this fucking tumblr account. I posted about this bitch before, they wrote that [NAME] drug rehab fanfiction."
<|emo_disgust|> Who brings a gun to a middle school in the first place? This kid was not right.
"<|emo_anger|> I know you’re out there somewhere Beer Barron, and I’ll find you.... *no you won’t!*"
<|emo_anger|> From my point of view the freefolk are evil
<|emo_anger|> Gawd but [NAME] is a bitch.
<|emo_disgust|> Please. I can’t even with these comments.
<|emo_surprise|> really thought he'd hit a bird for the longest time.
<|emo_anger|> Mother of [NAME]... Im not grossed out very easily. I can stomach just about anything. But this made my fucking skin crawl....
<|emo_disgust|> The shading makes her face look like she has lumps under her skin.
<|emo_sad|> She is probably cheating on you. :(
<|emo_anger|> Hated her. And that was honestly a more offensive reaction than everyone laughing at her IMHO
<|emo_joy|> Please share lol
"<|emo_anger|> I agree, I love acdc, I just don't love the comments on their songs cause so many of them are dumb lmao"
<|emo_sad|> I’m so sorry. You deserve so much better.

<|emo_sad|> Pls not granny :(
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah but scary brown people. Ever thought of that libtard? /s ^just ^^in ^^^case
<|emo_disgust|> This year would’ve been the year to start it... we’ll likely be losing the heart of our team after this season
"<|emo_joy|> Omg I am so grateful for attending your TED Talk. (Not being sarcastic, btw. This is great)"
<|emo_sad|> That's so sad.
<|emo_sad|> Honestly? No. I just feel sad for you guys
<|emo_joy|> I tell myself that but when I’m at 90 I’m like a zombie
<|emo_sad|> I had one of those... my cat broke it.
<|emo_fear|> jeeez i've never seen a scorpion so bad it actually flipped the person up right
<|emo_anger|> Being too scared of calling someone isn’t a disability for fuck sakes... use some common sense and grow up.
<|emo_disgust|> I don't wear panties. You'll need to describe the sensation.
"<|emo_disgust|> Found looking through this, she seems a little bit gross :D"
"<|emo_anger|> Alright dude just fuck off ok, it's not the funniest thing on the internet but it did make me smile so in conclusion fuck you"
<|emo_anger|> “Touch me again and I’ll kill you.” I’m low key blown away that The Last Boy Scout even *made* it to Australia.
<|emo_disgust|> This is the same woman who fought tooth and nail to have wrongful convictions upheld while she was a prosecutor; she craves tyranny.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh god no!!! I was gonna get some shipped out to save you some money. Never mind.
<|emo_joy|> *Hey just noticed..* it's your **5th Cakeday** melodesign! ^(hug)

"<|emo_disgust|> i truly believe compulsive, chronic cheaters are sociopaths. no empathy, compassion, and they're impulsive and manipulative"
<|emo_disgust|> I'm ugly and able to bump uglies with someone I can make laugh. Mission accomplished.
<|emo_anger|> Screaming at this reply
<|emo_fear|> that day humanity received a grim reminder
<|emo_joy|> Gotta love trailing for 59+ minutes
<|emo_anger|> Kotaku never ceases to amaze me with the horrible decisions they make in posting stories that can ruin people's lives with no confirmation or validity.
"<|emo_sad|> Wow, you folks sure are salty about losing the midterms! Pathetic?"
<|emo_sad|> I know I've heard this phrase before but it's driving me crazy not remembering what it's from Please save me from my torment
<|emo_disgust|> Super unflattering. [NAME] is not overweight but this ensemble made her appear chunky.
"<|emo_joy|> Send your story over to r/nice guys, they'll love it "
"<|emo_disgust|> ASMR is a weird sexual fetish for incels, and dont let anyone try and convince you otherwise."
<|emo_fear|> CBA's app is atrocious. I had to set it up on my mother's new iPhone and it was a nightmare.
<|emo_joy|> Haha. Dried fruit is partially how I got fat again.
"<|emo_joy|> I like flirting so this is what I enjoy doing, plus ordinary flirting is outcome independent. Direct approach is outcome dependent. Either way it's all part of the fun!"
<|emo_anger|> Where is that damn SaLt LiCK
"<|emo_anger|> And we play for 6 dollars, this makes me so angry we need a big ass casino in that game"
"<|emo_fear|> Yes, it can be a very stressful read at times."
"<|emo_anger|> OOOOOFFF, now that'd be a kick to the head"
"<|emo_sad|> I wqs explqining my problems and my past to him, sort of venting, and that's when he offered."
<|emo_anger|> This is the worst I've ever seen. It really is
<|emo_anger|> And what a fuckton of karma it was. It’s fake stories like this that really prove that communism is the far superior economic system.
"<|emo_joy|> All. I too, am drunk, and will be enjoying half price burgers at Whitlow's once my appetite kicks in. "
"<|emo_anger|> Yeah suck it, California"
"<|emo_disgust|> It's bad enough to break into a house, but snooping and stealing from a friend?! r/trashy r/iamatotalpieceofshit Hope you have better luck with friends in the future!"
<|emo_fear|> He said this awhile ago. His splits away from coors scares me.
<|emo_joy|> Yeah probably. But the thought of [NAME] and [NAME] installing democracies instead of authoritarian dictatorships is utter nonsense.
<|emo_anger|> The fuck is “mog?!”
"<|emo_joy|> Once I saw who posted the video, I was certain I knew who it was, and I was right. Glad to see him back in action!"
<|emo_fear|> What changed for [NAME]? Last season he had a spurt of being meta and dominant and [NAME] was a bit of a terror
<|emo_sad|> This is a depressing r/tworedditorsonecup
<|emo_joy|> Oh boy you’re in for a treat. Make sure you visit Austin if you move
<|emo_anger|> I can barely remember when it was even possible to find shit that horrible
<|emo_disgust|> Liberals have become the very thing they accuse everyone else of. Being intolerant and racist.
<|emo_anger|> She got the death penalty...? fck me.
"<|emo_fear|> Yeah, I’m at the dh store. so it’s far but not that far. People really are horrible. "
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] is scared out there. Didnt want the ball
<|emo_joy|> Most of them seem to be joking about the walls.
<|emo_fear|> Gl hf team we can do this! :[NAME]: Whole team leaves
<|emo_sad|> I'm so sorry about your friend. What was he like?
<|emo_surprise|> Wow random irrelevant internet person has the secret goods on [NAME]. Maybe we’ll finally get to the bottom of this birth certificate thing...
"<|emo_joy|> that's ace, thank you so much "
<|emo_sad|> Oh dear lord. Imagine if [NAME] scores off the break from a scoring chance of [NAME] and [NAME]
<|emo_disgust|> What kind of response is that it's so shit
"<|emo_joy|> lol... always someone to whine and complain. I guess the other countries on the Top 5 are perfect, eh? "
<|emo_disgust|> Her face looks like a damn frog to me - and the way she has one eye closed; an evil one eyed frog!
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] fucking christ. When [NAME] came into the league he was pretty much as skinny as [NAME] is now. And look at the dude now.
<|emo_disgust|> She was literally the worst manager I’ve ever worked for
<|emo_sad|> I have never had so many heart attacks..
<|emo_surprise|> I would be surprised if [NAME] doesn't let you in. I would write a letter to [NAME] and explain the situation they might make an exception.
<|emo_sad|> This just makes me feel inferior at this point.
<|emo_sad|> You’re probably recalling it correctly! It was maybe 2 years ago? Very ugly & sorted story
<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. You really know your stuff. Luckily I don't have diabetes yet so that's something
<|emo_sad|> that made me feel bad for nw
<|emo_anger|> That's so frustrating but I'm glad you're all safe.
<|emo_anger|> Why you mad bro
<|emo_joy|> Lmao I remember watching that game😭
"<|emo_anger|> Beat me to it. Just because the news makes it seem like there is a pandemic of school shootings, it is exceedingly unlikely to happen."
<|emo_fear|> OH [NAME] THAT'S TERRIFYING SOMEBODY SAVE US ^/s
"<|emo_joy|> Ah so gang rapes aren't a thing anymore, eh? Glad to hear that. "
"<|emo_sad|> oh, what an unlucky woman, that mother of his..."

<|emo_disgust|> I'm so sorry. That's awful.
<|emo_joy|> Ice Cream or Tacos for me. Or the best of both worlds.... a ChocoTaco!
"<|emo_anger|> You finna be nauseous as hell man, Dont stress it though just throw up"
"<|emo_surprise|> It’s irreversible, we’ve started something bigger than we know."
<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid that will leave Britain no better. Can't imagine the ruckus if remain wins.
<|emo_fear|> Yes absolutely extreme levels of anxiety reaching the sheer terror phase tbh. People have no idea what I go through
<|emo_disgust|> Any man who risks having unprotected intercourse with random women likely doesn't have being a father on his mind.
<|emo_anger|> How dare the russian government expose the DNC and its corrupt behavior!!!!!
<|emo_joy|> Bee happy! ' v')
<|emo_disgust|> No the limiting factor is the leader raped a young boy and paid his silence

<|emo_sad|> My heart is breaking for that little girl.

<|emo_anger|> She should not defend herself? Stop blaming both sides.
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah it doesn't impact much except when they break and cause billions of dollars in damages and irreparable consequences to the wildlife.
<|emo_disgust|> Completely miss-wired! I never thought a kid can grow up miss-wired.
<|emo_anger|> This is dumb. Why is Detroit Lions infiltrating here.
<|emo_sad|> Going through the same thing and I feel the same way. Sadness. I hope it'll pass!

"<|emo_sad|> Thanks. I'm still sad till this day. But whatever happens, I'm at peace with his decision."
<|emo_anger|> Hating people for what they've done VS Hating people for their race. Even you have to be able to see the difference.

"<|emo_sad|> Nah it's not that, [NAME] is just boring and sad"

<|emo_sad|> Aaaand everybody got diarrhea. Thanks dummy

"<|emo_joy|> Im sorry I was just trying to help, thank you for educating me ill do better, Happy New year!"
<|emo_joy|> I like the game tonight
"<|emo_anger|> Fuck it, it's every man/woman for themselves in this fucked City. I've given up caring."
<|emo_surprise|> It’s a metaphor. No one cares how big his anatomy is.
<|emo_disgust|> Misogynist! Anti-women! Bigot!
"<|emo_sad|> I think the saddest thing here is that he thinks ""by-my-self"" is how to write that."

"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that crazy. Hope this doesn't happen again with you. Stay safe!"
<|emo_joy|> I like the earthquake that occurs after she falls. Glad the cameraman got that on video.
<|emo_sad|> oh my [NAME]. it was hurting my brain. i only saw the disappearing boot and thought i was missing something.
<|emo_disgust|> What was the original post? If it was as awful as this one my comment would still apply!

"<|emo_sad|> Dam tears in my eyes now, but seriously great job "
<|emo_disgust|> Weird but interesting nonetheless.
<|emo_surprise|> What a goal
"<|emo_surprise|> How about we don't swear on medieval religions at all, thanks"
"<|emo_joy|> Yeah I suppose lol, but either way yours is the best one I've seen so far "

"<|emo_sad|> Yes!! It took 6 months to get my license in! I started to worry that something had gone wrong, but, I indeed receive it!"
<|emo_disgust|> This made me spill my drink.
<|emo_anger|> This was a hate crime. Cut and dried.

<|emo_sad|> I'm sensitive! :'(
<|emo_disgust|> Its distasteful to complain about male-dominated space like stem? **pearl clutching intensifies**
<|emo_sad|> That’s literally the stupidest thing ever If you think that what is stopping it to be applied to more than just bi-sexuality Seems a bit self destructive
<|emo_fear|> That sounds a little paranoid
"<|emo_disgust|> I’m right handed, yet left eye dominant and straight... life is beautifully strange."
<|emo_joy|> That'll be a testical festival for sure. Have fun.
<|emo_fear|> That [NAME] part killed me!
<|emo_joy|> It's one of these situations where I'm happy that I'm not enough of a gimp to understand
<|emo_surprise|> It’s crazy how many people don’t know the difference between fluid ounces and weight lol
<|emo_disgust|> It’s a cruel thing to say to someone with depression.
"<|emo_anger|> Nope, it’s what you said. If 17 isn’t a child then what are they?"
<|emo_disgust|> Awful taste hmmmmm
<|emo_anger|> (*ﾉωﾉ) O-okay senpai OWO *Nuzzles* Frick off I write whatever I want!

<|emo_sad|> Its hard to explain i feel everything is distant.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow you're so moral you've changed my outlook on remainers

<|emo_fear|> The third picture is creepy.
<|emo_anger|> Stupid for difficult. I always feel that way. Fool among elites. That means I can be cared for.

<|emo_joy|> Farewell wonderful traffic. It's been good 2 weeks.
<|emo_anger|> Why was the discrimination and ghettoization of [NAME] prior to their extermination legal? Because legislators sometimes don't care for morality.
<|emo_fear|> Fear - that's it. You need to work on identifying and overcoming your fears.
<|emo_sad|> Until the downvotes roll in and you become glue :(

<|emo_sad|> That's perfectly fine. I'm sorry if I offended you in any way. Have a nice day.
"<|emo_disgust|> This is so crazy pessimistic. A generic [NAME] will win with plenty of room to spare, the problem is that ""generic"" candidates don't exist"

<|emo_disgust|> Also the fishing has been terrible for a month now. I am about to take the 5 story jump my friends.
"<|emo_joy|> You're welcome, eh"
"<|emo_anger|> Bro, pay attention. I know you guys aren't known for that, but this is not a centrist sub. For [NAME] sake read for one"
"<|emo_fear|> This is the most scary [NAME] can ever be to me, cause it’s also the most real he could ever be 😂"
"<|emo_anger|> Yeah, The Donald seems to spread its purging mentality to most right leaning subreddits. Reminds me, I should get banned from r/theDonald again for quoting [NAME]"

<|emo_sad|> Im sorry dude. Drumming Octopuss.
<|emo_anger|> Chipotleee! [NAME] Damitt! Closes in 39 Seconds.. but we made it!! Loved this guy!!
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah, this is always my first thought when I read this kind of stuff, kinda sad to be honest "
<|emo_surprise|> That's really interesting! I've seen that happen before too
<|emo_fear|> Talking about cats my lil Friend just jumped on the couch *pat pat from the nice people of reddit*
<|emo_disgust|> It might be the other way around! They seem to have a lot of awkward conversations while eating dinner.
"<|emo_joy|> I'm glad for that. Once that check comes in, I only have about $3000 to work with."
<|emo_anger|> They laughed in our faces for a decade. Not to mention they were actually cheating (bountygate).
<|emo_joy|> Gotta know a season ticket holder willing to part with one. Did a quick search and found a few for sale.
<|emo_sad|> I just wanted my knees to stop hurting
<|emo_surprise|> It’s crazy how many people don’t know the difference between fluid ounces and weight lol
<|emo_sad|> They were hurt to get that way. Hurt people hurt people
<|emo_disgust|> At SkyZone with the kid getting some energy out. Next up is a dentist visit...ugh
"<|emo_fear|> LOL yes, this guy might not be too bright. "
<|emo_sad|> So sorry to hear about your abnormal growth. I'm now green with envy. Are there other celestial gods that can identify with existence?
"<|emo_anger|> Oh, the show that had [NAME]? Yeah screw him."
<|emo_sad|> I'm the one who died inside here
<|emo_surprise|> Geez those heroes..
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] why can I relate so much.
<|emo_disgust|> I have to use it or else I’ll miscount money 😥😥 the worst feeling is when I use hand sani over it BC IM DISGUSTED W MYSELF
"<|emo_fear|> It's like calling a snake a ""danger noodle"" or a hedgehog an ""ouchy mouse"". It's just like a silly thing"
<|emo_sad|> muh racist history! its all gone! no one will ever know about my slavery and being a traitorous vermin! help meh!
<|emo_joy|> Happy cake day!
"<|emo_fear|> I love Subnautica. It's so, so terrifying but also beautiful and cool and I can wimp out and put it down any time. "
<|emo_surprise|> That escalated quickly.
<|emo_sad|> That fascist bigot!
<|emo_disgust|> To make money from money is disgusting and is screwing up the economy.
<|emo_sad|> On a college campus surrounded by undergrads. I feel old.
<|emo_anger|> fuck atheist countries
"<|emo_surprise|> Wait, wut? I thought there was some sort of (2) term pledge from"
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] stopped napping at 18 months. We’ve been implementing quiet time since. It’s wondrous.
"<|emo_surprise|> ""paid text messages"" And what an odd assortment of districts, most of these I'd categorize as Lean D to start."
<|emo_anger|> What the fuck Edit: YOOOO I SWEAR MY DOOKU JUST SAID ONE OF HIS EMOTES IN A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE
<|emo_disgust|> yuck no I'm waiting until marriage obvs
"<|emo_surprise|> Huh, never heard of that term before. Something new every day!"
<|emo_fear|> If it was Central Transport you might of got lucky. Sometimes I wonder if they even hve doors on the trailers things go missing an awful lot
"<|emo_fear|> Sadly, I don't have insurance so unless I'm bleeding out I won't be getting medical help."
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] just ripped his jersey. He’s frustrated as hell right now
<|emo_disgust|> It's the worst when it's something you are passionate about
<|emo_anger|> just say whore.
"<|emo_sad|> Oof, what a bad and dated meme"
"<|emo_fear|> That does suck. I’m sorry. Having recently been ghosted by someone who I thought was a very close friend, it’s a terrible feeling"
<|emo_joy|> And he's showing off those tiny little hands
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] stopped napping at 18 months. We’ve been implementing quiet time since. It’s wondrous.
<|emo_joy|> It's not that bad. Not even the employees were cringe worthy. I'm glad that they were all enthused about having fun with the seniors.
"<|emo_disgust|> As horrible as it is to say, evidently the voting population doesn't care enough to make a large impact. "
<|emo_sad|> Can’t blame him! She kinda looks like [NAME] long lost older sister.
<|emo_joy|> Um....Yes? I would love it if everyone didn't believe in [NAME].
"<|emo_fear|> The constant pressure definitely isn't helping. I'm already on anti-depressants, but I am terrified of PPD."
"<|emo_disgust|> you forgot miracle, fake fan"
<|emo_anger|> That sounds frustrating!
<|emo_sad|> I grew up in the upper peninsula of Michigan so I love the ShopKo reference because those stores are usually in places with depressed economies.
<|emo_anger|> It developed because of my childhood and robbed me of a good bit of good stuff as an adult.
"<|emo_disgust|> Australia? Edit: No, [NAME], but awfully similar to the situation here in Australia."
<|emo_disgust|> Females would be pressured the other way obviously
"<|emo_fear|> Given it looks like a cotton field, it feels a bit more sinister than that. "
<|emo_sad|> Its all good until that episode where [NAME] traps the bat on [NAME] head comes on and she screams bloody murder and wakes us up.
<|emo_sad|> This is so cruel. I literally feel physically sick.
<|emo_joy|> I may have got lung cancer and hiv but at least I was around when [NAME] was haha baby-boomer win!
"<|emo_joy|> glad to see youtubes ""family friendly"" robots have their priorities straight. "
<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry man sounds bad
<|emo_sad|> We have seven fucking billion and more people bork every day !!
<|emo_joy|> I’m glad to see [NAME] finally get the big screen presence they deserve.
<|emo_disgust|> What an awful last 10 minutes. Can't even make one pass to someone.
<|emo_surprise|> That’s crazy
<|emo_sad|> Don’t let the bastards grind you down. I’m so sorry for this experience. No one deserves to be treated that way.
<|emo_joy|> It was a screech of delight. I like this hire. Would let to get a good OC now.
"<|emo_anger|> Can confirm, playing a game of checkers is the one occasion I get to smash my wife"
<|emo_surprise|> Wow that's not how you resolve things. Escalation is the last option.
<|emo_anger|> I hated that smug ass lawyer.
"<|emo_surprise|> If she is sorry at all. Could be more along the lines of ""I am pretending to be sorry so I don't get fired."""
<|emo_fear|> Waterspouts might be one of nature’s most beautiful dangerous things
<|emo_surprise|> How she used the entire video without any editing.... that’s copyright
<|emo_surprise|> They’re looking sharp!!
<|emo_anger|> That comparison system could backfire when hogs see their 83rd percentile healing and go “what the fuck were our healers doing I have 83rd percentile healing”
<|emo_anger|> I've seen AOCs ridiculous proposals
"<|emo_sad|> And [NAME], would again like to apologize for any misunderstanding."
"<|emo_joy|> When someone is that crazy, it's probably best to deescalate and go about your day rather than risk them doing something truly crazy. "
<|emo_anger|> Sometimes I wonder if people are that stupid or that malicious
<|emo_joy|> I am glad the media got everyone all riled up before this information came out.
<|emo_anger|> Classic sloth fuckboi
<|emo_joy|> > ftw Awesome statistic. Made my day! Love it
"<|emo_fear|> As someone with sinus and breathing problems, this makes me anxious and short of breath just looking at it."
<|emo_surprise|> I always wondered why that never happened with the “muscles from Brussels” in any of his movies.
"<|emo_sad|> :o I have one too! I didn't get anything but bullied at school, though."
<|emo_sad|> Sorry don’t follow you.
<|emo_sad|> Really feeling you today.
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh my, liberals have been busy haven’t they?"
<|emo_surprise|> Wooah :o Didn't know [NAME] had a son xD
<|emo_sad|> I am pleased to report that my 5 win streak was broken.
<|emo_anger|> Are you being stupid again?
<|emo_surprise|> WHAT A TWIST!!
<|emo_surprise|> The username seems like a dead giveaway.
"<|emo_joy|> I'd love [NAME], boy can shoot"
<|emo_disgust|> Oh noooo. I once accidentally rubbed my eye after handling habaneros. It's the worst.
<|emo_disgust|> I assume you mean how men are guilty until proven innocent in rape cases and how many places refuse to accept women can commit rape
<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Some people are so stupid. But if it was me I would have opened the door and at least put it inside the doorway.
<|emo_anger|> Kill it with fire.
"<|emo_anger|> its oxford, if you dont agree with oxford go live in a damn cave, because they is correct, and [NAME] I LOVE ENGLAND"

<|emo_disgust|> This makes me want to die
<|emo_joy|> Ahhh. A civil and interesting conversation on the internet. How refreshing.
"<|emo_disgust|> Why are you making questionable jokes at work? Unless you work in a comedy club, it really aint the place."
<|emo_sad|> Need to go middle of the road no [NAME] is going to vote for [NAME].
"<|emo_joy|> If this team could make there wide open shots, we could win some games. Its unbelievable how many open shots we miss. "
<|emo_fear|> Please elaborate on that story! Ive always been afraid of exactly this happening to me.
"<|emo_sad|> I thought that said affordable, and i was really concerned"
<|emo_disgust|> These were one of the worst commentators I have ever been forced to listen to. The jokes were so cringe-worthy.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that crazy. Hope this doesn't happen again with you. Stay safe!"
<|emo_joy|> Happy birthday [NAME]!
"<|emo_surprise|> I CANT BELIEVE HER WIG STAYED ON WITH ALL THAT CAKE!!!! [NAME] tape really does hold back all, y'all. Alaska who?"
<|emo_anger|> Well that sucks lmao
"<|emo_anger|> You will watch porn again, don't try to fool me"
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, [NAME] "
<|emo_anger|> Someone who evidently doesn’t really know much about football or doesn’t do a simple google search before posting.
"<|emo_disgust|> That sucks Crescent City, I hope you get the guys.... "
<|emo_sad|> Holy shit! Did not see that coming! Gonna miss you [NAME] :(
<|emo_anger|> What the actual fuck?
"<|emo_sad|> sadly it would take wayyyyyy more than this to ever change custody agreements. documenting it for her own sanity is a good idea, though."
<|emo_anger|> That happens and is his own fault. Glad he's gone and Juve have [NAME] now.
<|emo_joy|> thats amazing!! Congrats!
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad you have someone to help you out! Perhaps over time you'll find it easier.
<|emo_disgust|> I’ve lived in Florida. Hurricanes are *much* worse.
<|emo_joy|> I'm a Bioware fanboy so obviously biased. I even enjoyed Andromeda. Haha.
"<|emo_sad|> You know I never thought I'd celebrate someone's death, but once she goes I'm going to have to try very hard to not enjoy it..."
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] damn it, I knew something was wrong, oh well."
<|emo_anger|> THANK YOU [NAME]
"<|emo_disgust|> Because bullying is a way to enforce social conformity, and discourage people from being different. "
<|emo_anger|> To bad your mother didn’t swallow your dumbass
"<|emo_surprise|> Omg, the kitty bites the knee and then looks at the human to gauge reaction."
<|emo_sad|> It's kinda sad knowing that ibises are only scavenging our bins & rubbish due to their natural habitats drying out.
<|emo_disgust|> To me the toenails is the grossest part! 🤮
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, foot and car traffic downtown has changed a ton in just 8 years. "
<|emo_anger|> Literally right after I sent it. What the hell
"<|emo_joy|> Little kids are the best because they're just like ""Wtf?!?!?"""""
<|emo_surprise|> I never knew cringing could be so ...cathartic.
<|emo_surprise|> People really spend more than $10 in an app game? I mean an actual video game I can understand but that's just...sad
<|emo_surprise|> Omg this is great.
<|emo_joy|> *Hey just noticed..* it's your **5th Cakeday** gum_sticks! ^(hug)
<|emo_anger|> We are atrocious on defence.. I hate this tactics of defenders playing th ball around.. slows down the creativity so much
<|emo_surprise|> I'm actually surprised it stayed up. We already got a shitpost thread yesterday. I though the limit was one per week.
"<|emo_disgust|> Ugh YES. I literally am so against it and everyone is always like ""why it's fun"" but like I just want to find love "
"<|emo_anger|> Everything mentioned below, plus when [NAME] dicey Walmart convict boyfriend changed [NAME] diaper. [NAME] found out and went ballistic, and rightfully so."
<|emo_sad|> It’s kinda sad that this made me lol.
<|emo_sad|> Lots of people suck on the show but [NAME] is the only one who sucks in real life.

"<|emo_disgust|> I didn't like this, not for even one second. "
<|emo_joy|> I’m glad not too much time was put into this
<|emo_fear|> It was skeletor!!! Beast man was dunk
<|emo_sad|> Wow what a disappointing game. Wish we would have showed up
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] out? I thought he’s been playing pretty well. Wonder why...
<|emo_surprise|> Oh interesting username
"<|emo_anger|> I'm with you, pulju has been looking dangerous lately"
<|emo_disgust|> That seems crazy that you can't hit higher frame rates. I can hit 80fps consistent with a 1080. Something weird is going on here.
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] was the [NAME] of the [NAME] years. Didn't realise he was still about.
"<|emo_surprise|> Frankly, partisan politics aside, I would REALLY like to know where this fever dream of historical came from. It's mind boggling."
<|emo_joy|> Oh la la
<|emo_anger|> If somebody is fundamentally unsocialized chances are they behave socially inappropriate in more than one situation
<|emo_sad|> Very sad news for the man. Widespread travel disruption is expected for the evening commute
<|emo_anger|> I cant believe we elected this goon
<|emo_sad|> Word. I have 0 of these in my life. I miss my INTJ ex brother-in-law haha.
"<|emo_disgust|> Wow that’s scary, she’s so young and healthy. I hate that. "
<|emo_joy|> Not any meaningful amount as far as I can tell. Although I’d love to be surprised
<|emo_surprise|> *Poop hole* Oooohwee!
<|emo_sad|> Keeping the stomach warm also helps. Holding the baby with their stomach against yours helps them fall asleep. But it doesn't work all the time unfortunately.
<|emo_sad|> I’ve been hurt too many times for it all to have been for nothing
"<|emo_disgust|> It's like [NAME] said, man. You look for the guy that benefits, and uh... You know, uh..."
<|emo_surprise|> I'm sorry I imagine that was devastating.
"<|emo_disgust|> Basic translation ""I'd rape you if I weren't a virgin!"" Super creepy."
<|emo_surprise|> I cringe at every part of all of this
<|emo_joy|> Glad she reads the comments of every [NAME] Facebook post ever
"<|emo_sad|> Totally forgot that, my bad"
<|emo_anger|> My coffee burned its way through my nostrils. Thank you!
<|emo_anger|> You’re the coward! I was the second man to walk on the moon. NEIL BEFORE ME.
<|emo_sad|> Sodaman going sicko mode
<|emo_anger|> Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal!
<|emo_disgust|> We're going to return to [NAME] and [NAME] being bffs again and talking shit about [NAME] or some other random shit.
"<|emo_joy|> This is actually funny OP, stop trying to be so negative"
"<|emo_disgust|> I still think [NAME] is better, [NAME] normal are really bad... "
<|emo_joy|> I switched to Ally and love it. 2.2% interest is awesome
<|emo_fear|> That was a terrible pass regardless. Wasn’t close
<|emo_joy|> Reminds me of this stunt [NAME] pulled a few years ago in
<|emo_joy|> I'd love an updated Garris!
<|emo_anger|> I'm so fucking dead!!!!!!!💀💀💀💀🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] looking like his fucking controller disconnected
<|emo_sad|> You look like a failed attempt to gene splice [NAME] and [NAME] DNA
"<|emo_sad|> :o I have one too! I didn't get anything but bullied at school, though."
<|emo_disgust|> I'd rather die than drive a Volvo!
<|emo_anger|> It's not Russian land either. Your argument is still complete nonsense.
"<|emo_anger|>  anyone who hasn't seen this, it's unbelievably bad."
"<|emo_anger|> I figured this story would end with her screaming, ""I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE... THIS IS A CAR.. TAKE ME HOME!!!"""
"<|emo_joy|> I actually realize this today. Woke up, swept the floor and the bathroom, have being amazing all day long."
<|emo_fear|> No worries. Just giving you a hard time!
<|emo_sad|> #QUIT HURTING THE BIRDS
<|emo_anger|> 3 Hours of [NAME] pissing on the floor in public
"<|emo_sad|> I'm always stuck in platinum because every match is a loss, no healer what so ever"
<|emo_joy|> In Rainbow is super amazing album as well.
<|emo_surprise|> The altcoin thread!? This is the first time I've seen it in 6 months.
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] people. Just vaccinate your overgrown sperm cells and people won't have to die.
<|emo_disgust|> This is child abuse. No decent parent would force their kid to starve just because they don't understand science and nutrition
"<|emo_disgust|> Clearly, he had a bad Wednesday practice…"
<|emo_joy|> Cheers for the reply ;)
<|emo_joy|> It actually makes me really happy when people literally call me [NAME]. Thanks kind stranger!
"<|emo_sad|> Nah, substance abuse is sad, period. "
"<|emo_joy|> Been to 54 countries at age 34. No debts, ever. Aiming for retirement in my early 40's. Life is good."
<|emo_surprise|> How do you know he likes beer. Did he ever once state that he likes beer?
"<|emo_anger|> I've said it before, but yuck, kissing that bloody mouth... Watch out, [NAME], you don't know where that's been."
"<|emo_sad|> Nah, substance abuse is sad, period. "
<|emo_sad|> It was extremely sad ... because you can tell the reason why [NAME] is the way he is.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you must've never been on /pol/ or like dozens of anti [NAME] subreddits."
<|emo_joy|> Yep. Happy New Years!
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] said Monday was Columbus Day and those two bought it. Unbelievable.
<|emo_anger|> Get the hell out of here with that fiscal sensibility and care for other human beings!
"<|emo_disgust|> This picture is a prime example that [NAME] are intolerant douchebags who will always demonize wealth, fame, and entertainment."
<|emo_sad|> i’m sorry i don’t have the box with me
<|emo_joy|> By that logic its seedy and insincere for google to act like they care about Homealone.
"<|emo_anger|> Then there you have it. From everything I have seen thus far, this game is doomed. I hate saying that."
"<|emo_surprise|> That's still a fucking insane number. 70% is goddamn insanity, and the only reason you're alright with it is because you're unaffected."
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] I HATE those.
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] can’t space and [NAME] is getting worse defensively
<|emo_sad|> Now that's screwed up. I'm sorry you got put through that :( good on you though for handling it like you did
<|emo_surprise|> I'm amazed people read BuzzFeed articles.
"<|emo_fear|> Im not a brexiter. In fact, this is my concern with a second referendum. I'm worried that remain will lose."
"<|emo_joy|> Very happy to hear that. I hope he keeps at it, and is open and honest with them."
"<|emo_joy|> Omg this is awesome. What a witch, I’m so glad they escorted her out. "
<|emo_disgust|> internally down-voting for the sarcasm!
"<|emo_anger|> That face screams ""Fucking gods, do I have to do *everything* around here?"""
<|emo_joy|> I like how the Red Tie Legion chose a picture where he’s tieless for their shitty-ass meme.
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] spam them till they bleed out.
<|emo_sad|> Being a [NAME] is no different from being a [NAME]. Both have caused genocides. I hate how our society only focuses on one though!
<|emo_anger|> Why don’t you just *get the fuck out* of Edmonton if you hate it so much?
<|emo_anger|> Some idiot talks shit to one woman - > SOCIETY shames WOMEN for BEING ALIVE
<|emo_disgust|> Cant you just feel the unconditional love <3
<|emo_sad|> I wish I could forget. Stop reminding me :(
"<|emo_surprise|> I was pleasantly surprised that I couldn’t think of anything I broke at my last retail job but... you’re right, that was it"
<|emo_sad|> Sorry if this is ignorant but is that a wig?
"<|emo_anger|> I follow that account in tumblr, it’s satire. It’s basically what an incel criclejerk of one person would be."
<|emo_anger|> So can relate. Hot to the point I hated feeling good because it wouldn't last. Might as well enjoy the moment!
<|emo_surprise|> Oh for sure. Sometimes I wonder if they are actually harming there cause with the over the top hypocrisy the newcomers seem to see it quite quickly.
<|emo_anger|> That fucking Mills charge is FUCKING BULLSHIT
"<|emo_sad|> I know you can’t read this, but I feel really bad and hope you learn to read soon "
<|emo_anger|> What. The. Actual. Fuck. *Gags*
"<|emo_sad|> I might be missing a joke myself, but woosh."
<|emo_joy|> Remember when he first got the ball this season and nobody cheered or knew him? Oh how times have changed.
"<|emo_anger|> I hate it when the suits call our oncology program a ""service line"""
"<|emo_anger|> We've been linking that dodgy-as-hell Ukrainian site for years, so go nuts."
<|emo_sad|> You're right to be nervous. That happened near my college's campus when I was a student. She lost everything in her wallet.
<|emo_fear|> I’m worried about [NAME] too
"<|emo_joy|> Congrats! That could not have been an easy step to take, so I'm so happy it's been a positive experience."
"<|emo_joy|> Happiest of birthdays, hope you can share it with the ones you love "
"<|emo_anger|> Enough already. I'm sorry that the breakup is going to be painful, but you can do much better. "
"<|emo_fear|> I never read it, but I sure remember being creeped out by this claymation version"
<|emo_anger|> Fuck you my fortnite k/d is better bitch
<|emo_joy|> I'm 33 and every year I'm more sure I never want children. I am perfectly happy with my husband and our cats. ❤️
<|emo_fear|> This is exactly what I told him. I went the fuck off. Lol
<|emo_disgust|> I highly doubt they would do that in CA. That would put prices at 36$/pack and no one is going to pay 9$/pod.
<|emo_anger|> It’s a Shitpost. 😐 Also. Don’t tell me to shut up. You’re not my mom!... or... are you?
<|emo_joy|> cool cool...
<|emo_anger|> These leaks are actually very credible. It's sad that you guys let Hate and anger blind you from enjoying the experience.
<|emo_sad|> Oi he got stabbed in the eye
"<|emo_sad|> They usually do hoss, hence the steak and beer hard to be sad with good food. "
"<|emo_joy|> Happy that you're happy, and good to see someone highlighting the good parts! Any particular streaming service you're looking to get? :D"
<|emo_sad|> I miss big daddy buff
<|emo_fear|> -30??? Omg that's awful. Stay warm and sane
<|emo_joy|> Glad he didn’t try to backpedal about his feelings. They are valid and he has a right to have them.
<|emo_disgust|> Tkachuk - Pageau - Stone is going to be our second line. Absolutely filthy.
<|emo_disgust|> Lol I hate this too!
"<|emo_sad|> If your greed kills 2 people, it's worse than your murder killing 1. I don't know how this is hard for you to understand. "
<|emo_anger|> At least a feed of diazies stops me shitting the bed over the idea of a man wearing a dress. Uppa fuckin erps!!!
"<|emo_disgust|> Morocco sucks, I don’t blame you for not wanting to go"
<|emo_joy|> you seem fun!
<|emo_anger|> Imagine thinking that a rapist isn't deserving of prison. He's not even sorry.
<|emo_joy|> oh cool! Must be tiring for [NAME] though. Looking forward to watching them!
<|emo_anger|> You realize everyone sees you REEEEEEing all over the place right? You can act nonchalant all you want but obviously youre one salty sea dog
<|emo_sad|> I miss wally he was so likeable
<|emo_joy|> He got It from his moma
<|emo_sad|> My husband and I have been circling the drain for years. :(
<|emo_fear|> Not really. It's just that things you would do in Street Fighter to win are monumentally more difficult if you try to do them in MK.
<|emo_anger|> Yeah I don’t think [NAME] wants you to fuck my wife/his girlfriend anymore you cuck
"<|emo_surprise|> Same here, she left the house we bought and is giving me till the end of the month. Woooo"
<|emo_anger|> Same. About as Libertarian as fucking [NAME].
<|emo_surprise|> So glad to hear they got banned. Can't believe adults can still behave like that.
<|emo_joy|> If you like that I got one that you may like. makes me laugh everytime here
<|emo_joy|> Iq designed by the military to see who would be the best pencil pusher subordinates
<|emo_sad|> sad that the Euphoric tipbot is no more
"<|emo_anger|> Yeah, clear off. And tell your mates you had a horrible time too. "
<|emo_sad|> Definitely not. It would be so boring to have no chance year after year.
<|emo_anger|> I would watch that so hard. But I'm sure what's left of LuLaRoe and other MLMs will do whatever they can to stop it.
<|emo_disgust|> i agree he is pretty average but the guy i was responding him was calling him ugly which i find pretty ridiculous
"<|emo_disgust|> Dude got his helmet off and was on his feet quicker than the camera guy could catch his reaction, adrenaline and shock are a hell of a drug.."
"<|emo_fear|> >Some ~~drugs~~ people are just... Scary... Some drugs tend to bring out what's bubbling under the surface, so in that way, yeah. "
<|emo_joy|> Ive never been happier and wouldnt want to live any other way
"<|emo_anger|> I review you - *clap clap* - [NAME], bye bitch, gone"
<|emo_anger|> Sexual frustration.
<|emo_fear|> I have but I sugar discreetly and I’m genuinely afraid to have that compromised due to the field I’m in
<|emo_anger|> Shut up and stop trolling. You're not funny
"<|emo_surprise|> Ironic. He could save others from secrecy-enabled corruption, but not himself."
"<|emo_joy|> I enjoyed hardcore mode much, much more than regular mode in BF4. More realistic"
<|emo_anger|> Oh fucking come on
"<|emo_sad|> I never understood the part where he dives into a pile of money, even as a child. It seems wildly painful."
"<|emo_disgust|> I want to say I'm shocked. I'm not. Disgusted, but not shocked."
"<|emo_sad|> The reaction is incredible. I’m quite certain it’s satire as well, but its impact is depressing as hell. "
<|emo_joy|> I suggest going to the food carts. Buy some legal weed. Enjoy the bars. Go to Washington Park.
"<|emo_fear|> From ""woohoo!!"" to blood curdling screams in a matter of seconds."
<|emo_joy|> 2 is less user friendly but it can be fun. As long as you turn chat off. And hate yourself already.
<|emo_joy|> I joined a club and that's how I made friends. Try joining a club.
"<|emo_joy|> It's finally official, we got [NAME] "
<|emo_anger|> “How dare you use your breasts for their biological function instead of my enjoyment!”
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh man, I didn't know that. No wonder he has no care for it. Does he have any post secondary education?"
<|emo_anger|> #I HATE BOTH EQUALLY
"<|emo_joy|> SS: Collapse of the west, and re-birth, all in a beautiful video."
"<|emo_sad|> It absolutely is. Sadly, most players seem to only want [NAME] with different aesthetics."
<|emo_disgust|> Go away [NAME]....
<|emo_anger|> Really? Cuz hella 18 year olds with bad grades from my high school seemed to do it with ease.
"<|emo_joy|> This made me laugh until i tried to ""like"" the post. Dammit. I am the old people on the Facebook. Shit."
<|emo_joy|> I'm here again to say I love your art and it brings me joy when you post it on this sub bye!
"<|emo_anger|> see, i'm over here thinking ""i hate sports"" now if you could just take my balls and go home"
<|emo_surprise|> I'm so surprised they haven't done it yet tbh!
<|emo_sad|> My earliest memory is being in a wooden crib and my mom screaming in my face at the top of her lungs. It didnt end there.
"<|emo_joy|> Love it! It’s somewhat realistic. Maybe not that THAT degree, but I enjoyed it."
"<|emo_disgust|> thats the future right there, robots trying to help but destroying your whole home in the process. "
"<|emo_anger|> was i replying to you, you fucking degenerate? off yourself ( in game ofc )"
<|emo_surprise|> honestly surprised i havent lost power
"<|emo_joy|> Happy cake day, just in case"
"<|emo_anger|> An ex-friend of mine proclaimed than anyone who speaks of being raped is a horrible, unethical human being."
"<|emo_fear|> You're analogies are terrible and prove the opposite of what you were arguing, numb skull 😂"
"<|emo_disgust|> That's just....sorry, but stupid is the only correct word."
<|emo_sad|> That is so beautiful. It makes my heart hurt that humans can be cruel to animals when they're aware of having so much emotion.
"<|emo_anger|> The Right: ""Why won't the left let us rape, abuse and brainwash children without putting their liberal noses where they don't belong."""
<|emo_surprise|> ROFL! Just about! Didn’t know someone’s eyes could bug out of their head like that outside of cartoons. ;-)
<|emo_surprise|> Haha. 🤔
<|emo_anger|> I do hate fortnite dances
"<|emo_anger|> The sun in his eyes makes him look pissed, like he and the ducks had some personal history."
<|emo_disgust|> She’s a disgusting snob.. Feel bad for the workers. :(
<|emo_anger|> Just do the steps and stop complaining.
<|emo_joy|> At least she had a great experience
"<|emo_anger|> shut up, [NAME]!"
<|emo_surprise|> I still can't believe [NAME] actually gonna be in Smash.
"<|emo_anger|> It's okay. One day you won't be so sad and angry, and people will still accept you."
<|emo_anger|> i feel like slapping /s after everything sucks the fun out. it's not my fault people are autistic.... /s
<|emo_surprise|> Couldn't have said it better. Just did the same over my winter break and really got to know myself a lot better. Cheers to the new year!
<|emo_joy|> Happy cake day!!!!!!!!!🍰🍰
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]? Rape? I am shocked I tell you! SHOCKED!
<|emo_surprise|> Very curious why there is no other competition in this market space
<|emo_surprise|> Was just wondering about the mobile thing. I only use mobile and I've never noticed anything odd. It's not something people would care about anyhow.
<|emo_disgust|> I've eaten some really strange stuff and the only reason to eat this is to see if it is gross.
<|emo_joy|> Have you ever tried to give her lessons in cooking? It could be fun and a bonding for you both.
"<|emo_surprise|> You spend time in The Donald, do you not understand irony?"
<|emo_anger|> I dont believe you
<|emo_fear|> Omg creepy!
"<|emo_joy|> Glad you enjoyed man, yeah it was pretty spontaneous too, I was praying I wasnt about to pull some bartard move and get jammed lol."
<|emo_sad|> I'm sure you weren't alive and I don't recall ever specifically accusing you of doing so.
<|emo_joy|> Lucky bastard the cool change came 5 minutes into the wedding
<|emo_anger|> Shut up nerd
"<|emo_anger|> Everyone go home, the ~woke~ crowd have decreed misogyny and homophobia are a myth. "
"<|emo_anger|> Ah man, I’ve downvoted it now. OP you suck"
<|emo_joy|> What a nasty goal! Gives you chills!
<|emo_fear|> I'd say that the vast majority of the population is and was rightly looked on as horrific. Christmas music makes me feel like a real [NAME].
<|emo_disgust|> I take my girlfriends words literally and she gets fucking pissed.
<|emo_sad|> we are scared on /r/bengals rn
"<|emo_disgust|> Hurts donuts are dry. i love the toppings and suffer through the bottom 90% of the donut, really not worth it. "
<|emo_sad|> Thank you for sharing this. May your friend rest easy and you find peace.
<|emo_anger|> What the fuck Edit: YOOOO I SWEAR MY DOOKU JUST SAID ONE OF HIS EMOTES IN A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE
"<|emo_surprise|> Ladies and gents, I present to you, your typical anti-gunner."
<|emo_sad|> No I’m just following your logic. To avoid pain people should die. Life is pain so people in pain should die. It’s your exact logic
<|emo_disgust|> Exactly why my money goes to more guns and ammo.
"<|emo_sad|> I'm so sad for you, I'm so so sorry. 💔"
"<|emo_disgust|> So, I saw the video yesterday. I think there are real complaints by residents, but that video isn't normal, and absolutely crosses into antisemitism."
<|emo_disgust|> It's on here daily. Karma whores eh?
<|emo_joy|> I was my father's 4th girl. **Nothing** made him uncomfortable by that point
"<|emo_joy|> Welcome back, [NAME]"
"<|emo_joy|> It was once was mine too. Im starting to use it again. :) It is so fucking beautiful,"
<|emo_anger|> Don't be a [NAME] and misuse this term. We've reserved it for a movement of women who are done with sexual harassment.
"<|emo_disgust|> Weirdly enough Salad Fingers is one of [NAME] weaker animations, highly recommend ‘The Unfixable Thought Machine’"
<|emo_fear|> Scared? A little bit. It's more of a simmering disgust at this point for myself.
<|emo_disgust|> That’s a horrible take.
<|emo_sad|> Me me big sad.
<|emo_joy|> Happy birthday!
<|emo_joy|> The day I die is the day I'm happy
<|emo_anger|> So much fake news.
"<|emo_anger|> > But my god, that fucking face. Never mind her, what about him further down."
<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe you won!
<|emo_joy|> That all-star who won the calder
<|emo_sad|> That's just reckless. He's lucky he didn't get permanently disfigured or killed.
"<|emo_anger|> Serious on the vacation time, I haven't seen some government workers doing anything for weeks now!"
<|emo_sad|> Hard to swallow pills. This sub is meh now
"<|emo_anger|> I had a friend send me a 3+ hour paranoid conspiracy documentary, zeitgeist I think it was called... Wasted 10 minutes before I noped the fuck out.."
<|emo_sad|> I am! And I have no idea! Lol sorry. I have some of my own and I couldn't even name them to you.
<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry but as someone who travels alone I would be pissed if I was told I can't drink at the bar by myself.
"<|emo_disgust|> It's pretty stupid honestly. [NAME] clearly pointed a bug and people are saying ""oh, it's a feature"". ...seriously now."
<|emo_sad|> Being born in north america is a curse my friend. Oregon (my home) is kind of like Ireland weather wise though I hear.
<|emo_anger|> Technically it’s the abdomen. Stomach and belly are just informal synonyms. That girl is a racist and an idiot.
<|emo_disgust|> That is even worse. No tax from them and we provide them with services.
"<|emo_sad|> No, they couldn’t hav- They shouldn’t have. uh...this makes me feel sick 🤕 "
<|emo_anger|> Rape kit test from six year old migrant girl revealed DNA from 30 men.
"<|emo_joy|> Ohhh lol, gross and funny"
"<|emo_surprise|> This show has completely gone downhill, can’t believe I waited a month to be disappointed smh"
"<|emo_surprise|> People are still playing bf1?Wow thats nice,I should play some games until more content drops for bf5."
"<|emo_joy|> She does it again in last nights episode, it’s so shady!!"
<|emo_joy|> I enjoyed the 1:50 seconds of this person going about their day uneventfully
<|emo_anger|> How aren’t you in fucking school
"<|emo_disgust|> My cat just attacked me for treats and scratched me on the finger. If this affects my typing, he's in so much trouble."
<|emo_joy|> Woot! Happy New Year!
<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry to hear about what your sister did to you. I'm glad my videos could be of help!
<|emo_disgust|> Oh my [NAME]. The hand mixer instead of forks. Shredding poultry is like my least favorite thing on Earth
"<|emo_disgust|> Shit like this is just depressing. Not surprising, but still depressing."
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] thats real? I'm so glad i unsubbed from pics
<|emo_sad|> I told you I'm not in the mood for a snog tonight!
"<|emo_fear|> Either way, I am afraid his marriage is over. She doesn't respect him anymore..."
"<|emo_joy|> Hey, it's good of you to do this, she may be sad but in the end it will be better for her. Proud of you!"
"<|emo_joy|> Bring it on, I’ve played enough PUBG for a good pan battle!"
<|emo_sad|> you never wanna hear that but sadly people will say they love you when what they really mean is you are convenient.
<|emo_anger|> Motherfucker!!
<|emo_disgust|> FUCKING READ IDIOT
<|emo_disgust|> I don't think either of them took that bump outside any worse than the other. That was jarring.
"<|emo_disgust|> The finest example of an egotistical, ignorant and racist piece of trash. Humans like this disgust me."
<|emo_anger|> It's racist.
<|emo_anger|> School Board Trustees are leeches of the system in any district. It's the most unnecessary position that does nothing more than continuous damage.
<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst take I have ever heard on cooking ever.
<|emo_disgust|> I had to put Bird Box because it's the only direct to streaming movie I saw. I feel dirty.
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah we're just awful. Sadly that's too friggin' true just now!
<|emo_anger|> The sea was angry that day my friends...
"<|emo_sad|> I thought it was something about the dog not smelling your drugs, but now i'm just sad that you didn't get to pet it :("
<|emo_disgust|> Isnt that the god awful truth
<|emo_sad|> I see you utilized it. 3.5? Sad.
"<|emo_disgust|> It has little to do with experience, to be human is to err. "
"<|emo_sad|> forget new buildings, i work at the chase plaza building and am a little bummed that seagram tower made it but this didnt."
<|emo_anger|> Shhh don't give them the idea!
"<|emo_disgust|> Nah, they're a fraction as immature and petulant as the politician we can't ignore that actually affects our lives."
<|emo_disgust|> The least offensive example of anyone I've seen telling me to go fuck myself.
"<|emo_sad|> I'd say we are a role sub at best, sorry guys just telling the truth"
<|emo_disgust|> Seriously Creepy.
"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I haven't felt anything in days. It's like I'm numb, I hate that feeling."
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad the republican won cause I want the best high I have had 5 back surgeries and need another.
<|emo_joy|> You too. Glad to hear your respectful voice again
"<|emo_anger|> He’s such a little bitch, impossible to like"
<|emo_disgust|> You're too ugly to even bully
<|emo_sad|> Or perhaps we should look at the bigger problem: mental healthcare in the United States.
<|emo_sad|> I once looked at the I-95 and was hospitalised for weeks.
<|emo_anger|> How the hell do you get downvoted for a submission statement on /r/TrueReddit. Title or not it is still required.
<|emo_disgust|> They will most likely be branded as PKK symphatizers by Turkish media. Which sucks because next time something like this happens some of them might get shot
"<|emo_sad|> I was too legit. Too legit to quit. Now I’m not legit. I’m un-legit. And therefore, I must quit."
"<|emo_joy|> Thanks man, I will have to check it out!"
<|emo_fear|> Horrible night for dodo
<|emo_anger|> This man makes aggressive grunts while breathing
<|emo_anger|> See the other one has advertising that hides the fucking stupid [NAME] that's the difference!
"<|emo_disgust|> Not only do they make me cringe, I become angry because usually or is my nmother and her flying monkey daughter posting them. Just horrible."
<|emo_sad|> This hurts me
"<|emo_disgust|> The only thing worse than this guy, is an actual vegan lecturing random strangers on why meat is murder. "
"<|emo_surprise|> It's amazing how utterly lacking in self-awareness this sub is, that it can upvote this without a hint of irony."
"<|emo_joy|> I just read your list and now I can't wait, either!! Hurry up with the happy, relieved and peaceful onward and upward!! Congratulations😎"
<|emo_surprise|> Was at wreck beach yesterday a guy was masturbating around kids family etc just sitting next to a log...
"<|emo_disgust|> I’d tell her nothing, that freaking weirdo would just never see my kid. The End. Disgusting."
"<|emo_disgust|> Super weird question. Not really commenting either way, just so weird the life we have created for modern humans."
"<|emo_sad|> That ""Hard work"" usually involved the junkrat pressing Q so I'm not about to shed tears"
<|emo_sad|> Sad and very true though. Case in point.
<|emo_joy|> If there was ever such thing as a tasteful neck beard this is it. Such a beautiful bird
<|emo_sad|> This is painfully fake
"<|emo_disgust|> Of course these are all conspiracy theory shitposts BUT just because he got squeezed out, doesn’t mean they want him playing for a rival team."
<|emo_anger|> I hate when people Beijing a gun. Even worse when they Shanghai one.
"<|emo_disgust|> Wow your sister is in abusive relationship, cool. "
"<|emo_disgust|> What an awful video. I just wanted to see the jump in real time, not 10 cuts of the start, followed by 1 slomo finish."
<|emo_joy|> Yes! Im glad you see where he got that n-word take from 😂😂
<|emo_joy|> That was such a good cast. Loved that year.
<|emo_anger|> Yeah no more concussions in Madden now. Only non head related injuries occur.
<|emo_fear|> Scary stuff.
<|emo_sad|> Y’all some sharks. I’m really just out here trying to be hopeful for the future of my team after a heart shattering lost.
"<|emo_sad|> The few people that survive jumping from bridges say, almost invariably, that they regretted jumping the second they entered free fall."
"<|emo_anger|> This picture is a prime example that [NAME] are intolerant douchebags who will always demonize wealth, fame, and entertainment."
<|emo_sad|> The most cringeworthy thing about this is that they have missed a golden opportunity to say pizza time.
"<|emo_anger|> I wonder why the fuck out of this alive. well, there was a perfectly reasonable explanation."
<|emo_fear|> This has to be made as a satire of terrible memes . Like r/okbuddyretard material

<|emo_anger|> How dare you make an attempt to be kind!
"<|emo_anger|> I will have nothing to do with this specter, who selectively appears to individuals and abandons others. No better than a cruel warlord."
<|emo_anger|> Here a great example of what adrenaline from fear and panic make an animal do.
<|emo_anger|> Maybe? I was def too busy going “ohmygawd motherfucking KING SHARK!?! 🦈 “ to notice
"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, it’d be weird to have two green arrows running around. "
<|emo_surprise|> I'm more surprised the dash cam was functioning properly. Usually around these incidents 3 of them were not recording and one had the lens cap on...
<|emo_joy|> I enjoyed that Bagel Boss commercial. Suddenly craving some Greiss Coffee.
<|emo_sad|> Haters gonna hate that which they don't understand.

<|emo_sad|> Sorry. This thing knows whats up!
"<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid you're completely correct. Sad, but true."
<|emo_anger|> You sound jealous as fuck. Work hard and you too can drive a nice car.
<|emo_disgust|> Southern Mexico tends to always get fucked in the ass as well

"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah i know that feeling, i don't know if they abandoned it, i ordered this on amazon."
<|emo_anger|> Such bullshit. Reloading components included? Not that they'd let that stand in subsequent laws if it is.
"<|emo_disgust|> *DRAINS, CLOGS, BACKED UP LOGS [NAME]!* *OH, NO, TOILET OVERFLOW [NAME]!*"
<|emo_anger|> sorry. I don't want to put words in your mouth.
<|emo_sad|> Idk my brain doesn’t process what I’m watching if I can’t read along at the same time
<|emo_disgust|> Weird flex but ok
<|emo_disgust|> I won’t but if I tell him to have a threesome didn’t I open the door for him to cheat
"<|emo_joy|> My thoughts exactly, now im laughing at the people responding to the headline"

<|emo_fear|> I'm worried that even in the summer we're not going to have the funds necessary to do that.
<|emo_joy|> Hell yeah! Don't let all the jokes get to you. You be happy being you!
"<|emo_sad|> Anyone else stressed out because [NAME] is not next to [NAME]... no? Ok, me neither"
<|emo_fear|> Conversion to make gay people straight. It's horrifying
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you really missed the point, didn't you?"
<|emo_disgust|> There's those people that compliment me all the time and you can tell it's so forced and fake and I honestly dont know what to say
<|emo_fear|> Bedside report is terrible.
"<|emo_fear|> *police proceed to slide down hill* *I quickly jump in police cruiser, as friend holds bumper*"
<|emo_sad|> Makes me sad I'll never be with a beautiful woman.
"<|emo_anger|> Every time I get a staff kill, it feels like seeing a shooting star <3 Yeah, it definitely sucks."

<|emo_fear|> Conversion to make gay people straight. It's horrifying

<|emo_fear|> It was done before and it was terrible
<|emo_fear|> Seeing that knife on this subreddit put the fear of [NAME] in me
<|emo_joy|> I bet you’re really fun at parties.
<|emo_surprise|> Then he stabbed like five cops and hid in a haystack
"<|emo_fear|> This spring is so loaded, it's almost too much at once!"
<|emo_anger|> FEAR THE TURTLE
<|emo_anger|> One period? Damn you think it would last that long

<|emo_sad|> that made me cry tears of sadness and joy at the same time.
<|emo_anger|> FoX cHaNnEl BaD!!!!!
"<|emo_anger|> Oh man. Hardest lesson for me to learn as a new dm was that even with experienced players, combat with 7 PCs is brutally time consuming "

<|emo_disgust|> Should of just stabbed her up tbh why let someone steal from you

<|emo_sad|> The diagonal photo is killing me. Why is it like that?
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is really going to have to work his ass off to make this team.
<|emo_fear|> Aww a homophone on top of everything else. No wonder you carry a gun. You’re a coward who’s afraid of the world.

<|emo_surprise|> Wait wait wait... did [NAME] go 61-27??
<|emo_anger|> I would be more offended to be served cereal on a plate.
"<|emo_sad|> Got a bit tipsy in my room alone, dancing in my underwear to some cheesy music for the whole night, and then cried myself to sleep"
<|emo_anger|> You’re an angry elf
"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, sometimes you just remember stuff! It's a little weird to thank yourself publicly, but why not?"

<|emo_anger|> Don’t hate barstool
<|emo_joy|> I'm really happy he and [NAME] are finding success
<|emo_sad|> Poor baby :( I hope the snake is doing ok
"<|emo_disgust|> What should be the campaign is telling people that just because you find a child beautiful/pretty, it doesn't mean you're sexually attracted. "
<|emo_sad|> I have endured worse.
<|emo_disgust|> Got damn look at that body
"<|emo_anger|> People are gonna end up hating Deus Ex because of this, and that's just a travesty"
"<|emo_disgust|> It's a self-identifying group, and they have killed quite a bit of people in their crusade for revenge. It's both absolutely pathetic and absolutely terrifying."

<|emo_anger|> Stupid [NAME] referencing that stupid seagull/cricket myth
"<|emo_joy|> Yay, congratulations! :D"
"<|emo_disgust|> I agree with in general with your perspective, but as someone who loves music--new and old--I gotta say, lil pump really does suck"

<|emo_joy|> I'm enjoying the witty comments but anyone want to throw in some analysis?
<|emo_disgust|> 1) I think my least favorite thing our kid has done would be spit up in my mouth. 2) Vomit is worse than spit up
<|emo_fear|> After 8? I'm afraid after 5. It gets dark here early. :(
<|emo_sad|> Yeah Stupid Sexy groening
"<|emo_anger|> The FDA has plenty to criticize. But like here, it's usually criticized horribly off base. It needs to grow some balls and actually enforce things. "
<|emo_surprise|> It surprises me Turkey doesn't intervene even there. I would presume that at least OB-ES areas are off limits and Turkey would intervene if HTS entered them.
"<|emo_disgust|> They’ve changed their mind so clearly they would change their position when scrutinised. Like you said though, he was ignored. "
<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe people actually pay for these. 😩

<|emo_surprise|> The surprise would be that we just broke a 16 year old record...
<|emo_joy|> Omg this made me laugh!

<|emo_sad|> I’m so homesick and I come here for photos like this.

<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how many managers you've pissed off
<|emo_surprise|> Change the channel during the NFC Playoffs? Hey did you ever pay that ticket? No? Just wondering....
<|emo_anger|> People are idiots! No one should shame [NAME] for doing her job as a mom! Shame [NAME] instead for putting her kids' life in danger!
"<|emo_anger|> was i replying to you, you fucking degenerate? off yourself ( in game ofc )"
"<|emo_disgust|> They don’t like him, so he is divisive. It’s projection."
<|emo_sad|> Sorry to hear that was all it got :/

<|emo_joy|> I am so happy that sub exists
"<|emo_disgust|> You say weaboo, we say virgin"
<|emo_fear|> I can’t see many players having a problem with [NAME] being gone. Sometimes a coaching change can create the jump start this team needs.
<|emo_joy|> Honestly I don't care if they're faked. It's an original concept that I find pretty funny
"<|emo_joy|> Ah yes thank u, now the image is very funny"
<|emo_sad|> I bet he jerks off while holding a gun in his mouth while crying.
<|emo_joy|> Sakura drops & Goodbye happiness

<|emo_joy|> Just hanging out at UQ St Lucia is pretty cool.
<|emo_sad|> Because in some cases parents are basically having their own children kidnapped and held against their will and forced into these programs. This is child abuse.

<|emo_disgust|> We cant even get sexually assaulted without them claiming we're gross fetishists
<|emo_surprise|> I had no idea this was a thing!

"<|emo_fear|> yikes, as someone who dislocates things often ([NAME]), this scares me!"
"<|emo_anger|> Well damn, sounds more reliable then shit like and all that"

<|emo_joy|> As you wish the hard path is a good one :)
"<|emo_disgust|> Partial reopening within the next two weeks for services to the [NAME], but unfortunately for some a lot of the government is never coming back from this."
"<|emo_sad|> I don't, I think this is great. The more they disbelieve media, the more it hurts them."
<|emo_anger|> That might’ve been the worst pass he’s ever thrown. Yikes
<|emo_fear|> Cancer is even scarier my friend. Let's just hug it out

<|emo_joy|> I wish it were. It would be funny to imply that [NAME] won [NAME] shirt!
<|emo_sad|> I miss you big strong daddy

<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised that the police have not send her to a mental institution

<|emo_fear|> Gee that sure is a strange way to spell [NAME].
<|emo_sad|> Wimbledon’s instagram posted about [NAME] and his relationship with the Open and I ended up crying. Not ready for him to hang it up
<|emo_joy|> I really enjoyed it actually. The world and the monster seemed really cool an original idea.
<|emo_anger|> I just mentioned it to another poster but we have reached Poe's Law where I actually don't know if they are being satirical or not.
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh look, this entire account was made to link to a store that sells this mug."
<|emo_disgust|> Licking the grease from people’s fingers as they leave chicken cottage for sustenance.
<|emo_disgust|> Found the selfish and shitty anti-vaxxer in the thread. How many of us have to die before you get your fucking kids vaccinated?
<|emo_anger|> Could you imagine the outrage if Canada rescued one of our citizens from the Saudi courts
<|emo_anger|> And yet none of ya'll are willing to even let 3rd party candidates in the building. Got to love the hypocrisy

<|emo_sad|> Yeah that was my bad. I was just heated after that loss and was being an ass. My b
<|emo_disgust|> So we should stop caring about other people and only look out for ourselves. That DOES sound like a baby boomer!
<|emo_sad|> And those poor kids are still paying for it. And we have actual grown adults that are bullying them even today.
<|emo_anger|> Great fucking game for [NAME]. And I can't believe some people are trying to hate on him for one TOV in the 4th. This fan base smh
"<|emo_joy|> Meh, the Chiefs got gifted a PI call or two, especially on their last drive to tie the game."
"<|emo_fear|> For us to be able to do that now, they would proably make us pay for it. "
"<|emo_joy|> Nah, just gotta aim better."
"<|emo_disgust|> That doesn’t sound right, but I don’t know enough about stars to dispute it."
<|emo_joy|> Just got my nose pierced last week! So fun to have the freedom. :)

<|emo_anger|> Edited because my kneejerk response was kind of unnecessarily harsh. :/
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] are the liars, we know."
"<|emo_anger|> It's like 20,000 words about a teenager. Fucking insanity."
<|emo_surprise|> Same.. I wonder why we catastrophize over these minor things so much and others seem to be able to forget them..
"<|emo_surprise|> 1. How was the video fabricated? 2. Even if it was, how would this invalidate my statement?"
"<|emo_anger|> What a manipulative, child of a man. Jeez, grow up."

<|emo_anger|> Why is it arrogant to think LIVING IN A FUCKING BEAR CARCASS is wrong?
"<|emo_anger|> I mean, it was season two level of “what the fuck are you doing writers?!”"

"<|emo_anger|> You're didn't vote for her you are obviously a racist, sexist, homophobe, you're the worst kinda person."
"<|emo_surprise|> Wonder if her steel balls make the same sound, clanging together, when they're frozen?"

<|emo_anger|> Ha ha manu plays shit football amirite guys
"<|emo_joy|> LOL, I suppose so. All I'm saying is that... you can have a person and make them appealing too."

<|emo_joy|> I'm so happy you said this. I just accepted that I was going crazy.
"<|emo_joy|> I enjoy vintage cooking porn. A young [NAME] trussing a round roast, for example. "

"<|emo_anger|> The kid you're replying too is a known [NAME] stan lol, he's gonna argue with any narrative that [NAME] is close to [NAME]."

<|emo_surprise|> Chipotleee! [NAME] Damitt! Closes in 39 Seconds.. but we made it!! Loved this guy!!
<|emo_joy|> I'm a girl and got the belt for doing something similar with another girl.
<|emo_joy|> Ah I love when I’m looking at a random thread and find you in the comments. Hey [NAME]!
<|emo_joy|> Double doink Love it
<|emo_anger|> I'm pretty sure the armor still shows on the person after you kill them even if it is broken.
"<|emo_anger|> I'm just messing with you, dont be mad! I actually upvoted you, its probably just burried under all the downvotes."
"<|emo_disgust|> She took the fucking kids, huh?"
<|emo_disgust|> That's pretty gross. Unlucky OP.
<|emo_sad|> Survival of the toughest.
<|emo_anger|> please kill me.
<|emo_sad|> Mom will get sad. [NAME] still good. Hanging out with friends still good. Money buying foodie exp is still good.
<|emo_joy|> This is my new favorite video.
"<|emo_disgust|> What an obnoxious, drunk girl. "
<|emo_anger|> What the hell happened today? There must have been a pretty major disagreement.
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah it’s fine. Some supplements contain Ashwagandha which affects the gaba receptors so be cautious if you’re already on gabapentin or a beta blocker
<|emo_disgust|> I need to find a term for this so badly.
<|emo_anger|> I feel so stupid. I’ve never made the connection between [NAME] refusing to play for SD and [NAME]

<|emo_surprise|> wow! trust issues.
<|emo_sad|> Sad face it is
"<|emo_sad|> ""We lost good people on both sides"""
<|emo_anger|> Talking about scary foreign people spreading disease is a classic xenophobic trope. Vile.
<|emo_anger|> Yea the refs weren't terrible all game or anything
<|emo_joy|> No need to apologize. It definitely put things in perspective. I’m just glad your DD ended up ok.
<|emo_anger|> I know it's like this hipster phrase it's so stupid like you're not from the south you dumb motherfuker.
<|emo_sad|> I wanna die
<|emo_joy|> Ahhh. A civil and interesting conversation on the internet. How refreshing.
<|emo_sad|> Aw bummer. She lost her screenshot of the copy of a copy of bullshit articles handwritten in 1992. Somebody help a girl out.
<|emo_sad|> That definitely hurt
<|emo_fear|> I literally screamed uncontrollably for 3 months and ended up in a mental hospital.

<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is the worst coach in bulls history
"<|emo_sad|> You can't post a Sons pic and then say ""I got this"", that just hurts."

<|emo_joy|> It is certainly interesting.....but is it anything?.....
"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, that was dirty."
<|emo_anger|> This team is fucking embarrassing.
<|emo_joy|> Let me just say that your posts over the past twelve days have brought me so much joy
<|emo_surprise|> SWTOR is horrible when you want to play together with someone. So many parts that you can't join in on.
<|emo_surprise|> And to think all along I was wondering if it was left hand turn day or just me!
<|emo_sad|> I have cried in hotel rooms before thinking about the loss from discovering it is a lie. It's tragic and wonderful at the same time.
<|emo_anger|> Oh you're referencing my reply to another comment? I was mad at low effort comments and people who can't comprehend a simple point.
<|emo_surprise|> I like how /r/gaybros just turned 7 and this type of post is still the most common. Paging /u/-Massachoosite
<|emo_surprise|> The nerve of that [NAME] album on his wall. I still can’t believe he has a child.
<|emo_anger|> oh my [NAME] easily one of the worst sounds aaahhhhhh
<|emo_anger|> 5 days?!? But I'm mad now!
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow that’s scary, she’s so young and healthy. I hate that. "
"<|emo_anger|> YEAH, YOU MOTHERFUCKER"
"<|emo_joy|> Oh look even more whinging by a Brexshitter about how its all gonna sort it self out fine, such fantastic info."
<|emo_sad|> Lmao no fun allowed
<|emo_disgust|> I came back to work and I found the charlkboard like this. No idea how it got that way. Weird.
"<|emo_fear|> Manipulation. I love my mother btw, but this thing is insidious."
"<|emo_sad|> Same, I hate myself for finding the last 4 chapters... my heart is devastated."
"<|emo_fear|> I don’t know who [NAME] is and, at this point, I’m too afraid to ask."
"<|emo_joy|> 2010 offseason, thought we'd get [NAME], ended up with [NAME] for 100 mil. we still talking about the knicks. fun to dream tho"
<|emo_fear|> Oh dear lord. Imagine if [NAME] scores off the break from a scoring chance of [NAME] and [NAME]

<|emo_disgust|> Grandma is bad at math
"<|emo_anger|> ""These people didn't go to my church therefore they are demonic"""
"<|emo_sad|> You got me on that one - I did just check and you're right, we didn't actually talk about that particular subject matter. My bad."
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] bless your soul. Please keep us updated. HORRAY!
<|emo_fear|> not at all. Hong kong streets and roads are super narrow. I get claustrophobic there.
<|emo_fear|> This is nightmare fuel
<|emo_surprise|> It was shocking to me when I realized this! Best of luck on your journey!
<|emo_disgust|> Its much better. Inhaling burned particulate plant matter is very bad.
<|emo_joy|> This is amazing!
<|emo_surprise|> An online poll that the Berners didn't manage to swarm? Color me shocked.
<|emo_joy|> To laugh at the bad memes
<|emo_sad|> You sound upset.
<|emo_sad|> Looks like the Content ID system picked up a song you used in your video. Sound about right?

"<|emo_joy|> Lol, thank you for my first upvote and for contacting the mods. "
"<|emo_fear|> Dangerous indeed. While vaccinations killed diseases like smallpox, theyre indirectly killing children in their fear they might kill or ruin them..."
<|emo_anger|> THROW OUT BOYLEN
"<|emo_joy|> Man, I would cry tears of joy if my two-year-old cousin could just say my name, let alone say a coherent sentence."
<|emo_sad|> The thought of him having to schedule me in really turns me off and makes me sad. Has the reduced gaming time helped with intimacy in any way?
<|emo_joy|> A-fucking-men! :)
<|emo_anger|> You have a very justifiable reason to be upset and vent. I am this happened to you.
<|emo_disgust|> Drive thru is the worst. The number of times people would sneeze in my face at the window was infuriating.
"<|emo_joy|> (While I love this moment, she wasn’t a judge, she was an inspirational guest.)"
<|emo_anger|> So basically what we have is a horribly exploitative business model meant to prey on drivers by tricking them into accepting unprofitable rides.
"<|emo_joy|> Truly a beautiful story, 11/10 :')"
"<|emo_surprise|> That’s unfortunate! Without having knowledge of the incident, it’s difficult to say why the surgeon had liability."
"<|emo_disgust|> I mean, it certainly is weird but don't kinkshame"
<|emo_sad|> Not defending [NAME] at all but this is just super sad if it’s true...
<|emo_joy|> there's no limit when it comes to owning dogs.. more dogs = more love
<|emo_surprise|> It seems strange to me that [NAME] is still unsigned this close to the season.
"<|emo_joy|> Oh, I’m so sorry! Good luck, I hope your 3000% more successful than me! Sending love and support!!!!!"
<|emo_anger|> You cant.Its the idiot civilian drivers fault for probably just staying behind him like a zombie. Unless they come out with heated trailers soon.
<|emo_joy|> This was literally me!
"<|emo_sad|> Im really sad, and there is alot more goin on but i dont know how to tell it."
<|emo_anger|> I for one am with you on this train. I loved [NAME] man but this sub is losing its damn mind lol

<|emo_sad|> No not funny just sad
<|emo_disgust|> Cheaper to burn the car
"<|emo_joy|> It's a pretty old and actually funny joke, just converted into a ragecomic. "
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME], that fucking sucks."
<|emo_fear|> Did the same thing more than 20 years ago and I still think about it periodically. Brutal.
<|emo_anger|> Now THIS IS shitposting
"<|emo_joy|> For some people this is mindblowing, simple mind, simple pleasures "
<|emo_sad|> Sorry you had to live there. Good news is they are demolishing it in 2020.
<|emo_surprise|> I always wondered where it was on ormond. I managed to find the toolbox last week on yamaoka as killer.
<|emo_disgust|> You're creepy
<|emo_anger|> Well that sucks
"<|emo_fear|> Oh, the horror! We must defend the honor of Lord [NAME] against the scum of r/NFL!!"
<|emo_fear|> This is why I could never work in construction

<|emo_disgust|> holy fk [NAME] is the guy in the gym who thinks hes a star but he just isnt
"<|emo_anger|> > We're angry, but we don't want to be labelled as violent nutters."
<|emo_surprise|> The thing that screams narc to me is that you still had an 8pm curfew at age 20.
"<|emo_disgust|> Well, I knew that a lot of people don't trim their bushes in the eastern suburbs, but that's ridiculous."
<|emo_joy|> WON ME 1K LAST GAME IN PARLAY!!
"<|emo_anger|> Worse, he murdered King [NAME] in the most cowardly way possible. Both in the books and the show. "
<|emo_disgust|> I’ve never heard of this before. That’s awful.
<|emo_joy|> You're probably joking but [NAME] has been pretty insightful regarding the yellow vests in France. I was impressed.
<|emo_joy|> funny
"<|emo_sad|> It's hard for me to switch between english and spanish in the same sentence, sorry I'll try to improve in the future"
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I wonder who's going on about Tahiti in the background."
<|emo_surprise|> How did this not get marked as meta? Tried posting something similar here and it was instantly flagged as “meta commentary about the sub” and blocked.
"<|emo_sad|> Get a card that says “Sorry about your loss” on the front, then on the inside write “It’s me. I quit”."
<|emo_joy|> Lmao “now everyone *has* a job”
"<|emo_joy|> YAAAS! Even though you're a stranger on the internet, this has made my day."
<|emo_sad|> My nuts hurt watching that second part
"<|emo_anger|> Are you implying that I can not determine guilt by seeing a person's skin color and tense smile, you fucking racist?"
<|emo_sad|> The saddest part is that just this morning when we were laying in bed I was thinking about how much I love him.
<|emo_joy|> So glad to hear that! you go girl<3
"<|emo_anger|> Do you have any non anecdotal stuff to say or? Also burden of proof is a thing, you made a claim, prove it or fuck off"
<|emo_sad|> This makes me wanna die
<|emo_sad|> Passed a CR England driver last week who had his phone mounted in the middle of his windshield with video playing. Blatant retardism
"<|emo_surprise|> What a catch, that's how you win championship games there. Wow."
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] how is [NAME] even a rapper. I thought rappers were people you would wanna be lol
<|emo_anger|> I hated broccoli until my parents tapped into my obsession with dinosaurs and got me to pretend I was a brontosaurus
"<|emo_fear|> The 5 days got an audible ""[NAME]"" out of me. That's terrifying. "
"<|emo_sad|> Poor lady, she was the mother of a friend of my wife, and she went to school with my father in law :("
<|emo_sad|> Hurr durr everyone needs to worry about other people’s problems
"<|emo_fear|> Yeah, people my age make me more anxious than older people. I feel like my generation is more judgmental."
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah, all the stun cannonballs are horrible. "
"<|emo_fear|> Some people just need reassurance that they are, in fact, dumb. "
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah, sorry about that. I see it in so many post I thought it was almost a custom to do so."
<|emo_surprise|> What a cuck! But the sword and steal the groceries!
"<|emo_anger|> agree, we are living in the feminist era where women want to be equal - so why should they be 'selective' in whats equal or not."
"<|emo_disgust|>  anyone who hasn't seen this, it's unbelievably bad."
"<|emo_joy|> I work from home and live with my daughters. It's so serene, but also a lot of fun because we have great times together."
"<|emo_anger|> I pirated this movie last night and can confirm: it's truly awful. Not just lacking in good, but *aggressively* bad."
<|emo_joy|> Good god there’s so many cheapskates here trying to justify it by insulting me! Pretty funny tbh
"<|emo_anger|> Dude, its **life** it's not **trauma**. Grow up "
<|emo_disgust|> worst is when people with dogs think they know what it's like to be a parent omg like you dont even know YOU DONT EVEN KNOW
<|emo_sad|> What a sad post. I cannot believe people actually follow their advice.
<|emo_joy|> Aw it’s the same user who was scared of breast feeding lmao

<|emo_surprise|> surprised he hasn’t mentioned [NAME] after saying [NAME] the best manager/coach he’s ever worked with
<|emo_disgust|> People who eat themselves to death are mentally ill in my opinion. Homicide is a deliberate and unlawful killing of a person by another person.
<|emo_disgust|> Communism is 100x worse than muh evil nazis. Commies need the whole world to follow their ideology and even then it would not work.
"<|emo_joy|> Good thing you listened to your gut, ran, and made a lot of noise! Yikes! Glad you're ok."
<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit I didn’t realize he didn’t fumble all season that’s wild
"<|emo_anger|> Close the door, you're letting the heat out!"
"<|emo_disgust|> Try nonchalantly handing them your card as if they had dropped it. I think its normal to be shy. *handing on exit, otherwise it could get awkward"
<|emo_joy|> Finally the UN gets off their ass and does something. So glad she’s finally safe (for now).
"<|emo_fear|> Honestly, back then, seeing her squirm would have been perfect. I'm mildly curious to see if she's still scared of me, though."
<|emo_joy|> In draft I see a lot of enchantress. Even without Enchantress if Lodestone Demolition gets 6 dmg(same as Lightning Strike) I am happy.
<|emo_sad|> Damn [NAME] let himself go
<|emo_joy|> Over 9000 IQ Tracer. Cheers love.
<|emo_anger|> Who the hell has all these power tools but no hammer
<|emo_surprise|> In shock and was more concerned about my kid tbh. Now off course I wish I'd sued the arse off her for emotional distress.
"<|emo_anger|> Careful, you are almost criticizing your god in chief. Your friends at TD will probably ban you for that."
"<|emo_disgust|> What an awful video. I just wanted to see the jump in real time, not 10 cuts of the start, followed by 1 slomo finish."
<|emo_disgust|> I have a deep seeded hatred for close-minded people too.
<|emo_surprise|> Nah dude it shows they aren't depressed adults but instead very cool kiddos.
<|emo_disgust|> Disgusting of you [NAME] you filthy who're you pedophilic scum trying to beguile our children it's not gonna work I got [NAME] castorated

<|emo_sad|> I can feel that man's feelings and I'm crying
<|emo_sad|> Unless you have an established career and are a high earner then sorry but you _are_ the shared housing type.
<|emo_fear|> They start as needy creeps and work their way up to being dangerous.
<|emo_joy|> I’m really glad [NAME] wasn’t [NAME]
<|emo_anger|> Stupidly stubborn / stubbornly stupid
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh man, what was the name of that show. It feels so familiar. Haven't watched MTV in, I don't know, 15 years? "
"<|emo_surprise|> ""Oh, we just happen to have all this stuff over here, like a normal date."""
<|emo_sad|> ooh boy that guy went off the deep end and drowned
"<|emo_anger|> I'm sorry but [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME] are my favs this year (and I hated [NAME] in her Season)."
"<|emo_surprise|> I couldn’t imagine putting a brand new car on these roads, let alone a Tesla."
<|emo_surprise|> And butt. I can't believe butt cracks are blurred in US shows!
<|emo_surprise|> That's an unexpected pair of fighters.
<|emo_disgust|> They love to prey on women that have just given birth. It’s so disgusting!
<|emo_sad|> Sorry to hear about that and hope you have moved on.
<|emo_fear|> This is terrifying
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] can’t you see, you’re being way too loud for me"
<|emo_surprise|> just read it... how do these people get away with such garbage decisions.
<|emo_disgust|> The article didn’t use it. OP just did a bad copy paste I think.
<|emo_joy|> Lots of words and said nothing. Cheers.
<|emo_disgust|> Fucking hell! I've been out there protesting orange people all this time. I need funding for new signs!
<|emo_anger|> My parents are going to kill me when they find out.
"<|emo_anger|> I have to admit, most of the worst people I have encountered in my life were met while LARPing."
<|emo_anger|> All the people who got on at canning bridge station this morning and kept pushing and shoving each other like animals.
<|emo_disgust|> No it really is there maybe you suck at google
<|emo_anger|> Fuck this gif
"<|emo_anger|> Would breaking her jaw and hands be out of line? She couldn’t call or text, what a shame. "
<|emo_disgust|> This has been reposted so many times the photo is degrading.
<|emo_anger|> That is an exceedingly rare failure. I read an article about this guy. He was just stupid and stopped there.
"<|emo_joy|> Fun fact. If you combined North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming and Montana into one state it would have roughly the same population as Puerto Rico!"
<|emo_joy|> :). I got you brotha. Dame says hi
<|emo_sad|> I fail to see how a current moderator isn't capable. Perhaps they never delegated the task is all.
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] (swt) does not need your worship. If you do good deeds and humble yourself and seek forgiveness He might guide you again.
<|emo_joy|> Ngl the entire first order feels like a joke...
<|emo_fear|> Lip piercings would be painful bloody and easily pulled out... Nipple piercings hurt tremendously if ripped and are also easily ripped out
<|emo_anger|> I thought it was very good. The guy was one sick bastard that’s for sure.
<|emo_sad|> She gets genuinely emotional sometimes too. I love it. So refreshing
<|emo_joy|> This happened at my local Odeon last night. The amount of confused faces was kinda funny to watch.
<|emo_surprise|> My friends thought I was asexual
"<|emo_joy|> Wow this is the first I’ve heard of this. You should go tell /r/hockey, I’m sure they have no idea either."
"<|emo_joy|> Think you're pretty funny, don't you, freak?"
<|emo_disgust|> My bitch dun left me All alone She took mah squeeky ball And mah rasty bone
<|emo_anger|> What. The. Fresh. Fuck.
<|emo_fear|> Because love is a lie and there is no happiness in the world
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if losing their majority in the 2019 locals would shift the Unionist parties’ position?
<|emo_anger|> Oh we’re TANKING tanking
<|emo_surprise|> That sucks. Learn to check your ping like everyone else.
<|emo_fear|> This is horrific
<|emo_anger|> Ya done goofed kid. All you had to do was win.

<|emo_anger|> Shawty whats wrong with you. I want those people dead
"<|emo_surprise|> I didn't know that, thank you for teaching me something today!"
<|emo_surprise|> #SHOCKEEEEEEEEEEEER!
"<|emo_anger|> What I said applies to all of /r/politics, not just this incident."
<|emo_fear|> i didnt realize i was avoiding a question. i am afraid to talk to cops to be honest. even my own mother doesnt know what i saw
<|emo_anger|> Damn. Hope they don’t have children
<|emo_joy|> Everytime I get to hug someone.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh no he didn't!
<|emo_joy|> I knew I'd find it.
<|emo_sad|> spurs getting carried away now. Fouling their own players.
"<|emo_joy|> Ah I see, thanks. I struggle with the order of the sentences in English from time to time, so I'm glad for any help :) "
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] isn’t a rocket scientist. I was surprised about the Thailand thing tbh I did expect it to be true haha.
"<|emo_fear|> Warning to all new comers, you are likely to experience Delayed Onset Muscle Sadness."
<|emo_joy|> Happy cake day brother!

<|emo_anger|> Worst episode of the entire show
<|emo_sad|> I read it on NRK as well. Brought tears to my eyes.
<|emo_disgust|> I’ve thrown up
"<|emo_joy|> I'd hardly call them innocent if they're reveling in the thought of more mass shootings. People like that deserve worse, quite frankly."
"<|emo_anger|> I mean I still attend regular school, this is just a Saturday school. I'm just frustrated that I have to waste Saturday on this"
<|emo_disgust|> It's weird because sometimes I care and sometimes I don't. Although I wouldn't call myself an asexual I could be leaning more towards demisexual.
<|emo_joy|> I would say ask him. Don't read into things too much. Just enjoy. You'll never know if you don't ask.
<|emo_disgust|> Right?? It makes no sense she’s horrible
"<|emo_joy|> I found this post under the ""sjw"" tag on ifunny and it had like 100 happy faces "
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] will probably get something as worse as [NAME] in ep4
<|emo_disgust|> Something I just thought of... Can you email her or text her instead of call? I find it's easier to deal with difficult people that way.
<|emo_disgust|> Close your damn mouth before it catches a fly
"<|emo_joy|> I have no clue what that is, but I hope you have fun"
<|emo_joy|> Very happy with this !
<|emo_disgust|> A better description would be she got a nasty fright rather than it being terrifying.
"<|emo_anger|> You would think so, huh? Not the first dude who has tried to use that rationale. The first one I dated though."
<|emo_joy|> True. I just always enjoyed the atmosphere of that place. And a couple of the sandwiches weren't bad at all.
<|emo_surprise|> Aye but happy cake day mate.
"<|emo_joy|> I mean, Introverted Intuition is a perceiving function and INTJs lead with it, so yeah."
<|emo_surprise|> It is. Something I've wondered about many times
"<|emo_disgust|> I get ghosted all the time after I open pics. I don't like it, so would not do it to someone else."
<|emo_sad|> I am really sad because my innocent nieces are brainwashed by my crazy sister
"<|emo_surprise|> With [NAME] at over 30m (on average), our 2nd expensive player is only at 14.7m? Wow..."
"<|emo_sad|> I'm not advocating eating the pain away, but bring apples just in case. "
"<|emo_joy|> Welcome to The World of... Mobile MMOs. Where power can be yours, for a price."

"<|emo_anger|> No thanks, he’s already been flushed"
<|emo_sad|> This sounds so painful. I am so sorry. This ED is literally a demon.
<|emo_sad|> I've never been more disturbed by a dog
<|emo_sad|> Lots of internalized rage and mom guilt daily leading to a good shower cry once a week or so.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I've never heard of a celebrity doing something so nice
<|emo_sad|> If the restaurant had only been around for 20 years clearly he’s mistaken when he claimed he’d been coming there for 40
"<|emo_sad|> You're making me look bad [NAME], while she yells and screams."
<|emo_sad|> BREAKING NEWS: The new girl had to shred/chip a 6lb entire chub of Kentucky Gold ham today. Poor girl's arm ached the rest of the day.
<|emo_sad|> Us arguing here won’t change a thing in the government
"<|emo_fear|> Yeah it isn't the same singer. 'Don't hug me I'm scared' is voiced by [NAME], the lead singer of KKB is [NAME]"
<|emo_anger|> When [NAME] pisses off his daughter and wife. Daughter: “You’re not my Daddy anymore” [NAME]: “You’re not my Daddy anymore either”
<|emo_sad|> Imagine ur mom doing that I’m crying
"<|emo_fear|> Deathly afraid, the undersides of boats too. I can't look if I see them in a picture or movie"
<|emo_joy|> I like how the money blows into her face halfway-through. That's some quality filming.
"<|emo_anger|> Ha, my husband goes out after you guys have done your thing and checks for himself, he's been burned too many times."
<|emo_anger|> The emojis in the background. Wtf lmao
<|emo_joy|> Ahh you must be speaking of M & W Industries! I know it well I'll never forget the smell of pickles.
<|emo_anger|> I am so mad I haven’t thought of doing this. Just brilliant
"<|emo_fear|> Welp. That sucks. I always check left and right when crossing an intersection, getting T-boned is one of my biggest fears."
<|emo_disgust|> I swear these people would try to sell shoes to someone without feet.
"<|emo_joy|> Hey [NAME], I'm [NAME] ! :) "
<|emo_anger|> This is all the creativity you folks could muster today? Up is down and red is blue? I was hoping for a little more effort. r/terribletrollisterribleattrolling
<|emo_sad|> God damn I miss this game!
"<|emo_joy|> When I was in high school, a girl told me I looked like [NAME] from The Little Mermaid. *Ouch*"
<|emo_joy|> How much money did you find exactly? If it was a lot then you probably took their cash and the bones were left as a warning.
"<|emo_anger|> I was quoting him. He wanted an ""outsider rich business type"", piss off"
<|emo_joy|> That's my favorite! It smells so good without being overpowering.
<|emo_sad|> I feel your pain. Sitting here wallowing in self pity and anger at how I let myself go!
<|emo_surprise|> Got damn look at that body
<|emo_joy|> A car. Let someone else eat the immediate depreciation and break it in for you.
"<|emo_fear|> oh man clicking 2 buttons before you read an article, the absolute horror"
<|emo_joy|> Omg I want this dog ❤️❤️❤️
<|emo_anger|> I'd argue they are advocating not fighting the fire in your house when the entire neighborhood is engulfed in flames.
"<|emo_sad|> I’m sorry :(. Lol. For me, after the ending of 3, and Andromeda, I have zero interest in ME."
<|emo_anger|> I do: PUT SOME CLOTHES ON
<|emo_surprise|> I drove off 170 onto 40 and was surprised by the lack of brakelights.... keep it closed haha
<|emo_surprise|> Can you imagine being taken to court over a flushing loo? I can’t believe the courts are even entertaining this.
"<|emo_anger|> Each Dark Souls game has been voted ""Most Likely to Result in Controller Damage""."
"<|emo_anger|> Windbreakers, we’re supposed to wear them when it’s cold as apparently a joke to keep us warm 🙃 I hate doing drive ups now"
<|emo_disgust|> LMAO why are [NAME] so bad at this primarying thing. [NAME] and [NAME] are both gonna win their primaries at this point.
<|emo_sad|> I miss [NAME] and [NAME]. :(
"<|emo_sad|> When you feel bad, remember his comments on [NAME] throwing the shoe. He sucks."
<|emo_joy|> It’s 2019 dude chill out with the gender roles Edit: it’s 2019 I’m tired sorry
"<|emo_disgust|> Your imaginary boyfriend is kinda creepy. Although, if he's kinky then he may be for keeps. *wink "
<|emo_sad|> It's hard to be good to yourself.
"<|emo_anger|> Oh, fuck off. It’s no one’s fault but yours that you think every mention of the word ‘men’ means you specifically. "
"<|emo_sad|> I never even thought of that, just that it’s the most uncomfortable way to sit in a car, especially on the driver side! "
<|emo_anger|> Not to be a pedant but him being a corrections officer and her a felon doesn't mean shit to me about whether the abuse is legitimate.
<|emo_joy|> Omg yes!
<|emo_sad|> I really hate ginger ale. With a passion. The scenario in that scene makes me sick to my stomach.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] that's so satisfying
"<|emo_fear|> As someone with sinus and breathing problems, this makes me anxious and short of breath just looking at it."
<|emo_sad|> But...but...I just bought a new gun in Fallout '76.....and America is the centre of the universe!! :'(
<|emo_anger|> I'd piss right on their floor. Fuck this.
"<|emo_surprise|> I've been into cuckolding for many years, and I'm wondering the same thing! "
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder the same thing. Where could I go where no one would ever find me. I usually come around to dropping myself in the millworks.
<|emo_sad|> This truly is the dankest timeline
<|emo_anger|> Your comment is completely irrelevant and you're trolling me in order for you to cry and whine about Detroit. Get out of here.
<|emo_disgust|> Censoring criticism and discussion is a very slippery slope.
"<|emo_surprise|> Haha! [NAME] aside, that is *wonderful*!"
<|emo_surprise|> I was wondering the same thing
<|emo_disgust|> Mark it nsfw just to mess with people. Worst title I have seen all week.
<|emo_disgust|> Umm... educated people who think that killing a fetus after viability is abhorrent?
<|emo_joy|> i thought it was very coincidental that i was listening to 808’s while doing this bullshit and that this question popped up unexpectedly. made me smile
<|emo_sad|> Don't know how that was missed. Tragic really. Considering the title.
"<|emo_disgust|> Say what you want about me, I can take it... but stop slandering poor defenseless [NAME]..."
<|emo_sad|> The DNC effectively *was* lead by [NAME]... That was the problem.
<|emo_joy|> Happy birthday [NAME]
<|emo_sad|> Yet here you are mad about [NAME] being apathetic.
<|emo_disgust|> He was horrible
<|emo_sad|> I miss him...
<|emo_sad|> I’m genuinely surprised that [NAME] didn’t believe [NAME] lipstick speech - like that shit genuinely moved me
<|emo_anger|> You're disgusting
<|emo_anger|> my crush began to be annoying when i lost interest in him. it sucks either way
<|emo_joy|> I used to have fun with it and didn't feel angry aside for when [NAME] was op lol
<|emo_sad|> Why am I crying alone in my room rn
<|emo_sad|> It's hard to start over. I wish you happiness.
<|emo_anger|> make those damn lazy millennials find a job sooner /s
<|emo_anger|> Well you're lying about my pun being better bitch
"<|emo_joy|> I'm glad for that. Once that check comes in, I only have about $3000 to work with."
<|emo_anger|> Oy vey! Shut it down!
"<|emo_joy|> Ahhhh [NAME], you’ve done it again."
<|emo_fear|> Don't stay too long or you might go Nakamoto : P
<|emo_joy|> I enjoyed this nearly as much as I enjoy too many pints.
"<|emo_surprise|> What a horrible way to find out, though. My sympathies to the dead man."
<|emo_anger|> If men were that aggressive we’d be arrested and then slammed publicly and socially. Lives ruined for a moment of drunken stupor.
<|emo_fear|> This is creepy.
"<|emo_sad|> What a loser, sad. "
<|emo_sad|> This sounds rough
"<|emo_sad|> Your welcome and I know what you mean. Whenever I feel sad, our dogs would come to me and they would either lick or lie with me. "
<|emo_fear|> I love the way you phrased that. I do believe she is terribly afraid to look inward at herself.
"<|emo_joy|> Mate, you're proving my point."
<|emo_sad|> Oh I didn't know. Please give me his P.O. Box address so I can submit them immediately. Cause I am definitely uninterested in blowing out my intestines.
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad :)
<|emo_joy|> cutest vid I've seen in a while
<|emo_joy|> Posting someone elses camp on reddit? Really? haha.
<|emo_joy|> That was fun.
<|emo_joy|> Sonic boom is funny as hell. I love the writing so much.
"<|emo_disgust|> "" [NAME] has come down with a terrible sickness which caused him to deactivate his twitter account"" Jeez sicknesses these days get worse and worse. "
"<|emo_surprise|> That has some amusingly unfortunate implications for those that believe all [NAME] are descendant from [NAME], son of [NAME] and [NAME]. "
<|emo_joy|> To me he's extremely funny. Love him.
<|emo_anger|> That’s a fuckin budgie. You gotta be a moron at birds to not know that. That’s like Bird Basics 101.
<|emo_disgust|> Weird headline. 2 children per mother would be expected to shrink the population.
<|emo_disgust|> Here too. I just find weird colorful stuff and hope it doesn't clash too bad.
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] pretty famous for that. I love the show but there is an entire episode that is blatant anti-nuclear energy fear mongering.
<|emo_fear|> This is why I’m afraid to fly.
<|emo_surprise|> That dress is made with industrial strength lycra/polyester and thread. I'm amazed it didn't blow up and kill innocent bystanders at the restaurant.
"<|emo_anger|> If I ever see that in my area, that will be a bullet to the head. Fuck Reddit's rules."
<|emo_joy|> I also love this decline in bch prices. Cheers.
<|emo_surprise|> Nice job. I'm surprised not a single one of them used their CC immune ults or had beads. That is usually really important in assault.
"<|emo_joy|> I stand corrected. As I said, wonderful charities. I will always enjoy GDQ, just not revalant to my experience."
<|emo_joy|> I always cry when [NAME] is on screen.
"<|emo_joy|> its all fun, until one pissed off owner with a lot of money to burn files tampering charges against [NAME] and [NAME], and takes them to court"
<|emo_disgust|> Boring way to get it and unfair with the rest of the pkayers
<|emo_fear|> This is scary.
"<|emo_joy|> Though I encourage! For an opportunity to play a game of such grand anticipation as this, is a sweet fortune."
<|emo_anger|> They are angry virgin children because he plays the game like it was supposed to be played. SOT has the most pathetic community ever.
"<|emo_joy|> I love it, made me smile. Glad he is helping out animal friends!"
"<|emo_sad|> Too bad we couldn't elect a good leader in 2016...instead we got a bum. Oh well, [NAME] is finished. [NAME] 2020 "
<|emo_disgust|> Shame our government can't progress as fast as the infrastructure.
<|emo_disgust|> This is garbage. No. My garbage has more compositional worth than this. Hipster pepto bismol vomit looking trash.
<|emo_disgust|> That was awesome. the gross spin by [NAME] and the one legged glider by [NAME]. beautiful
"<|emo_surprise|> Yup, it's pretty funny to know we technically use the metric system."
<|emo_joy|> I'm concerned with optimal health. Not surviving.
<|emo_sad|> Rip the guy from psych
<|emo_disgust|> Oh....yuck
<|emo_surprise|> Didn't even know we were in the running. I thought if he leaves Chelsea he's only going to real ;)
"<|emo_anger|> DWIGHT, NEVER YELL AT THE CUSTOMERS"
"<|emo_sad|> sadly it would take wayyyyyy more than this to ever change custody agreements. documenting it for her own sanity is a good idea, though."
<|emo_sad|> This hurts my brain
"<|emo_disgust|> I hope your brother is okay. Don’t listen to this guy, he’s a cunt."
<|emo_surprise|> This is dumb. Why is Detroit Lions infiltrating here.
<|emo_joy|> Hope you had fun atleast; it's amazing to see up close in person compared to the camera.
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh no, the horror. Look, a pause! Let's start CPR! Those nurses, probably"
<|emo_joy|> I was inspired by your post to grab a thing of Greek yogurt with pineapple I've got in the fridge. Hell yeah.
<|emo_disgust|> this has happened to me twice...most embarrassing shit
"<|emo_disgust|> Can I just say that the Elizabeth Line is still a bloody stupid name, and no I don't think I'll just get used to it."
<|emo_surprise|> Why do all the animals look terrifying oh god oh fuck
<|emo_joy|> So glad you got justice and closure. You can properly begin to heal now. I’m not sure I ever will get the same sadly
<|emo_surprise|> And...peter thiel is involved. Color me surprised. (O negative surprised that is.)
"<|emo_disgust|> If a woman forces a man's penis into her vagina, that ABSOLUTELY IS a crime. Not sure what you're smoking. "
"<|emo_sad|> Rejection always hurts, even just a little. Sparing her feelings may mean she doesn't get the meaning. Be direct, kind, but direct. "
<|emo_anger|> Let this be a lesson at how easily manipulated some therapist are. Block the therapist immediately. He/she has been compromised by a psychopath.
<|emo_sad|> i wish it was 2 hours :(
"<|emo_anger|> Hmm, were you trying to prove your inability to read, or just your inability to comprehend? Either way, you've effectively done so."
"<|emo_surprise|> OHHHH, I like where Richmond is going with that."
<|emo_joy|> You are very welcome. Happy growing. Keep in touch with your success.
<|emo_surprise|> where did they even find that photo
"<|emo_surprise|> Well, I bought cheese when I went, and was shocked at the great variety and lower prices. That probably skewed my view."
"<|emo_joy|> Wow, that's cool!"
<|emo_anger|> I hate text speak . Do you really want to dumb down your argument more than you need to?
<|emo_sad|> This obviously led to your slow downward spiral into apostasy. The spirit never returned after skymall destroyed your testimony. 😜
<|emo_disgust|> Calling people on the internet “sweetie”... sweet [NAME] I love this sub. The cringe hurts so good.
<|emo_disgust|> I mean it sucks but that man looks deaded
<|emo_surprise|> Surprise my what now?
<|emo_joy|> I recently won a match going 12/19. Always ends the same way you thanking them profusely and them being slightly annoyed.
<|emo_anger|> FOR THE PEOPLE
"<|emo_joy|> On this blessed day, we are all KQLY."
<|emo_anger|> What kind of response is that it's so shit
"<|emo_anger|> That's the problem I'm pointing, the media use stupid clicbait names and people get dumber and dumber."
<|emo_sad|> Plot twist: the customer just found she's diabetic and that's why she's crying.
<|emo_disgust|> That Facebook post was too loud.
"<|emo_sad|> Whew lad they're bleeding employees, reminds me of [NAME] before they bit the dust"
<|emo_sad|> That windshield crack from his skull!
<|emo_disgust|> Shame..
<|emo_disgust|> Omg this is repulsive
<|emo_sad|> Thanks haha. I really do feel sorry for my friend here... At least the group he accidentally asked is pretty much all furries
<|emo_fear|> It’s pretty cringe
<|emo_sad|> Sad because you don't get any women?
<|emo_anger|> Thank you! In Germany and was sick of waiting and wondering
<|emo_surprise|> Oh no atleast you found out early. I went to find help a year ago but you know i stopped going to that therapist
<|emo_fear|> Acne scars unfortunately and also out of anxiety I tend to pick at my skin.
<|emo_sad|> Everyone is sad on this sub dont take it personally if you don't get any replies.
<|emo_disgust|> Weird how they shoehorned s character from an ongoing tv show into Celebrity Big Brothter. Glad they got rid of him after one episode though.
<|emo_sad|> He most likely saw you and just didn’t care. Sadly.
<|emo_joy|> Well glad she got out of the situation safely. I would much rather NOT have to investigate and know someone is safe.
<|emo_joy|> Went on a trip to the Austin area. This park is nice if you haven’t been there. Subscribe if you can. Enjoy
<|emo_anger|> That troll and his Kotaku cronies have no shame. None at all.
"<|emo_joy|> Going through a divorce right now. Her saying ""I love you and maybe we should go to counseling"" would make me more than happy."
"<|emo_sad|> Oh sorry, i thought you were having a dig at him lol. "
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] damn it, I knew something was wrong, oh well."
<|emo_surprise|> Dementia is in my family so this is pretty exciting. I also have to wonder if this bacteria could cause other kinds of mental illnesses..
<|emo_fear|> But but r/49ers said it was just bad luck!
<|emo_anger|> You’re not being used but she has no right to tell you what to do with your money.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow that's just like when I sing it
"<|emo_fear|> In that case, I’m appalled. "
<|emo_disgust|> yesterday was a fucking travesty to the game of basketball
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you weren't instantly downvoted hundreds of times. The omniscum must have had a salad once and got a protein deficancy."
<|emo_surprise|> Yelling that to them seems correct. Did they respond?
"<|emo_anger|> I got the same call, voicemail was definitely Chinese but I deleted it and marked the number as Spam/Blocked "
"<|emo_disgust|> wow that’s really some hate there. I hated [NAME] in the Office too, but he got okay since the third run"
<|emo_fear|> Trust me man. Don't see it. It's scarring.
<|emo_surprise|> No it takes at least 14 days and if she’s had her period it’s very unlikely she was pregnant before NYE
<|emo_joy|> Wow. Good thing [NAME] are known for having ample savings since our country treats the average worker so well.
"<|emo_surprise|> Omg. I just noticed that! Holy fuck, how does she smell?"
<|emo_sad|> That guy who melodramatically dances around playing horribly soppy poppy chord progressions over and over and does a cringy dance that makes me want to kill things?
<|emo_joy|> Enjoying it. It makes shaving my head easier.
<|emo_surprise|> What a cataclysm
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] please no
<|emo_surprise|> A bag of pita chips is really $8?
<|emo_anger|> THINK OF THE😤😤😤GENERATIONS OF NEWS🇺🇸😞🇺🇸THAT GETS LOST WHEN THESE YOUNG UNS 👲👲👹STOP LOVING NEWS📰PAPERS I FOR ONE🇺🇸😎🇺🇸SUPPORT OUR NEWS📰PAPER INDUSTRY🇺🇸🏭🇺🇸
"<|emo_joy|> This movie was awesome, what’s wrong with you? I’m sure the next one is gonna be totally rad."
"<|emo_anger|> Trust me, you can anthropomorphize anything and fuck it. Or at least, that’s what the internet has taught me."
"<|emo_disgust|> Been there, done that. Not the best idea unfortunately. Especially if it doesn't work. Gets awkward "
<|emo_sad|> The bot did its job. It’s me the awful one
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. Yeah I’m very new, only about 8 hours gameplay"
<|emo_anger|> What the heck?!
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] I hate Twitter
<|emo_surprise|> *geez oh man my father was a mailman*
<|emo_surprise|> This is genius
<|emo_anger|> ... [NAME] derangement syndrome sufferer spotted. What drivel you crazy lunatics say... The lies and falsehoods along with the out of place fearmongering is getting really annoying...
"<|emo_anger|> Your wife just proved to your son that her love for him is not unconditional. She sounds ignorant, hateful, and should get therapy or get out."
<|emo_surprise|> Confound your toll Troll!
<|emo_surprise|> huh i didn’t even know that button existed
"<|emo_anger|> They don’t like him, so he is divisive. It’s projection."
<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit!!
<|emo_joy|> If you're going out with a big group then this doesn't seem so bad. Everyone gets something to eat and it's fun.
<|emo_sad|> I wish I could believe in myself
"<|emo_sad|> Unfortunately, the DM is [NAME]."
<|emo_surprise|> *dramatic anime gasp* impossible!
"<|emo_fear|> It may be weird, but I replay the entire series while waiting for another episode all the time."
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah he's a cunt but that doesn't mean he should be prosecuted for a joke. No matter how bad taste it was.
"<|emo_disgust|> 2000 kid, know cursive but really badly. I have old notebooks that are barely legible because of my cursive lol"
<|emo_sad|> The sad thing is that most of them are gone the next election anyway.
<|emo_anger|> I’m always weirded out whenever I see him without a beard because in my game I got the longest beard I could
"<|emo_disgust|> Honestly, this would creep me out a bit."
<|emo_joy|> well i’m proud of you and that’s awesome
<|emo_anger|> Drive thru is the worst. The number of times people would sneeze in my face at the window was infuriating.
<|emo_disgust|> What an abusive piece of crap. Those poor boys won’t know how to be adults. I hope their father is in their lives.
<|emo_surprise|> Ah the infamous [NAME]. How I've suppressed that name from my memory.... Until now
"<|emo_joy|> I like to believe he faked his own death, so he can enjoy his many Bitcoin coins and wealth. "
<|emo_anger|> Worst in the country by far.
<|emo_joy|> Group hug to you and our fellow redditors :)
<|emo_joy|> Omg! That's awesome thank you so much!
<|emo_sad|> I’m too poor to watch this 🙈😂
<|emo_joy|> I’m desperate for it. I once got to lie in bed with a girl friend a couple times. That was cool. But we barely touched.
<|emo_joy|> YOU WIN!
<|emo_joy|> I was expecting the top comment to be the copypasta. Glad to see that wasn’t the case.
"<|emo_joy|> Pressure 7 targets/10 targets, popcorn, any tracking, and any tile frenzy because I enjoy trying to beat my highscore"
<|emo_joy|> i'm enjoying this so much
<|emo_sad|> Little did you know 95% of these kids just don’t want to go to school
<|emo_joy|> I used to love to mix addys and Valium 10s though lol!
<|emo_surprise|> Can’t believe [NAME] era is coming to an end... feels like yesterday I saw his 1st win against the cowboys with tiki breaking the rushing record.
<|emo_joy|> the most romantic thing that can possibly happen to me
<|emo_anger|> I still hated the system though. I felt penalized for using anything that wasn't the power beam the entire game.
<|emo_surprise|> That helps. I would've never guessed you'd style mannequins.
<|emo_sad|> In the comments he accuses the account of being fake and she proves her identity with photos and a link to her instagram. This guy is astoundingly pathetic.
<|emo_disgust|> His hair looks fucking horrible 😂
<|emo_sad|> That guy is gonna regret losing you the rest of his life. You know why i know this? Because i am him 30 years ago.
<|emo_sad|> it is dangerous to date men - read the news - women get killed by male partners and ex partners very frequently. Women are amazingly brave.
<|emo_disgust|> Yawn. They’re toxic together and their only trait seemed to be getting naked together.
<|emo_anger|> Any more comments calling me SWERF for caring about sex workers will be blocked and reported I s2g
<|emo_sad|> I might be in trouble in this case. I have 7 years going on 8 :(
<|emo_sad|> Both parents were drunk. Where were the small children? You helped her cheat and possibly contribute to child neglect. Awesome.
<|emo_sad|> My wife with BPD hasn't even kissed me in over a year. Get used to it if you're sticking around.
<|emo_fear|> we are scared on /r/bengals rn
"<|emo_joy|> thanks mate! I haven’t given that idea much thought, i’ll give it a shot next time i’m home"
<|emo_anger|> They've all fucked your mother. Just ask them.
<|emo_joy|> ? sometimes i play ffa with my friends to have fun
<|emo_surprise|> Omfg the worst!! want to pull my hair out!!
<|emo_joy|> I loved it so much more than I thought I would! [NAME] does an amazing job with quite a bizarre concept!
<|emo_disgust|> I kinda like the swirlies in the hair. But then I saw that her eyebrow is actually just the hair and hated it.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME]!
<|emo_joy|> That was awesome. Momentum is really something isn't it?
<|emo_fear|> My son brings *homework* from kindergarten. I feel betrayed.
<|emo_disgust|> Just read the text of this amendment. I am literally sick to my stomach from reading this. THIS MUST NOT STAND!!
<|emo_anger|> When bear attacks kick him I'm the ball!
"<|emo_anger|> I have no idea what's going on, but I hate when people surround the car like that. "
<|emo_surprise|> Shocking isn’t it
"<|emo_joy|> No, she is my ex from a long time ago and we are still good mates"
"<|emo_anger|> Oh. So you are actually full of shit. Okay, noted. Thanks."
"<|emo_disgust|> You’re disgusting. I hope your wife finds somebody much, much better than you."
<|emo_joy|> Maybe we'll just stop moderating for a while to celebrate TWOW.
<|emo_anger|> Mine is 2.5 and trying to drop her last nap. She needs it so desperately though. It is HELLLLLL dealing with this.
<|emo_fear|> They're so scared
<|emo_fear|> When your 16 and do adderall and get a panic attack
"<|emo_sad|> Wow, I'm sorry you had to deal with that. I trust better things are coming for you. "
"<|emo_anger|> Self defense should be, and this man sexually assaulted this woman."
<|emo_sad|> Man i was so sad when i found out vodka had calories
"<|emo_surprise|> I admit, I cackled. I am now wondering how to get this printed on an enamel pin with a tiny Fury in a power suit."
<|emo_disgust|> They killed [NAME] for being a [NAME] right after this. [NAME] was a notorious anti-Semite.
<|emo_sad|> She better not die
"<|emo_sad|> IMO, cheaters are only sorry they got caught, not because they betrayed their spouses and had an affair. "
<|emo_disgust|> The jackets that we have so many people wore so they’re musty as hell
<|emo_disgust|> > its exactly the opposite of what I do to get a girl in the mood This is super creepy
<|emo_anger|> Players like this makes me rage quit tbh.
"<|emo_sad|> It's a dumb and harmful thing, when you invite people because of their race and sexual orientation over qualifications and skill"
<|emo_joy|> ¯_(ツ)_/¯ I think its cool.
<|emo_anger|> Intolerance of intolerance isn't intolerant my dude
"<|emo_anger|>  Don't be so stupid. Terrorism is inherently political, religion is just one of the tools used to carry it out. "
<|emo_surprise|> I was thinking it’s sad that a team that hasn’t had a FRP for what seems like a decade has a better record than us.
<|emo_fear|> Tear all of it down - that place is such a horrific example of trash civil engineering
<|emo_anger|> We also blame their money
"<|emo_sad|> It was a terrible, terrible thing to do. He did every day of his time for it, has expressed regret, and has not repeated it."
"<|emo_joy|> Also here's my starting point on the right, obviously, for my bulk."
<|emo_surprise|> 25000 likes wow! I got max. 30-35 likes.
<|emo_joy|> I’m also glad I’m not the only one that swears a lot at the bastard objects.
<|emo_anger|> I'm leaving to go get some more motherfucking jokes MOM [NAME]
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is my least favorite on the station.
<|emo_fear|> Please leave this dude
"<|emo_anger|> Worst case, Grab an Uber or Lyft to another dealership."
<|emo_disgust|> That’s downright creepy. It’s as if he’s testing if $50 will keep you quiet if he does inappropriate things.
"<|emo_joy|> Dark Crystal, Neverending Story, Labyrinth. My holy trinity of movies I both loved and was intimidated by as a child."
"<|emo_disgust|> ""Oh, how DARE you discuss the disgustingly unhealthy and dangerous lifestyle I pursue!"" /s"
<|emo_sad|> Ouch! That hit hard
"<|emo_disgust|> People date who they find attractive, and fuck who they find attractive. That’s it."
<|emo_joy|> I'm so glad you got your angel back. Also she is trying to monopolize DHs free time.
<|emo_surprise|> Guess I hit a triple
<|emo_surprise|> Mother of [NAME]... Im not grossed out very easily. I can stomach just about anything. But this made my fucking skin crawl....
<|emo_surprise|> >as a part-time Knicks fan Join us! Become a full-time Nuggs fan!
<|emo_joy|> Thank you! I'm so glad you liked it! I did finally get a new belt lol
<|emo_joy|> I read this silently to myself yet everyone around started clapping because of this kid
"<|emo_fear|> You know when I typed ""legal tender"" I had a horrible feeling I was going down a rabbit hole."
<|emo_anger|> I'm so triggered!!!!!!! Please stop you are hurting us with your comments!?!?!?!?!?
<|emo_joy|> The workers are going hoooome
"<|emo_disgust|> I would love to be cut open for no reason while I miss work spending weeks, and possibly even years, recovering!"
<|emo_joy|> great for on the go! but i’ll always smoke glass if i’m home :)
"<|emo_joy|> Happiness is not earned, it is a choice that can be made once your basic needs are met."
<|emo_sad|> This is so sad. #playdespacito
<|emo_fear|> That looks like you need to go to the hospital ASAP or you'll lose a limb and possibly more.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow if ur mom didn’t come back for her card you were a goner crazy
"<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised they play the national anthem at derby bouts there, been to many bouts in Minnesota and haven't once heard the national anthem performed."
<|emo_fear|> Thanks. I was leaning towards the 11:05 tourney at MGM since it's deeper stack and slightly longer blind levels.
"<|emo_sad|> My bad, I guess I should've read the whole thing, from opiate yes "
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow Toxicity has been done thousands of times, becoming less and less original, try something new. NEXT! "
<|emo_surprise|> Yeah - thanks - I vaguely remember this. I wonder what her net worth was year by year? Too lazy to investigate.
<|emo_anger|> Damn. That’s profound. Did you graduate from Harvard?

<|emo_anger|> YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH WHEN YOU’RE TALKIN’ TO ME!
"<|emo_joy|> No problem at all, glad I could help :) Cheers!"
<|emo_disgust|> Bit odd because plan B was exactly the same as plan A.
<|emo_joy|> No matter which you pick ([NAME] or [NAME]) the dance and the date scenes were great. It genuinely makes me happy seeing [NAME] happy.
<|emo_surprise|> Omg is this that what older kids call s*x?1?1??1??
"<|emo_surprise|> Technically, if [NAME] are right about him, then you already did nail him... soooooo..."

<|emo_anger|> Eat my fuck- [NAME]
<|emo_joy|> I would not be surprised seeing as both picked up [NAME] and the other [NAME].
<|emo_fear|> Creepiest building in Chicago. I couldn’t even imagine the number of gunshot victims that have gone theough those doors and came out in a body bag.
<|emo_fear|> I was afraid of that .
"<|emo_joy|> My favorite so far is ""national emergency declares national emergency."""
<|emo_disgust|> As a society we should be ashamed of the fact that this is even a question. Let the suffering stop obviously.
<|emo_anger|> The problem with that it would show how the comics end and people would hate that
"<|emo_surprise|> You too! (FYI I accidentally initially replied in a new comment, in case you didn’t see my other reply)"
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry man, you’re a great person and all. But margarine??? Downvoted*"
<|emo_fear|> ~~Comrade~~ [NAME] I'm appalled that you would accuse me of using performance enhancing drugs. Neigh! Neigh I say!

"<|emo_surprise|> Not related, but now I wonder how Delta would have done on the hair ball challenge"
"<|emo_anger|> simply reply ""no."" sometimes youve gotta be rude."
<|emo_sad|> Oh no!
<|emo_fear|> This post and thread are killing me
<|emo_joy|> This is hilarious! Sounds similar to my buddy's experience at his gym in CoHeights!
<|emo_surprise|> That’s awesome! Hopefully the sanity keeps up
"<|emo_anger|> When the gov shut down under [NAME] many were calling for his resignation. This is similar, but people already hate [NAME] so obviously people are more angry."
<|emo_anger|> Fuck sake man
"<|emo_joy|> Hope you enjoy it! Try not to leave it too long though, it's been taken down before. "
<|emo_joy|> It is so refreshing to have [NAME] gone.
<|emo_fear|> The idea that fb might be slowly killing mlms out there gives me a glimmer of satisfaction...
"<|emo_sad|> Luckily, everyone regrets MySpace. "
<|emo_anger|> Anyone who fell for the Lonzo hype from the beginning should slap themselves.
"<|emo_fear|> Yes, risky. In fact don't click it at all."
<|emo_anger|> Yeah but they actully had/have shit to be mad about. Their board is incapable.
<|emo_disgust|> So get a job and leave. It's just going to get worse. First the tv then you. Get out while you can
<|emo_anger|> I think this title is biased. It groups all media improperly.

"<|emo_sad|> Oh, gotcha. I have a friend with unipolar depression who does have memory issues, so yes, that can happen during depression too."
"<|emo_joy|> Yay, now we're only down by 7"

<|emo_sad|> I have trouble even remembering what true happiness feels like
<|emo_disgust|> So. Damn. Greasy.
<|emo_sad|> Dang the charge heavy down from 60 is brutal. Poor [NAME]

"<|emo_sad|> No, it's not. If they grow in the wrong way then they can become extremely painful and cause discomfort. People usually like chewing freely"
<|emo_joy|> I enjoy that general area. Sections 203-205 are good sections pricewide and view wise
"<|emo_fear|> 2 Minute [NAME] is the scariest [NAME]. I fear they have yet again, like the regular season game, scored too soon."
<|emo_disgust|> That specific block is probably one of the worst in the city.
<|emo_anger|> I’m offended that your offended
<|emo_surprise|> So glad to hear they got banned. Can't believe adults can still behave like that.
"<|emo_disgust|> I mean, he is a terrible president. "
<|emo_fear|> Mini sun because rain pouring on you constantly will ruin everything around you like electronics
"<|emo_sad|> Even if you think me and him aren't soulmates, youve gotta be pretty sad to think soulmates don't exist. "
<|emo_sad|> Is the Queen movie bad? That makes me sad. I'm still watch it anyway.
<|emo_surprise|> It looks like they do but random redditors do not. What a surprise.
"<|emo_surprise|> I’m really late here, but I’m surprised I haven’t seen anyone bring up the possibility of them wanting to eat you."
<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry for you... That sounds not cool :'(
<|emo_sad|> You wont be in pain but you wont feel any relief either. Find what makes you feel comfortable and stick with it
<|emo_disgust|> Bad timing for [NAME] to say this just now.
<|emo_fear|> A better description would be she got a nasty fright rather than it being terrifying.
"<|emo_disgust|> But the battle dynamics are sh*t. Every other ME is better in that respect, especially the squad AI is bad. Really bad."
<|emo_disgust|> The brick details actually look good. Everything else - ehhhhhh.
<|emo_sad|> A the_donald poster trying to pass as a human being has to be one of the saddest things I've ever seen.
<|emo_joy|> Same. Glad it's not just out store.
<|emo_joy|> I like that we get to see how varied artists are.
<|emo_sad|> Because the hierarchy is afraid they’ll get burned.

<|emo_joy|> We're all [NAME] fans in our hearts
<|emo_anger|> Two horrible cunts
<|emo_surprise|> I turned the game off last night wondering what it’s like to have two point guards and being slightly jealous of the Nets.
"<|emo_surprise|> as long as the tracking shows delivered, it's not your responsibility what happens to it after that"
<|emo_sad|> I hope you’re okay! I’m so sorry that happened. I’m glad I don’t work in gastown anymore
<|emo_disgust|> This sounds like disgusting wasp propaganda. You're being paid by Big Wasp aren't you? Confess!
<|emo_disgust|> YES. Thanks man. Now I can feel less weird about my 20-year long passive aggressive rivalry with my sister. That means a lot.
<|emo_disgust|> I’d say this is spot on. He’s not sorry he hurt me. He just wants me to shut up.
"<|emo_surprise|> I'm wondering how many players have ""PhD In Punishment"" -comment unironically."
<|emo_fear|> Y'all ever try to ride a scooter with one hand before? Shit was dangerous.
<|emo_surprise|> 37?? He looks 47. Hard life...drugs and alcohol.
<|emo_anger|> I suspect wilful idiocy to sell books and merchandise to the even more idiotic.
<|emo_joy|> I’d go back to the 1996 season. That’s the last time we were in crazy cold territory.
<|emo_sad|> Possible sad tyre
<|emo_joy|> And then you got a little vacation from work too! :D
<|emo_anger|> The guy is seriously neurotic.
"<|emo_fear|> Yessir, it gives me the creeps. That boy ain't in Scotland, and that boy ain't right."
"<|emo_fear|> Depends on the drug. Weed makes me antisocial and when I'm in public, I feel paranoid and I feel like everyone knows I'm high."
<|emo_anger|> Surprised [NAME] didn't add his hatred of interracial couples in the movie.
<|emo_sad|> My nuts hurt watching that second part
<|emo_joy|> Glad to have you here :)
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh I didn't even see that at first! I thought it was just a clipboard, but you've found a second angle! "
"<|emo_anger|> What bothers me is not the fact that someone disagrees with my lifestyle, it's that they constantly go on and on about..that would annoy anyone."
<|emo_sad|> I know! Or close the door of the room where the baby is sleeping? It's too sad for the poor thing to be locked inside.
"<|emo_anger|> Boston sports doesn’t deserve anymore titles, fuck the pats"
<|emo_surprise|> Hey what a coincidence so is a human head!
<|emo_anger|> Worst dad ever!
<|emo_fear|> Losing to cruz azul smh
<|emo_sad|> Nice! I missed the Babybel.
"<|emo_surprise|> They say nature makes man feel small, but I wasn't expecting this"
<|emo_surprise|> Oh heck owo
"<|emo_joy|> I waited 15 days for this joke, I'm so proud of this community."
<|emo_disgust|> Twice in that article he implies these minority communities aren't ordinary [NAME]. It's disgusting.
"<|emo_anger|> Well, if that's how you always are, I can't imagine even wanting to be next you let alone have deer like sex with you."
"<|emo_anger|> Stop, your hurting me!"
<|emo_joy|> I love that OP “loved” his insult. It’s like the ultimate slap in the face to this CB.
<|emo_anger|> Hated her. And that was honestly a more offensive reaction than everyone laughing at her IMHO
<|emo_disgust|> My mom works for Nasa and apparently no. They gave them pamphlets with numbers for credit agencies and tips on getting loans lol. Its kinda awful.
<|emo_anger|> Tell him he needs to go to rehab or he’ll be kicked out.
<|emo_joy|> Glad to hear it's ubiquitous and not an OS thing.
<|emo_surprise|> Turns out they weren't wrong about [NAME] either
<|emo_joy|> You mean your WolfDog Hybrids? Kidding.
<|emo_anger|> Shitpost from the uncultured

<|emo_joy|> I'd steal that!... just as cool.
<|emo_surprise|> OmG pEyToN iSn'T gOoD eNoUgH tO hElP uS iN tHe PlAyOfFs! Dumbass Broncos fans circa December 2015.
<|emo_sad|> I almost didn't finish this stranger mission because I just *knew* it was going to be bad.
<|emo_anger|> Yeah I just want the damn photos.
<|emo_fear|> Oh my [NAME] stop
<|emo_surprise|> Was getting ready to comment about this one. Was really surprised how much I liked it but can see why it’s not for everyone
"<|emo_joy|> Ironically, everyone else (except a v small%) are thinking the same, try keeping this in mind next time.. enjoy your day"
<|emo_fear|> I cringed and flinched. That’s a bad day
<|emo_disgust|> Her face looks like a damn frog to me - and the way she has one eye closed; an evil one eyed frog!
<|emo_anger|> Yet another clown whining about discussions about bitcoin in a bitcoin sub.
<|emo_disgust|> He doesnt deserve the wage he's probably demanding for them to say no thanks. no injury prone and inconsistent for that.
<|emo_joy|> Yes!! THANK YOU. I’m happy the point of this story was not lost among all.
<|emo_disgust|> Reacting to [NAME] at this point just makes me feel worse about the artist.
<|emo_anger|> Zionism is the ISIS of [RELIGION]. Brainwashed idiots like ISIS.
<|emo_joy|> Remember the year “Song 2” was number 2? Good times.
<|emo_joy|> Cool story bro!
<|emo_sad|> No stop. One Red and yellow team had to be sacrificed for the fortunes of the other. I’m sorry
<|emo_sad|> I’ll never be able to unsee this.
<|emo_disgust|> Another racist foul by the Raptors on [NAME]
"<|emo_joy|> I agree with this. I'm extremely happy with the hires, but I think the draft may be a bigger tell tale on how the off-season goes."
"<|emo_disgust|> Good read man, sounds like a crazy time, its the worst vomiting red in front of ramdom people lmfao 😂"
"<|emo_surprise|> omg you got me, what do i do now, pls help"
<|emo_joy|> You really going to claim our foreign policy is equivalent to that of Iran and Russia?
<|emo_disgust|> No clip? Screenshot? Picture at all? Sounds fake as hell
"<|emo_disgust|> The snapchat news feed on the stories page is horrendous, its entirely just celebs, porn and hookup culture shit. "
<|emo_sad|> Haha sorry I’m still pretty clueless about this app
<|emo_anger|> Trolls are not even trying anymore. Im offended by this half arsed attempt to get a rise out of me..
"<|emo_disgust|> Grr big company BAD ""They can afford it"""
"<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit, if my siblings had roomates i wouldnt be shocked if you were talking about them."
"<|emo_disgust|> For me, it's tedious and frustrating enough to do it the first time, but I'm glad you enjoy it"
<|emo_surprise|> Wow! That's awesome! Congratulations! Its wonderful to have hope of being off medications one day.
"<|emo_anger|> Your mistake, you should've waited outside, he just followed the app right to you."
"<|emo_joy|> Atheist here and I believe in freedom of religion, don’t let ppl get in ur head, believe in what makes you happy"
<|emo_surprise|> You know I asked once and he was livid. But sometimes I wonder.
"<|emo_joy|> $42,000 fine over a JOKE is unreasonable. "
<|emo_joy|> Hahah you right. Please don't tell any birds!
"<|emo_joy|> Come on, New Day! Make it finally finally happen, [NAME]!"
<|emo_disgust|> Haha! Yeah scentsy is terrible!
<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid I'm gonna have to go with what he said about an hour ago. Unicorns. He just ruled out any sort of
<|emo_sad|> I was thinking it’s sad that a team that hasn’t had a FRP for what seems like a decade has a better record than us.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow did you really just scam me😔
"<|emo_surprise|> Considering my wife barely touches me, I think I could get this job. Wonder how much it pays. "
<|emo_joy|> *Hey just noticed..* it's your **5th Cakeday** [NAME]! ^(hug)
<|emo_anger|> Can you freak bitchhhhh
<|emo_surprise|> I used to build a ramp and jump over other kids on my bike ala [NAME]... I was amazed at the time.
"<|emo_joy|> Nihilism makes me happy, but I know that’s just my opinion."
<|emo_anger|> Fucking refs suck my balls.
<|emo_anger|> How dare you put x on the same level as [NAME] and [NAME] [NAME] that's disgusting
<|emo_surprise|> This man looks so much older without the cap
<|emo_anger|> Well that sucks lmao
<|emo_anger|> Your friend should be disowned by their family
<|emo_joy|> Oh I wish that was how everyone thought. Unfortunately it's not.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, what a controversial opinion."
<|emo_anger|> Especially that “Australia ain’t gonna cop it” ad on TV god I hate [NAME]
"<|emo_anger|> Yeah, life in America is horrifying. Give me a break. "
<|emo_surprise|> uhh guys love natural beauty in a partner but the random effort is like a cool surprise
<|emo_anger|> 11 years goddamit I’m old
<|emo_surprise|> Oh neat! I didn't realize you guys shot it. I figured the company had set up a tripod. In that case I retract my complaint.
"<|emo_fear|> I know I should be worried, but I am not, which makes me very worried. "
<|emo_fear|> Damn she might have actually had a stroke if she started panicking
<|emo_surprise|> You again.
"<|emo_fear|> This is me all the time, a mixture of anxiety and dread."
<|emo_joy|> My favourite scene in the movie.
<|emo_anger|> Shut up cowpoke
<|emo_disgust|> that was a horrible fix
"<|emo_disgust|> That's not a healthy way of thinking. Obviously that dude was troubled and, without proper help, he would have done these things regardless."
<|emo_sad|> I would be more offended to be served cereal on a plate.
<|emo_joy|> Thank you! :)
<|emo_joy|> Spice Burger. Delicious!

<|emo_joy|> MR. STEAL YO' GIRL!
"<|emo_anger|> For the people and finding out how they end up? Sure. Other than that, it’s not great. Frustrating at best. "
<|emo_fear|> I would be afraid he would come back and somehow blame me for his failure.
<|emo_fear|> Cheese Most of my friends love cheese so much that I’m scared to tell them that I can barely even bring myself to eat it
"<|emo_disgust|> Not sure wether to downvote because it's bad, or upvotes because that's the point"
"<|emo_joy|> Remember, we still have freakin' Alaska"
"<|emo_disgust|> The finest example of an egotistical, ignorant and racist piece of trash. Humans like this disgust me."
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] so much hate.
"<|emo_joy|> What Da?!?!?!! Welp, ya learn something new!!!! Damn!!!!"
<|emo_disgust|> The planet is being destroyed. ***yEaH bUt TaXaTiOn Is ThEfT!***
"<|emo_anger|> Your mom is putting actual effort into having a relationship with you, you insufferable donut. "
"<|emo_anger|> Also, there's no point in having a job if it doesn't pay substantially more than the childcare costs."
<|emo_joy|> I will never understand why streaming is entertaining.
<|emo_surprise|> I can’t believe this blatant police brutality
<|emo_surprise|> You’re gonna let him go without unmasking him??
<|emo_surprise|> My daughter just took hers (and failed but not surprisingly). It cost her $125.00.
<|emo_disgust|> What a disgusting person she is
<|emo_joy|> Luckily he is not.
"<|emo_surprise|> Thanks for gping to the effort, but i would be surprised if he read it and gave it the chance he have trump. Pleasantly surprised, though."
<|emo_sad|> > It's a bad precedent to start once this community grows. Community does what?
<|emo_sad|> A few months ago I would have loved that idea. Hard pass now.
<|emo_sad|> A guy tried to do this in France after the French Revolution. Did not go well.
"<|emo_anger|> I love how nobody posting here to decry the buzzfeed article is using their actual accounts, they’re all throwaways. Cowards. Just like your felonious President."
"<|emo_anger|> Sphh, that was badass. I say that went well."
<|emo_joy|> ah ok gotcha. glad you guys looked even better when [NAME] left! always cool to see
<|emo_disgust|> Because they don’t want to pay for [NAME]
<|emo_joy|> That’s the most badass joke I’ve heard
<|emo_sad|> It’s harder when you have kids with the partner.
<|emo_joy|> the excitement when they all first come in always makes me happy
<|emo_joy|> Makes me very happy indeed.
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] awful.
"<|emo_sad|> This is sad but not cringe, I hope he finds someone to play with soon 😪"
<|emo_fear|> Heat back in the day. You would go in and there would be a horrible mix of Joop aftershave and Bourbon in the air.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I stand corrected, it's *even worse* than I thought!"
<|emo_surprise|> “So which one is she” “Uhhhhhhh.....”

<|emo_disgust|> Go take a shower your personality stinks
<|emo_fear|> Hey! I play the lottery every week-this will eventually affect me...

"<|emo_disgust|> It's not his fault, it's your wife's. Shes the one you need to be pissed at"
<|emo_disgust|> Fcking disgusting.
"<|emo_disgust|> The fact that you are questioning it, makes it even more worrysome. "
<|emo_disgust|> Ugh. Sounds awful. I’m sorry :(
<|emo_joy|> I freakin love this channel
"<|emo_surprise|> I can’t imagine choosing McD’s over Banh Mi, that’s just a complete lack of respect for your taste buds."
<|emo_sad|> I needed to read this because I felt so bad for this guy... I just can't imagine a long walk home in winter.
<|emo_anger|> When we actually executed [NAME] system we were killing it
<|emo_joy|> I think this is my favourite story of the year so far.
<|emo_joy|> Happy Another Day random strangers!

<|emo_joy|> I'd love him to get a pick6/scoop and score and chief slam on them
<|emo_sad|> he stopped talking to me 🤷🏼‍♀️
<|emo_sad|> I made friend with one of these scammers. After speaking to me he quit his job at that company. We still speak regularly over whatapp and facetime!
<|emo_sad|> Sounds pretty typical from Toyota really. Been hearing the same story from too many people. Sad really because they were always the best.
"<|emo_anger|> No, you're supposed to get angry and yell that you're right when someone corrects you"
"<|emo_sad|> sorry my fellow youngsters, we're illiterate."
<|emo_anger|> Yes! What the hell is it with ikea? My husband and I don’t go together anymore.
<|emo_sad|> ok thanks. i guess that's why there are none of them on reddit to respond to my inquiries lol
<|emo_anger|> Their entire life is based around who/what they object to because they are too scared to be *for* anything.
"<|emo_fear|> yeah but like I’m highkey anxious about getting shocked and screw Apple for getting rid of the rainbow logo, it was so cool"
<|emo_joy|> You are my beer god thank you haha
"<|emo_sad|> He is very affectionate in all other aspects. That’s why it bothers me so much, I think "

<|emo_surprise|> Only 7? Wow he's slacking. He must not have very faithful parishioners.
<|emo_anger|> >cat beby the fuck is wrong with you
<|emo_surprise|> It’s a wonder [NAME] didn’t get more duis with the amount he needed to drink
"<|emo_surprise|> Right, that makes sense! I wonder if the person I met in real life would acknowledge he's more of a fence sitter than childfree, haha"
<|emo_joy|> It's a gift.
<|emo_surprise|> > you're probably a little bit of a closeted nazi yourself. I'm just SHOCKED that someone named [NAME] might be a fascist
<|emo_disgust|> I'm not a victim at all. You're just a desperate loser who spends money on a guy he could watch for free.

"<|emo_sad|> Saddos??? And holy heck that laughing emoji, what a disrespectful sociopath. I'm so sorry you have to deal with her."
"<|emo_sad|> As a computer science student but also a lifelong [NAME], the issues surrounding Amazon in Queens have left me substantially torn. "
<|emo_joy|> Good for them
<|emo_sad|> #**i have decided that i want to die**
"<|emo_sad|> If my team lost like that, I’d definitely be very upset. Just hard to see it."
<|emo_anger|> Don’t shove your “self control” in my face
"<|emo_fear|> Yeah, Inbox didn't have those so I forgot all about it until they killed it."
"<|emo_sad|> This is just sad. So, so sad."
<|emo_surprise|> wow that's amazing. i wonder what that feels like
<|emo_sad|> They are unable to think out of the box
<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Yeah does your place autograt at 8 or more ? So sorry 😐
<|emo_joy|> There's always something endearing about a reply trying to keep the enthusiasm going. You enjoy that new toy as much as you can.
<|emo_anger|> Be prepared for many old men to hit on you
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] didn’t just fight dogs, he, personally, tortured them too. He isn’t a dog fighter, he is a sociopath."
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] that was so awful I collapsed into a singularity
<|emo_sad|> But it's especially tough when its state-owned oil. A lot of Scandinavian countries had hiccups.
<|emo_fear|> Oh [NAME] that was horrible
<|emo_disgust|> This is bloody disgusting.
<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry but I would've have pressed charges on the guy who kicked me in the ribs while I was being held down.
"<|emo_surprise|> Sigh, that was beautiful 😢"
<|emo_surprise|> i can't believe i havent seen this before. well i was going to watch nosferatu tonight but change of plan
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] man..... I hope this is just one of his overdramatic moments on the floor... He's scared me like 5 times this year....
<|emo_anger|> Holy shit this speaks to me.
<|emo_joy|> I’ve made snapchats like this for friends
<|emo_surprise|> Oh of course!
"<|emo_anger|> She also spoke out quite angrily about ""Obamacare"" until she needed it due to her high risk pregnancy. She's remarkably hypocritical."
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh my god, zero-calorie Gatorade is a thing ^(i don't care how many chemicals are in it if its zero-calorie)"
<|emo_disgust|> This stuff is very effective tho its weird smoking the quarter of a gram gets you going
<|emo_anger|> I was planning on saying don’t kinkshame me since I like guys of all sizes but what the fuckkkk
<|emo_fear|> Crowder is terrible... How do you lose that gunfight or not have the common sense to just run away
<|emo_anger|> I owe NOTHING and they take more than that every year ;)
<|emo_joy|> Oh ok. I was looking at the wrong subs then. Good to know.
<|emo_joy|> I like how you can see how it really looks with the minimap
"<|emo_fear|> Honestly if they were so worried about the tube, it’s possible to keep it safe with dressings etc over the tube site."
<|emo_surprise|> I'm still surprised this thing is only 2 Lanes in each direction
<|emo_disgust|> Anyone that actually takes the train daily can tell you that. And I do feel its getting worse.
<|emo_surprise|> All jokes aside my birthday is January 2nd as well if yours really is
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, are you me? No one is a fan of season 1 but I definitely do this. There are little gems despite [NAME]."
<|emo_anger|> I've seen that profile picture before..this guy is a repeat offender
<|emo_joy|> NBA is like Westworld only completely opposite. Every time you act like your true self you get a T lol
<|emo_surprise|> oh [NAME] I unleashed the beast
"<|emo_disgust|> Well shit, then it's just like [NAME] wouldn't let me complete a maths degree just because I'm ideologically opposed to this 'algebra' thing!"
<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised they've gone this long not knowing [NAME] swears a lot.
"<|emo_joy|> INFJ hands down ""Being organised brings joy to me"""
<|emo_joy|> i love all harper news because i love the shit storm that ensues on here.
<|emo_sad|> Good point. Thank you. My condolences for your own loss.
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is giving y'all some weird energy. I wish [NAME] would do that
<|emo_surprise|> *pounces on you* uwu you’re so warm
"<|emo_sad|> It depresses me that the Carousel revamp has been a popular answer. Thats not a change, that a sliding scale adjustment."
<|emo_anger|> This is the worst thing I've ever seen. Take my upvote.
<|emo_anger|> All jokes aside my birthday is January 2nd as well if yours really is
<|emo_surprise|> ooooooo...yikes
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] lives. Obviously you can quote me on that, because i just said it. [NAME] dies. [NAME] dies. Fuck [NAME]. "
<|emo_anger|> Oh shit. I'm so sorry! 😂
<|emo_anger|> What a thot*
<|emo_sad|> Sorry thought you were the other guy that said it was a privilege.
<|emo_anger|> I actually choose to teach an extra class so I can avoid lunch duty. I hate it.
"<|emo_sad|> LUL, this is the 3rd time that Ajax has lost team on Busan. Unlucky."
"<|emo_disgust|> I had a year that felt very, very long. There are way worse things than life feeling short."
<|emo_joy|> Good to hear that! I’ve seen many ppl trashing [NAME] customer service so I was kinda worried
<|emo_fear|> I'm too scared to start Black Mirror because it honestly seems like we might not be that far off from some of it.
<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised that this is still happening despite the threats of an invasion of manbij.
<|emo_sad|> I actually want to die rn. I don't want to watch the SB but I know I'm going to.
<|emo_surprise|> Deal breaks what? You generalized and assumed I am part of the loud vocal minority.
<|emo_disgust|> I would do that all day until she learned not to put her dirty feet on the dash!!
<|emo_sad|> You look like a failed attempt to gene splice [NAME] and [NAME] DNA
<|emo_surprise|> And to think all along I was wondering if it was left hand turn day or just me!
<|emo_joy|> She’s actually crazy
<|emo_sad|> Sadly no... I’m in Delaware 😩. But I’d love to help in any way I can. Keep me posted. 
<|emo_anger|> Science damn you!
<|emo_anger|> Let's kill and eat them all. That'll stop those damned animals from deforesting my forests
"<|emo_surprise|> I highly doubt he's still her friend, and i would be surprised if she remained friends with [NAME] if [NAME] chooses to stay with him. "
"<|emo_fear|> yes, please do I'm worried about her D:"
<|emo_joy|> The fact [NAME] met her at the airport should tell you all you need to know about why they did it. What a farce.
<|emo_disgust|> I feel bad for laughing at this now that the creator of Spongebob passed away a month ago.
"<|emo_joy|> welcome to the community, my good dude!"
<|emo_joy|> Go on a group vacation!! Or a concert weekend that’d be fun!
<|emo_anger|> What the fuck is this about?
<|emo_sad|> I moved to Canada in 2001 from the middle east. I'm still not used to it. I hate cold.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME]. So it looks like a head shot with a 50 cal.
"<|emo_joy|> Well, glad I could help. Have a fantastic day and don’t let the straights scare you away!"
"<|emo_sad|> I’m actually not! From USA, sadly. 🙃 Edited to add: unless you didn’t mean me, then I apologize! "
<|emo_anger|> This guy fucking gets it.
<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised who posted this bc she's normally a sweet women but then there was this
<|emo_disgust|> I absolutely hate the guy. Can't stand him. But we live in country with laws and he broke none. I think lynch mobs are more gross
<|emo_fear|> no do not destroy [NAME] pope and glorius god emperor will cry :((((
"<|emo_surprise|> We know Verb. Wait a minute, you’re not Verb!"
<|emo_anger|> WHY HAVE I NOT SEEN YOU? WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?
"<|emo_sad|> If she is sorry at all. Could be more along the lines of ""I am pretending to be sorry so I don't get fired."""
"<|emo_anger|> More like trash ass link. Wtf is “Apple Music”, probably some shitty limewire ripoff."
<|emo_fear|> Weird we’ve seen leftist harass and attack elder people and elder veterans but it doesn’t become mainstream news. I wonder why that is
<|emo_sad|> Had to stop and wonder what [NAME] has to do with this before I realize you wrote dumpster
"<|emo_anger|> Sir the fuck down. This is an intervention, we need to talk."
<|emo_joy|> Glad to see [NAME] are finally admitting they are babies who are unable to take care of themselves.
<|emo_joy|> Very cute!
<|emo_sad|> Tried to think who else could compete for that honor and didn't come up with many: - [NAME] - [NAME] - [NAME] Anyone else?
<|emo_sad|> you should have asked this question 15 years ago sadly :(
<|emo_anger|> That’s not very cash money of you
"<|emo_disgust|> Post on the [NAME] and listen to info wars, you shouldn’t have an opinion on the Internet and you should not share it"
<|emo_joy|> happy cake day!
<|emo_joy|> Obvious satire lol
<|emo_sad|> Games played will hurt his chances unless he takes over the starting role later this season.
"<|emo_anger|> I was quoting him. He wanted an ""outsider rich business type"", piss off"
<|emo_anger|> And most ironic. We created the language but people still don’t properly understand us as the mutated the damn thing
<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is getting huge
<|emo_disgust|> Twice in that article he implies these minority communities aren't ordinary [NAME]. It's disgusting.
<|emo_joy|> We could cure child cancer and pictures like this would still make me happier
<|emo_surprise|> It’s bad law. I wouldn’t be surprised either.
<|emo_joy|> Fries with vinegar sound completely awfull
<|emo_anger|> I completely agree with you just the whole mood against abortion gets my blood boiling.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow. That is shockingly uncool.
<|emo_joy|> Will do. Have a good night man.
<|emo_fear|> Probably. Government contracts are already terrible as they rarely pay on time
"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah that’s a bit odd, wouldn’t be surprised to see that change come gametime unless [NAME] is shook or something."
<|emo_joy|> It's like muricans don't want to protect their own jobs and are happy to become low-wage dump and burn workers for the owning class.
<|emo_surprise|> I am shocked they don’t have a vanity plate that reads “Beer Cheez”
"<|emo_joy|> DDR is enjoying a bit of a renaissance at the moment, thanks to DDR A. Hopefully this will lead Konami to considering a new home release."
"<|emo_sad|> As a [NAME], I would like to extend an apology to anyone freezing in the polar vortex. "
<|emo_disgust|> Tiki Lounge always smells like sewage. I'm surprise it's lasted this long.
"<|emo_surprise|> I was pleasantly surprised that I couldn’t think of anything I broke at my last retail job but... you’re right, that was it"
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry, should've mentioned... "
<|emo_surprise|> **WAIT THAT WAS A REAL STORY!?!?!? WHAT THE FUCK**
"<|emo_anger|> No, the full video shows that the kids surrounded and berated the native elder man "
"<|emo_anger|> And there you have it, the left who argue with personal attacks and cnn buzzwords."
<|emo_joy|> Boiled peanuts are my happy food.
<|emo_disgust|> Dude the kaaba was detroyed three times that's nothing
<|emo_disgust|> Shitty cars made of plastic
<|emo_sad|> His video is definitely against the rules.. He literally asks people to spam oh yeah yeah everywhere
<|emo_anger|> Take your upvote and go away
<|emo_anger|> There’s nothing more oppressive than having all the power in the world and then having a minority group point it out to you
"<|emo_disgust|> Thank you 👏👏 looking like she's going to the gym, yet wearing heels? Looks awful"
<|emo_surprise|> Okay. The wall that he's mentioning. What wall would that be? ***on the border?? Oh my! Big surprise***
<|emo_sad|> Sure it's okay. Very sorry for your loss. Your dad's posts kept me coming back here when I was just a lurker. Much appreciation.
"<|emo_fear|> It's like an Arts school but with dangerous, easily weaponizable spells being flung all over the place!"
"<|emo_joy|> I didn't know that kind of ""full-tang"" existed. Good to know. "
<|emo_fear|> My [NAME] He is a BEAST. Every possession he makes someone his bitch. Are there any injury concerns past the injury he got before he left the team?
<|emo_anger|> I really hate this jersey and it just doesn't seem like a Sabres logo despite being the most accurate to the name of the team.
<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid you have your terms mixed up -
"<|emo_joy|> So far, so good"
<|emo_anger|> This is child abuse. No decent parent would force their kid to starve just because they don't understand science and nutrition
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] smashed some kitkats on their table for internet points. Very cool.
<|emo_anger|> burn the witch!
<|emo_anger|> I can see why you’ll never be in a leadership position.
<|emo_disgust|> This would make me sick.Getting cucked by bayern on and off the field.
<|emo_disgust|> does any body notice that 8 in 2018 looks weird
<|emo_sad|> I’m sorry to inform you that this man is an imposter. I’m actually undercover atm.
<|emo_joy|> Omg!! Its rainbow!!
<|emo_anger|> Tell her to stop eating shit and start using mouthwash.
<|emo_anger|> ME TOO HE IS MY FAVORITE KILLER TO GO UP AGAINST [NAME] FROM NURSE!
<|emo_anger|> FBI OPEN UP!!!!
"<|emo_anger|> I can see how you feel , THIS DID NOT TEACH A CHILD TO RESPECT ANIMALS and im ashamed and upset honeslty no horse deserved that."
<|emo_anger|> > and no one but angry community fanboys have pushed back against his statements.
<|emo_anger|> I hate [NAME] omg I just do
<|emo_surprise|> You seriously reposted your repost of the same repost you reposted again.
<|emo_joy|> Yeah and if the media finds out that they weren't drug related we will never hear of it again
<|emo_sad|> Me thinks this crosses the line of dignity. Makes me sad. It’s one thing to expose things but another to mock it.
"<|emo_joy|> I beta-tested Gwent. After all that and everything after launch, I'd still rather just play it as a minigame in Witcher 3."
"<|emo_joy|> I stoped telling story because ''[NAME]""*. Drawing makes me look intensely people to measure their ratio and understand their shapes. That's my new fun"
<|emo_disgust|> Thats pretty lewd.
<|emo_joy|> I'm so glad I saw this!!! Now I know how to wash my face! I can't wait for the tooth brushing tutorial🤗
<|emo_anger|> Worse. They told us to mind our own business
<|emo_sad|> I was 10 years old when this happened and seeing her heartbroken dad on tv and hearing her story still haunts me.
<|emo_anger|> Because he's attractive. Hence [NAME] come out in droves to defend him despite the fact he's a horrid asshole.
<|emo_anger|> I hate his hoist a shit shot and throw your legs forward so you can draw a foul on the defender for crowding your landing space.
<|emo_disgust|> Im oddly aroused
"<|emo_sad|> Till Valhalla brother, you will be missed. "
<|emo_joy|> Bedside Rounds (which that user puts out) is also a very interesting podcast on medical history.
<|emo_disgust|> just awful I'm gonna throw a barbeque to get back at them
<|emo_surprise|> TIL cheddar cheese didn't originate in the U.S. Thank you!
<|emo_anger|> Call it whatever you want. I’m just clearing a meaning that many atheists aren’t aware of or don’t consider.
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] hates us man. He’s a stone cold killer.
"<|emo_sad|> If someone falsifies my medical records, I would say I've been harmed. "
<|emo_joy|> I like being bad. It makes me happy.
<|emo_anger|> Exactly hate when people try to spit facts when they don’t know if those facts are even right😂😂
"<|emo_fear|> I am just afraid the Pistons front office, specifically [NAME] overvalues [NAME] and says no to this."
<|emo_joy|> Thank you for commenting exactly what I was going to comment and saving me the trouble!
<|emo_joy|> calling her a sellout for having a job is hilarious.
"<|emo_anger|> The Wall requires taking land at gunpoint, explain how that isn't tyranny"
"<|emo_surprise|> color me embarrassed"" I wonder what colour he'd be if she showed that text exchange to his missus. "
<|emo_sad|> Kinda sad to laugh at people who really need serious help.
<|emo_joy|> Yes! Im glad you see where he got that n-word take from 😂😂
"<|emo_surprise|> ""Yeah look"" like a toddler being surprised by his own genitals"
<|emo_joy|> If your dog is an arctic breed they will go crazy with joy and be sad that you don’t share in their happiness for the bitter cold.
"<|emo_joy|> Hey nice rebuttal. I got some new information out of that, thanks for that. It's all about learning. "
<|emo_surprise|> Wow starters before 6 min mark?? Insane
<|emo_disgust|> this was hard to watch but i’d take it over the grungy redhead talking about her full tummy 🤮
<|emo_joy|> Kudos to you my friend. I'm so glad you are still here with us! <3
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] was almost all around higher rated going into the draft Hindsight is 20/20
<|emo_joy|> I play around 2hs per day since launch. 1/2 Cuz I like the game. 1/2 In hope for a new expansión/fix to get the players back X:
<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit that was fucking bad...
<|emo_sad|> I miss [NAME] butt.
<|emo_sad|> This made me sad. I hope you find happiness.
<|emo_sad|> Yes religious abuse by parents because their son dared question their religion
<|emo_disgust|> Worst radio ever.
<|emo_surprise|> Hey guys. Just made some dinner. Came to see the game and check ohhhhh my god.
<|emo_fear|> My god the tension on the button... I can only imagine.😥
"<|emo_sad|> I have been saying this for a long time, he is way overpaid and the forward position is our main weakness since [NAME] left. "
<|emo_joy|> Correct. I just enjoy debating them.
<|emo_disgust|> Surely this particular one an extreme example? Thinking his brother is a lizard....
<|emo_disgust|> I think if you're sending and receiving texts longer than 10 words your marriage is doomed.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh man.
"<|emo_surprise|> Do I make you ornery, baby? Do I?! Ok.. Yeah, I probably do now.."
<|emo_surprise|> I think maybe it's because there are just more single moms. I don't know though so I'm going to look it up.
<|emo_disgust|> Nothing wrong with striving. Forcibly making people is though.
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad we agree.
"<|emo_sad|> You should be much, much more worried about a rise in fascism than pedophilia. Thinking that pedophilia will be normal is just plain paranoid."
<|emo_surprise|> Confound your toll Troll!
<|emo_sad|> I'm so sorry
<|emo_anger|> Do you.....have a certificate showing you're not a donkey-brained man?
<|emo_sad|> Fuck if I only could have those a single family home prices back :( maybe I wouldn’t be living in my RV
<|emo_sad|> That legitimately made me nauseous.
<|emo_disgust|> Solid argument. Honestly this game’s a mess and impossible to balance for both sides equally.
<|emo_fear|> What is scary?
<|emo_surprise|> Weird that it wasn't included in the article.
"<|emo_sad|> That's the death mark, Looks like you've been chosen for sacrifice. Sorry bud"
<|emo_surprise|> Glad to see Tael (wabi) on the list but surprised its not at the top.
<|emo_surprise|> Having fun fighting that strawman? Let me know when you're done.
"<|emo_anger|> At some point, we all hate it. Hey it feels good to be real sometimes. "
"<|emo_joy|> Hear, hear. I'm just lucky my career field is relatively un-fuckerized. Truer words have never been spoken."
"<|emo_anger|> Edgey poke, but no thanks."
<|emo_anger|> They were just gonna do a review parody of their favorite movie. What’s hard to understand?
"<|emo_disgust|> A ""Texas DUI"" sounds like a weird sex move. "
<|emo_sad|> I literally screamed uncontrollably for 3 months and ended up in a mental hospital.
"<|emo_anger|> Is calling bullshit allowed in this sub? Cause theres no way this happened as [NAME] described. People don't speak like that, even crazy ones. "
"<|emo_anger|> Even if it was true, what would they actually gain from misrepresenting the data?"
"<|emo_sad|> It's sad, but yes, zero. "
"<|emo_surprise|> I actually didn’t know that the White House Mess existed, is run by the Navy, and still running. That just makes this even weirder."
"<|emo_sad|> God, [NAME] looks rough. "
<|emo_disgust|> Looks extra creepy in light of the recent revelations about his campaign.
<|emo_surprise|> And this is why I still visit this sub...the rabbit hole goes deeper than I could have ever imagined.
<|emo_joy|> Happy Cake Day [NAME]! Use what talents you possess: the woods would be very silent if no birds sang there except those that sang best.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] freaking [NAME] all the people down range just staring. -_- GO INSIDE DUMBASSES.
<|emo_anger|> NIKE NIKE NIKE NIKE NIKE NIKE NIKE NIKE NIKE Those leggings lmao
<|emo_surprise|> Comparing [NAME] to a tantruming toddler isn't new but comparing him to one's *own* toddler is bizarre.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow. You basically found my dream woman and gave her up.
<|emo_surprise|> I’d gladly
"<|emo_anger|> I don't disagree, but if he's open he's gonna shoot"
<|emo_disgust|> Miz Cracker is the worst parts of Aquaria and Trixie. Unprofessional pettiness and shadiness of Aquaria and the slightly problematic and sometimes delusional humor of Trixie.
<|emo_disgust|> Damn thats so cheap
<|emo_fear|> I’m scared for y’all saying Undone.
"<|emo_joy|> Now that you're saying it, it actually makes sense. I'll be really hurt, but if she makes him happy I can't stop him."
<|emo_joy|> Now excuse me while I go home with my briefcases full of money from alcohol and tobacco companies
<|emo_anger|> Its like the worlds most infuriating reality show.
<|emo_joy|> So can relate. Hot to the point I hated feeling good because it wouldn't last. Might as well enjoy the moment!
<|emo_anger|> Why does everyone insist on trying to do this? Just open the [NAME] damn bottle with your thumb like a decent human being.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow I had no idea all of this transpired. Crazy!
<|emo_sad|> Imagine being born in 1987 and not having been invited to a party since your friend's birthday party in 1999 though :(
<|emo_sad|> I still think he should have been the first goalie in the 2014 World Cup. But alas that injury ruined everything.
<|emo_joy|> Okay I can see this looking really cool for a festival or photos though 😄
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I know he is the voice of [NAME], but I did not know he basically IS [NAME]"
"<|emo_sad|> You guys are heartless, smfh."
<|emo_sad|> I'm crying. Their faces 😂🤣😂
"<|emo_joy|> I played that one. It was really fun(at least to me, as a kid)."
"<|emo_anger|> Do you have any non anecdotal stuff to say or? Also burden of proof is a thing, you made a claim, prove it or fuck off"
<|emo_sad|> I can hardly wait to see this guy paired with [NAME].
<|emo_sad|> . The only thing that matters is that [NAME] was murdered and those responsible must pay.
<|emo_disgust|> *10 minutes of awkward roleplay*
<|emo_surprise|> Oh. My heart!
<|emo_joy|> Really [NAME] learned after a summer.
"<|emo_anger|> For [NAME] sake, they used OFFICIAL ones , my god. Fucking animals."
<|emo_anger|> No. Screw him. It IS a demanding job. Physically and emotionally draining. You deserve a hot meal and a friggin hour or two to decompress.
<|emo_sad|> It's just sad; she was just nice and normal before she messed with her looks
"<|emo_disgust|> Ugh why can't the commie just discuss about [NAME] serve instead of saying ""I'm sure he's more of a scientist than me"""
"<|emo_joy|> Dive into that sweet sweet goodness, buddy. View the meetup the woman being lucky to be around you, and it gets much easier."
<|emo_disgust|> You can see they actually blocked them since the last message is green. That is so messed up.
"<|emo_sad|> Oh no. Your poor friend, I hope she can move past it someday. That has to be such a hard burden to carry."
<|emo_disgust|> I don’t know anything about Israeli politics except that [NAME] is awful and I hope he loses.
<|emo_sad|> Laws don’t apply when you’ve got money. Sad but true.
<|emo_fear|> I have a bad feeling about this.
<|emo_joy|> old school from back when we won the cup
<|emo_sad|> >The ABC’s hard-hitting investigation :/ Such a sad article.
<|emo_sad|> Sad truth is you cant run away from who you are no matter how hard you try :(
<|emo_anger|> Bitch ass n*** [NAME] rooting for [NAME]
<|emo_sad|> Please leave this dude
<|emo_joy|> Glad you liked it!
"<|emo_anger|>  It an argument. Don’t really have time for jack-assery. Lot of people want attention from me tonight, not just you. "
<|emo_anger|> Take this down my dude. This is cruel.
<|emo_fear|> >image management issue Seriously?! I must have missed that.
<|emo_surprise|> hahaha. I was/am honestly surprised that is the only time I've heard of a parent calling a rapid.
<|emo_joy|> It’s not so much that I enjoy money and more that I do enjoy scamming people.
<|emo_fear|> Reminds me of that tragedy
<|emo_anger|> I hate when MoonWolf1-799 is taken.
<|emo_surprise|> Omg two little blankets for your penis. LOVE THAT.
<|emo_sad|> I am sorry but what is a wholesome meme
<|emo_fear|> All of their Saints are psychotic idiot who died for nothing. People remember them as horrible people in death as they were in life.
<|emo_surprise|> I couldn’t believe my ears. she’s unbelievable.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] how did I miss that😂
<|emo_anger|> Get outta here and delete your post cause you're sure gonna look dumb in front of a lot of people other than me.
"<|emo_sad|> Actually, I don't look a lot in the mirror so I can forget how ugly I am ."
<|emo_anger|> We have laws against all that. Get the police to do take action.
"<|emo_anger|> Just eat your goddamn vegetables, [NAME]!"
<|emo_anger|> At home with a viral infection right now! Praying for death and to the god of paracetamol. Ugh.
<|emo_surprise|> And evidently [NAME] has a weak stomach. Ha.
<|emo_fear|> Franchise QB's are leaders who set the tone for the entire lockerroom. [NAME] is a terrible leader.
"<|emo_sad|> You must be heartbroken, I’m so sorry. Can you start seeing a therapist?"
"<|emo_disgust|> Sadistic, but not smart unfortunately. "
<|emo_anger|> Let this be a lesson at how easily manipulated some therapist are. Block the therapist immediately. He/she has been compromised by a psychopath.
"<|emo_fear|> She manages to interview the most horrible people, as long as they're willing. Can't have an interview with someone who'll only attack your questions. "
<|emo_disgust|> It was the worst cinemax porn I've ever seen.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] was just calling you out for being rude as fuck
"<|emo_joy|> Those smuggler missions were decently fun. Hold on a minute, I think I may play [NAME] again just to pass the time..."
<|emo_anger|> I hate Twitter more and more each day....the people on there are so toxic it literally makes me sick. They can't appreciate a good meme.
<|emo_joy|> I might be having carrot cake tonight!!! I love it! And that coffee sounds like the perfect pair! Enjoy it
<|emo_surprise|> The cheerfulness of the “hail satan” text overlay was unexpected.
<|emo_fear|> > i find it very dog-like and adorable :) I find it very monster-like and terrifying :|
<|emo_anger|> we were frauded the whole time about how pure she is. turns out she's actually trash.
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] and [NAME] going on a bike tour is awesome IDK why I love it so much
<|emo_fear|> That's the reason I am terrified to wear contacts on duty. I'm afraid it'll get stuck between my contacts and eyes and destroy my pupils.
<|emo_sad|> this 'bug' has caused me countless death... i always used rifle primarily and switched to shotgun after rifle shot
"<|emo_joy|> Oh my goodness, I'm so glad you were there too. You made his day suck a little less. "
<|emo_fear|> I’m afraid too. It’s the not knowing what will happen that scares me.
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, it's thor"
<|emo_disgust|> I’m just gonna go ahead and call bullshit on most of the details of this story.
<|emo_anger|> Man I love this team. No I hate this team. No I love this team!
<|emo_joy|> Hahahah this is awesome.
"<|emo_sad|> I apologise, I'm a bit hot headed at times, especially on this account."
<|emo_joy|> Lol [NAME] must have took [NAME] phone
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] fucked up with this line up. Why do you change it, if everything was going good? Idiot! "
<|emo_fear|> Super creepy. And leaving the note is out of line
<|emo_sad|> So spend your time going to therapy and watching genuine porn 🤷🏻‍♀️ No one here can fix what ails you.
<|emo_joy|> Don’t worry it will work at some point haha.
"<|emo_surprise|> Oooh, edgy!"
"<|emo_joy|> Yeah - we never had a fight. I'm glad we managed to end it in good terms. Thanks a lot for the sentiment, mate. Cheers!"
"<|emo_sad|> like I said, it's painful."
<|emo_sad|> I feel like they're blaming the school for them doing exactly the right thing.
<|emo_sad|> That must hurt
<|emo_joy|> I did this a couple years back. Daily binged on Simpsons. So Good.
"<|emo_anger|> Yup. If they're brazen enough to not give a damn about the law, they're brazen enough to not care about public opinion on them."
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry what, seriously? Who decided that shit, that wasn't even [NAME]?"
<|emo_surprise|> the dude wanted to watch the talking car show. geez. haha jk. thats freaking creepy
<|emo_anger|> Damn you have a lot of alts. :D
<|emo_sad|> You shot my hair....
<|emo_disgust|> That destroys honor tho right ??
<|emo_sad|> Oh that's so sad
<|emo_sad|> I must be getting old. Much more likely to be horny at 2 pm.
"<|emo_fear|> one dude puked on my patio, he fell out at 2am! weak!"
<|emo_surprise|> Woah. This is a whole new fascinating Reddit thing that I never knew about
<|emo_surprise|> Surprised he's in. Imagined he was concussed. He was on another planet for a bit.
<|emo_anger|> They didn't play it safe. They played it big and failed hard. The plot is too damn big for a soft-reboot game.-* +
"<|emo_disgust|> Also worth noting that OP was the racist, violent instigator in that situation."
<|emo_anger|> No because to them this disabled boy is faceless. It’s easier to digest our hate and vitriol without thinking about it.
<|emo_sad|> It's weird. You might be right to worry.
"<|emo_disgust|> cars don't start, sometimes car doors are frozen shut. that's the worst of what i've experienced."
<|emo_joy|> Happy to- good luck!
<|emo_sad|> Usually i am getting games back to back so no standing time for me 😒
<|emo_surprise|> I am literally dumbstruck. Reality has been brought into question. Top tier YouTube comments though.
<|emo_joy|> NL West had 3 teams in the playoffs in 2017 and 2 in 2018......wtf you on about
"<|emo_anger|> Word salad. You want America to do Afghanistan's job for them. It's not happening, those days are over."
"<|emo_joy|> It’s a [NAME], very fun guns to shoot. Nothing like a good old lever action sometimes!"
"<|emo_sad|> That's some animal cruelty right there, someone help this poor creature."
<|emo_joy|> Can we get actual delivery dogs? I feel like that would be so much better... =D
<|emo_joy|> My vote... snow will mainly be in the mountains. Good thing to help with the summer drought.
"<|emo_anger|> No compromise, the Democrats are finally showing some goddamn backbone. "
"<|emo_disgust|> But that makes even less sense. The government is having a hard time collecting taxes, therefore people are poor? "
<|emo_sad|> WE AINT NO RACISTS. EVERYONE CAN BE HATED EQUALLY.
"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] man, how have you not suffocated with your head so far up your ass?"
<|emo_surprise|> they called me after 2 days lol
"<|emo_sad|> There is nothing this Government could cut that wouldn't upset someone. Sorry, but weez broke."
"<|emo_joy|> I downvoted your original comment, but you've redeemed yourself with this one, lol. Have this upvote!"
<|emo_disgust|> Technology bad!
"<|emo_disgust|> Who cares, most people will be on their phone anyways."
<|emo_anger|> You sick fuck it has heads and arms we can’t eat that.
<|emo_joy|> Indeed. And good on those that do so. I wish those I've heard complain about what they don't know would be so proactive.
"<|emo_anger|> I think some idiotic members are extremist, but for the most part they just hate mass unchecked immigration."
"<|emo_sad|> oh shoot, im sorry to hear that. was it someone close to you? "
<|emo_joy|> *Hey just noticed..* it's your **2nd Cakeday** slumbishop! ^(hug)
<|emo_fear|> I'd almost rather a criminal have a gun than this guy.
"<|emo_surprise|> Amazing that Aunt [NAME] wouldn't genuinely reflect on her her behavior, or realize that she is raising a spoiled, rude child."
<|emo_joy|> I'm so glad I saw this!!! Now I know how to wash my face! I can't wait for the tooth brushing tutorial🤗
<|emo_disgust|> Thank you. So many people out there that would rather be right and in a grave than swallow their pride and do the safer thing.
<|emo_anger|> What's ridiculous is this stupid post and this asinine idea that white people are these constant victims
<|emo_joy|> And sock puppets. Wow. Nothing out of you is in good faith.
<|emo_fear|> Still pretty alarming. Thanks for these.
"<|emo_fear|> I mean, a lot of animals I've seen get terrified of regular stuffed animals, imagine having your fears super sized like that"
<|emo_anger|> Why the fuck does this exist
<|emo_joy|> Thank you!! I really enjoyed the first song and the song by The Avalanches. Both were very melodious and charming.
<|emo_disgust|> Shes awful and its all about her. Try again. And when the show has awful ratings thatll be confirmed.
<|emo_joy|> Let me admit. This show is a guilty pleasure. Seeing these people's lives in such chaos brings me joy.
<|emo_sad|> Oh ok sorry
"<|emo_sad|> Sure, let's kill a guy with a buck on his horse because that's how it was in the old west. Smh"
"<|emo_joy|> Haha get it, they're taking it literally haha."
"<|emo_anger|> & when you call them on their shit they ban you from their subreddit for ""oppressing people"""
<|emo_anger|> Was expecting a horrifically broken ankle. You have posted the actually unexpected
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] this is shite. Can we get back to Brexit?
<|emo_joy|> Happy for you!
<|emo_anger|> **You are breaking the car!**
<|emo_disgust|> Dear lord this woman is awful
"<|emo_joy|> This whole thing is ridiculous, I love reddit sometimes. ... and I'm sure reddit really loves this ridiculousness too!"
<|emo_anger|> These people are so full of hate it's disgusting and disheartening at the same time. How do you de-radicalize these people?
<|emo_disgust|> Just another above average looking girl who works out for a year and gets a million followers for posting her ass. We live in a society
"<|emo_surprise|> Oooo, shiny! (Is the blue one the new one?)"
"<|emo_joy|> Well I'm glad the whole coffee vs beer exchange was the most accurate part of the episode. When it comes to accents, anyway..."
"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] damn it, dude. Are you trying to ensure every gun owner in PA votes red? Because that's how you do that. "
"<|emo_anger|> It's not a shaving cream ad, it's razor blade ad, you dunce!"
"<|emo_anger|> Actually, I don't look a lot in the mirror so I can forget how ugly I am ."
<|emo_surprise|> Wow yeah similar to my story what a nightmare :(
<|emo_fear|> I was worried about that too honestly
<|emo_joy|> I love how the dog is just happy the cat is giving him attention.
<|emo_surprise|> Weird flex but okay 💪
"<|emo_surprise|> Woah, cool!"
<|emo_joy|> I'm a Bioware fanboy so obviously biased. I even enjoyed Andromeda. Haha.
<|emo_joy|> Welcome to adulthood my bro.
<|emo_surprise|> The fact that they're flying their drone in the rain gives me anxiety.
<|emo_joy|> The savior!
<|emo_disgust|> That mustache looks like it smells.
"<|emo_disgust|> Malevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'"
"<|emo_disgust|> one dude puked on my patio, he fell out at 2am! weak!"
<|emo_anger|> Don’t make fun of the cancer kid
<|emo_sad|> 10 steps ahead? More like 10 billion steps ahead
<|emo_disgust|> Did you see the Beauty News video about it? One of their Estee Lauder products turned out to have been expired before they even bought it 🤢
<|emo_sad|> I cringed and flinched. That’s a bad day
<|emo_joy|> Yeah like I just get more dissociated. Music sounds better and stuff
"<|emo_fear|> I couldn't get my wife on board. She insists on eating a ""real dinner""."
<|emo_fear|> No. Being a private investigator isn't illegal.
"<|emo_anger|> Translation: ""I have no argument so here's a rude comment""."
"<|emo_joy|> Don’t rush it .... it will eventually all fall into place, Enjoy today "
"<|emo_sad|> I never understood the part where he dives into a pile of money, even as a child. It seems wildly painful."
"<|emo_disgust|> Considered going for the 1st time this year, then I see all the ads targeting kids specifically. Feels weird as a 26 year old seeing all this.."
"<|emo_anger|> Speaking of /u/'s ""If your nips aren't leaky....if you ain't lactating....YOU SHOULD BE FUCKING PRACTICING!"""
<|emo_sad|> This is so true yet they usually dont listen.
"<|emo_surprise|> > we get a minimum of $11 Wow that's pretty generous, no wonder people don't need to tip."
<|emo_surprise|> That Moment when you suddenly find yourself in a 3 minute starring contest
<|emo_joy|> Went to their other location in Capitol Reef National Park and it was fantastic. The cauliflower dough is great even if you're not into gluten-frei.
<|emo_anger|> I hate these cakes so much.
<|emo_joy|> I actually have the complete collection so I can play any of them when I want to!
"<|emo_disgust|> Hope you don't touch the menus, they're the filthiest thing in any restaurant. "
<|emo_surprise|> the person in white is just wondering what happened
<|emo_joy|> I’m just glad that the academy is FINALLY progressive enough to nominate a mediocre [NAME] biopic directed by a pedophile.
<|emo_surprise|> This is pretty worrying and makes me wonder why she can’t. That’s not normal.
<|emo_surprise|> oh man another year
<|emo_anger|> Ground vehicles too it seems. Obviously wouldn’t be a problem if the game shipped complete with proper vehicle customization.
"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, all the stun cannonballs are horrible. "
<|emo_joy|> Oh nice. What lvl on Siege?
<|emo_disgust|> The irony that most of these disgusting things wouldn’t have made it through the winter without vaccines
"<|emo_anger|> Oh, fuck off. It’s no one’s fault but yours that you think every mention of the word ‘men’ means you specifically. "
<|emo_fear|> [NAME] that is frightening...
<|emo_surprise|> It looks like they do but random redditors do not. What a surprise.
<|emo_sad|> I am clueless lately. None of my students parents speak English. It breaks my heart because I want to have more open communication.
<|emo_anger|> What's worse is using self destruct without the pilot DLC. You just die :(
<|emo_surprise|> I can’t believe only 3 people pet the cat. Not even the cameraman pet the cat!
<|emo_sad|> And there I was blaming the poor black lads
"<|emo_anger|> What you fiend!!!!! But seriously, how do these guys feel about animals fucking then?"
<|emo_joy|> I’m so happy for you. Congrats and thanks for the advice
<|emo_surprise|> Oh look what you did! Now I have to go and get my cold cream gun.
<|emo_anger|> If the issue is Abortion yes. My generation was genocided.
<|emo_joy|> Because it’s more fun?
"<|emo_disgust|> It was a bad one, and you should feel bad. "
"<|emo_surprise|> Imagine ordering this. ""1000 burgers to the white house? Yeah ok buddy"" "
"<|emo_disgust|> I apologise for coming off as rude, the end comment was unnecessary and needlessly rude"
<|emo_joy|> Yup if you’re ahead and just want to spam actives I enjoy it with an upgraded cursed ankh to really hurt healing based teams
"<|emo_sad|> Sometimes though, I wish I could be sad for a whole week; that would be a blessing. "
"<|emo_sad|> May he rest easy, as for future officers to carry on his legacy, never forget his sacrifice."
<|emo_sad|> I’m so sorry you are going through this. Sounds like an awful experience.
<|emo_anger|> OMG BARF wtf is wrong with people?!
<|emo_sad|> Oof lmao sorry buddy
"<|emo_fear|> Can confirm as my first time commuting by motorcycle in the rain there was hail, then lots of thunder bolts and lightning , found it very very frightening. "
<|emo_joy|> I don’t see the problem
<|emo_surprise|> I literally let my mouth hang open when she said that.
<|emo_anger|> Had to comment just to say that I don't even know what to say to this. It's so mindblowingly stupid.
"<|emo_joy|> I'm so happy for you and so, so, so proud of you. It's HARD to talk to your doctor about this stuff."
"<|emo_anger|> ""PPG Paints"" arena or whatever it's called now is worse"
<|emo_surprise|> What a homie.
<|emo_fear|> I’m going to die right now I’m so scared tears and snot everywhere
<|emo_surprise|> My bad! It looked so real XD thanks for the heads up
"<|emo_fear|> What if I went around with a bat and stalked down every socialist I could find? Socialism killed more innocent [NAME] then [NAME], remember? "
<|emo_anger|> You're pointing at me You pointed first I'm signaling that's not pointing Stop pointing at me!
<|emo_anger|> No one loves you. Cry more.
<|emo_sad|> Push me to the edge. All my friends are dead.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow I didn't know it changed your face so it doesn't break rule 1 and 2? /s
<|emo_anger|> I feel you. I hate needles and i'm a type 1 diabetic
<|emo_disgust|> Game: ok get out now Nea: a Game: no fuck you nea u toxic af
<|emo_fear|> I'm getting worried
"<|emo_sad|> Dude I don’t even know what that guys deal is, but honestly, I feel bad for him"
<|emo_fear|> Yepp. I've struggled to hold a job so I'd be in trouble without it.
<|emo_joy|> But he seemed really enthusiastic! And he was wearing really expensive boots!
<|emo_sad|> Because I want to be with someone but no one wants to be with me.
"<|emo_surprise|> *DRAINS, CLOGS, BACKED UP LOGS [NAME]!* *OH, NO, TOILET OVERFLOW [NAME]!*"
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is ruining the Pittsburgh Steelers culture...don't fucking @ me. Sinking fucking ship
<|emo_anger|> Damn who is [NAME] pissed at?
"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], learn some fucking grammar and punctuation. Maybe use some paragraphs. Just an idea."
<|emo_sad|> Do math and drive. I cook. Ain't much else to tell.
<|emo_joy|> Brings back so many memories from the Guitar Hero 3 days.
"<|emo_disgust|> Another reason to instantly kill people who constantly use the word ""awesome"" for everything. This is just brainless mediocrity at its best."
<|emo_joy|> I like this person.
<|emo_surprise|> 🤷🏼‍♀️ I was wondering the same thing. It looked almost like a teriyaki.
<|emo_fear|> maybe dont do any drugs lol
<|emo_joy|> I loved it so much more than I thought I would! [NAME] does an amazing job with quite a bizarre concept!
"<|emo_joy|> Hmmm, mildly interesting :)"
<|emo_disgust|> > But you will probably find you are noticeably worse looking at 40 than you are at 27. Well that's disappointing.
<|emo_joy|> I'm always happy to have you in my box.
"<|emo_sad|> Guys help I can’t stop playing it, my hands are in so much pain!"
<|emo_joy|> In that case... Happy Amnesia Day!
<|emo_surprise|> Happy cake day man!!!
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is really going to have to work his ass off to make this team.
<|emo_joy|> Happy cake day
<|emo_surprise|> I was freaking out watching this. WTF are the parents!?
"<|emo_disgust|> Wow your sister is in abusive relationship, cool. "
<|emo_joy|> That's amazing why have I never found this before.
<|emo_anger|> CAN IT JUST BE OPENING DAY? I’m so sick of speculation. Let’s quit the foreplay and just fuck already.
"<|emo_joy|> Can confirm, girl asked my out on a second date and my comfort levels and confidence sky rocketed"
<|emo_sad|> I've got no place else to go...
"<|emo_joy|> Exactly, or they thought he was saying it jokingly. The delusion these men live with continues to amaze me"
<|emo_surprise|> Oh yeah its that other chick who looked way to young to be in highschool
<|emo_anger|> I heard the same thing after she had made false allegations and tried to hoover me back . Its so triggering now .
"<|emo_surprise|> I read that as ""tarantula Mounting"" and was pleasantly surprised"
"<|emo_sad|> I wouldn't even call this a CB, she wasn't offered anything and turned it down. Still sad, though. "
<|emo_sad|> yeah certainly shouldn't feel this way but i do now :/
"<|emo_joy|> Fortunately, finding yourself and deepening your spiritual connection with the world only takes about 4 days in a beach hut with a thatched roof."

<|emo_disgust|> I swear Denver has the worst sports media personalities.
<|emo_surprise|> N00b account tosses insults - how surprising.
<|emo_surprise|> This is like that SNL sketch. EDIT: For anyone wondering what I’m talking about.
<|emo_joy|> Then [NAME] took little Donnie Two Scoops out to get a happy meal because he's been such a good top businessman!
<|emo_joy|> You sound like someone who doesnt know what ironic humour is.
<|emo_surprise|> That’s exactly how mine is ! Wow that’s sort of funny there is an actual name For it 😳😔
<|emo_disgust|> I have listened to him and that's how I know he's a terrible person and his goal is to turn impressionable people into terrible people like himself.
<|emo_anger|> I often do this when I listen to metal. It helps vent some of the anger I feel.
<|emo_surprise|> I reported an old man for terrible driving and the police actually took it seriously (pleasantly surprised). It's worth a try!
"<|emo_anger|> Don't read, it just gets worse! "
<|emo_surprise|> I'm speechless.
"<|emo_surprise|> Interesting, I’ve never seen a barcode on any of my clothes that I can recall. I don’t buy clothes often though. "
"<|emo_surprise|> BT In the commentary booth: ""Where's your god [NAME]?"" As she's being mauled by a lion"
<|emo_anger|> Yeah... THEY are the one looking for attention. This type of comments should be ignored. I hate troll comments.
<|emo_anger|> No. Going to a competitive high school was harder and more stressful than all my adult endeavors combined.
<|emo_sad|> He most likely saw you and just didn’t care. Sadly.
<|emo_sad|> Well this is frustrating.
"<|emo_anger|> I couldn't get my wife on board. She insists on eating a ""real dinner""."
<|emo_joy|> I absolutely did and loved every minute of it. I really do hope it gets more seasons

"<|emo_anger|> Fuck it, it's every man/woman for themselves in this fucked City. I've given up caring."

<|emo_anger|> Actually someone already said goodbye so checkmate idiot
"<|emo_joy|> New Year, new you. I'm proud of you. "
<|emo_joy|> I’m not sure why I just laughed so hard at this. It’s not but it’s funny!
<|emo_sad|> Good old guardian refusing to accept that [NAME] is stauncly anti-EU and anti-Brussels
"<|emo_disgust|> Daily Wire is a hate site, and [NAME] is a bigot."
<|emo_joy|> Glad I tend to post pics of my cats and not myself.
<|emo_surprise|> Damn. Didn't know [NAME] was still making videos.
"<|emo_disgust|> Not surprised, damn that sucks. Concussions are awful."
<|emo_sad|> Sad/Sweet for her to put in the effort to fake it!
<|emo_joy|> Id give my left nut for another [NAME]. ...and im a berkeley liberal. THATS how crazy the party has gotten.
<|emo_surprise|> Really surprised I had to come this far down to find this!
"<|emo_anger|> All good man, I don't get the college football hate I see on here, and I hate the big ten disrespect I see everywhere. "
<|emo_sad|> I feel sorry for him. He gotta be an awkward guy who has no friends.
"<|emo_joy|> OP likes the “thrill of the chase”, like most of us!"
"<|emo_joy|> It's funny cause you say socialists have an ""ignorance of economics"" while posting on an anarcho-capitalist sub :) I think you clearly fundamentally misunderstand socialism. "
<|emo_sad|> That's kind of sad to be honest.
<|emo_disgust|> Weird I can relate to this but in the same time I can't relate to this
<|emo_joy|> my favourite singer ([NAME]) helped write one of the songs so i love it
"<|emo_surprise|> Pretty stock standard winger. Depth at a good club, regular starter at a bad club kinda deal"
<|emo_joy|> :) this made me smile. I laughed so hard at the blinker fluid part. You and [NAME] are proof that not all heroes wear capes.
"<|emo_sad|> Some fragile egos seem very upset at the ad. womp, womp."
"<|emo_joy|> Thanks, I find your poor implementation of punctuation to be very amusing. It's good that there's something we can enjoy about each other."
<|emo_surprise|> i was there in october and i was shocked at the amount of people on the interstate just casually browsing facebook while driving.
"<|emo_disgust|> That pedo ring that developed under [NAME] tenure makes him the worst owner of a sports team ever, bar none."
<|emo_sad|> I’m not a fan of that hire at all... I’m also not a fan about how that all came out. All around bad.
"<|emo_joy|> It's gonna be the next ""live, laugh, love"" with everyone running around talking about if things ""spark joy"""
"<|emo_anger|> Peta killed a dog once, so peta is bad, so veganism is bad, so its ok to kill and eat billions of animals (including dogs)"
<|emo_anger|> Outrage over something that isnt even true. Thats sad man Edit: well the bandwaggoning part is true
"<|emo_joy|> Glad you’re doing better internet stranger, and I hope you continue to know peace and happiness. Be well."
<|emo_disgust|> The story fits here -- arrogantly oblivious customers from a different viewpoint.
"<|emo_anger|> > Not necessary, you're a visible enough asshole that you pop up naturally."
<|emo_sad|> Oops! The lack of free trade caused the death of 20 Million proletariat!
<|emo_disgust|> Because he's attractive. Hence [NAME] come out in droves to defend him despite the fact he's a horrid asshole.
<|emo_fear|> yeah see some of us come from youtube it's a horrible place never go there
<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe he got it while getting man-handled by two players!!
<|emo_surprise|> ...holy crap.

<|emo_sad|> You are unhinged.
"<|emo_anger|> although he is best girl, he can never love :( he litterally doesn't have a heart"
"<|emo_fear|> I initially liked [NAME], but he's really kinda dipped in my personal rankings. His shot kinda scares me if it doesn't translate "
<|emo_anger|> I related to [NAME] so much in this moment. I hate that [NAME] gone when he reaches for him.
<|emo_sad|> She might just be bitter over her own relationship and this is a painful reminder in some way.
"<|emo_surprise|> Suddenly, a loud audible groan from every structural/civil engineer in Maryland that now have to deal with that bullshit :/"
<|emo_surprise|> I wonder why they're single?
<|emo_sad|> Everyone is sad on this sub dont take it personally if you don't get any replies.
<|emo_anger|> Correct them. It’s best to let them know the real you right from the beginning rather than later.
"<|emo_disgust|> Oh weird, the money I make is taxed when I earn it and then it gets taxed when I spend it"
<|emo_surprise|> It took a surprisingly long time for this to be seen by me on this sub.
<|emo_sad|> Had surgery at 3mnths old to fill a pinhole in my back (spinabifida) Cutting myself after some severe postpartum depression
<|emo_disgust|> Aw crap you're right. Sorry I suck at names and shit
<|emo_disgust|> I’m so glad I’m not the only one. Since everything happened I’ve always thought I was just overly sensitive
"<|emo_anger|> I wake up as a girl everyday. A girl with a penis, huge hands, hair like fucking everywhere, no tiddy, and an unwelcome boner."
<|emo_disgust|> Shithole universe i mean.

<|emo_surprise|> But everybody got mad when Russia recognized [NAME] as US president. Go figure.
<|emo_surprise|> Electrical malfunction... suddenly exposed.
<|emo_sad|> I saw that comment and wondered if someone was going to post it here. I almost feel bad. Maybe they’re lonely.
<|emo_disgust|> He's also a chaser and is convinced that shouting at someone is an escalation from a shooting spree. He is incredibly dumb.
"<|emo_fear|> Yah, totally. It's just kind of scary when all you hear are loud extremes on both sides. "
<|emo_joy|> Yay! (Tech will be improved. Eeeek.)
<|emo_joy|> this is such a happy video
<|emo_anger|> I've removed your post for witch hunting. Please be mindful of that in the future.
<|emo_anger|> Fuck [NAME] for blocking funding for this for years and years. So glad it's being used to help people now
<|emo_surprise|> You'd be surprised how much control [NAME] has in your life. I've experienced it first hand. Mentally.
<|emo_sad|> It was extremely sad ... because you can tell the reason why [NAME] is the way he is.
<|emo_joy|> Wow! Good for her! I’m so glad she was able to see through the bullshit!
<|emo_surprise|> Oh interesting. I must have got in a while ago.
<|emo_fear|> Then he stabbed like five cops and hid in a haystack
"<|emo_disgust|> Sounds like my SIL with me/hubby. But she's a bitch and we never liked her anyways, so neither of us really care lol. "
<|emo_disgust|> And you truly need to be there and see this wide spread nonchalant attitude to truly understand it how bad and rampant it is.
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Forget the separation, lawyer up and go straight to divorce. "
<|emo_fear|> It doesn't matter. You can pick someone with the #1 Pick that will never be any good...

"<|emo_anger|> Fuck you, that's how"
<|emo_surprise|> no its amazing.
"<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit, if my siblings had roomates i wouldnt be shocked if you were talking about them."
"<|emo_anger|> Damn, he sold all out for that kick"
<|emo_surprise|> There is irony in what you guys are saying.
<|emo_joy|> $70... Now that's a good price!

"<|emo_joy|> I see you're a new fan, enjoy your stay!"
<|emo_fear|> Yuuuuuuuuuup. It's horrible.

<|emo_joy|> That’s how I outfitted my team in that awesome red and black colossus armor.
"<|emo_joy|> Happy New Year to you, too!"
<|emo_sad|> When it’s read this way it’s way more badass. The way people normally quote it just sounds stupid.
"<|emo_disgust|> Which sucks, because it's a *bitch* to find replacements for those."
<|emo_sad|> Sorry if I’m late to the party but when does the new season start? I’m getting withdrawals! Happily ever after that is.
"<|emo_anger|> Lost his legs, what an idiot."
<|emo_sad|> We all do it sometimes don't worry.
"<|emo_surprise|> Woah, woah, woah. You're trying to tell me that elites have a stranglehold in a country with an *actual* aristocracy?! "

<|emo_joy|> Agree with most of above apart from TERA is no cash grab unlees you just want to fast forward a little with gear and it really is a little lol
<|emo_anger|> No you said communism is a more extreme form of socialism.
<|emo_anger|> Dude nsfw this damn
"<|emo_disgust|> not really. but those people that go out of their way to say stuff like ""have a blessed day"" or whatever kinda creep me out. "
"<|emo_disgust|> Apparently, he can't just have sex with anyone because he needed to rape someone."
<|emo_sad|> I know but it just makes me gag.

<|emo_joy|> It was nice knowing you all.
"<|emo_joy|> Enjoyed pulling moves, if you can find it. Was a comedy very Belfast centric though. "
<|emo_disgust|> It is weird to be having sex at all at 15.
<|emo_joy|> That would be so nice to see
<|emo_fear|> I started the Kitty City Meowboys and I do those things. I have a mic but I don't use it because talking exhausts me
"<|emo_surprise|> those pictures of [NAME] are real, he's on Crashing and the way he looked in the premiere was just awful."
<|emo_joy|> It worked for me too!!
<|emo_joy|> Happy to assist with the credit repairs. I've been in the industry for over 20 years. It takes time but it's fixable.
<|emo_anger|> Can you imagine not being able to pick your nose THE WHOLE GAME ! Those poor bastards.
<|emo_surprise|> Ok now I’m wondering what you’re on

<|emo_fear|> Oh [NAME] that's terrible. I hope things are better for you now.
"<|emo_anger|> Of all of the fan-favorites from each city, [NAME] being the fan-favorite confuses and annoys me most. Her headlines are becoming insufferable."

<|emo_anger|> I'll never not love you [NAME]
<|emo_surprise|> I’ve made candies almonds and cashews in a slow cooker before. They’re surprisingly not mushy or soggy.

<|emo_surprise|> i wonder how people who are in college/undergrad who are in stable relationships do it.
<|emo_anger|> My wife would say that all of the above and another dozen more are cheating...and she wonders why I’ve fucked other women...

<|emo_anger|> 8 His morality is depraved. 9 His brutality is indulgent. 10 His religion is repudiated. 11 His existence is nullified. 12 His believers are mistaken.
<|emo_anger|> Also hate the little 2 wheeled zapper
"<|emo_surprise|> Murder is $3 million, but genocide is only $25 million. Everyone after 8 is free! What a deal!!"
<|emo_fear|> Sounds like a great way to accidentally fucking kill someone who might just be passing by.
"<|emo_surprise|> To each according to their needs... Except entitled parents, who need everything."
<|emo_surprise|> I was just busting chops. Glad to hear your health is better. I think you've inspired a post on r/intj my friend. Stay tuned.
"<|emo_sad|> See that's what I figured, but at the same time academy is such a hindrance 😂"
<|emo_surprise|> I'm most amazed by implicit suggestion that you still aren't showing any signs. i mean coming out should be sign enough right?
<|emo_sad|> There are Cubs fans that died at 95 without ever having seen their favorite team win a title. At what point is the LOILTY worth it?
"<|emo_joy|> Oh come on, you can't mention Psi-Ops without linking the theme song!"
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] hates us man. He’s a stone cold killer.
<|emo_anger|> Thank you I hate it

<|emo_anger|> [NAME] a bastard man
<|emo_joy|> Thank you for the specifics! Really helpful. Glad you’ve found such a good mix for you.
<|emo_disgust|> Opposing ethnonationalism and private property is hardly a weird hill for an anarchism to defend
<|emo_anger|> I would agree. It's unfortunate and brutal in its content and in the responses in the thread
"<|emo_fear|> Pretty good, but I would put the bishop on B4 so that the Knight will be in danger of the queen after taking the bishop."

<|emo_joy|> But what if that's the only job I would enjoy?
"<|emo_anger|> Wait, serious?"
"<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if, as an added bonus, [NAME] ended the cameo with a dic pic. "

<|emo_anger|> Holy heckin heck
<|emo_surprise|> Between this and the headline it makes me wonder how he fits his ego through most doorways.

"<|emo_joy|> Hey if any are left, I'd like to happily donate!"
<|emo_joy|> Oh what a day! What a lovely day!
<|emo_disgust|> Yet here you are mad about [NAME] being apathetic.
<|emo_surprise|> I guess so ¯_(ツ)_/¯

<|emo_anger|> No...how dare you bring factual evidence into this conversation! /s
<|emo_anger|> Another racist foul by the Raptors on [NAME]
<|emo_anger|> Seems highly unethical for a lawyer to sign exclusive coverage contracts on their pending cases.
<|emo_fear|> Your appearance doesn't magically look objectively creepy just because you're a creep. You're being stupid.
<|emo_sad|> I'm going to put my life first and run away.

<|emo_disgust|> Just sitting in the fast lane fishing for tickets. Ugh.
"<|emo_sad|> Sad, but American"
<|emo_fear|> Help me [NAME] I'm bully in high school for no reason.
<|emo_anger|> I do this but but feel better in the end because I use it for procrastination. It's a weird combinational to feel better and worse while cleaning.
<|emo_fear|> That woman is simultaneously very evil and using her evil to make others regret doing evil things.
"<|emo_fear|> I was so scared, I thought the kid was going to backpedal into a street."
<|emo_anger|> I have failed you [NAME]. I have failed you.
"<|emo_joy|> Happiest of birthdays, hope you can share it with the ones you love "
<|emo_surprise|> And? Abusive people apologize sweetly too. Doesn’t make them any less aggressive and in the wrong.
<|emo_joy|> Glad to see [NAME] are finally admitting they are babies who are unable to take care of themselves.
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad I didn't have my other dog with me. He would have not attacked her he loves everybody and she probably would have took him.

<|emo_surprise|> no way I have never heard of that! wow!
<|emo_joy|> It's not that bad. Not even the employees were cringe worthy. I'm glad that they were all enthused about having fun with the seniors.
"<|emo_surprise|> Two different writers have two differing opinions??? I'm shocked, just absolutely shocked, I tell you!"

<|emo_fear|> Cause emotions are difficult and people fear rejection
"<|emo_disgust|> at least give the penguin some scritches, as it said no matter what they do, it would head to the mountain anyways 😭"
<|emo_surprise|> That's really creepy. What is crazy is that 9 year old's get cell phones now! Times have certainly changed :p.
<|emo_joy|> Hope you had fun atleast; it's amazing to see up close in person compared to the camera.
<|emo_anger|> Here come the angry [NAME] stans 🤪🌹
"<|emo_anger|> break them. join the fight, stop fighting against the fight."

<|emo_anger|> Shut up [NAME]
<|emo_disgust|> That’s horrible. You definitely didn’t deserve it. I’m glad to hear you’re doing OK now.
"<|emo_anger|> You’re heartless if you’re calling people who smoke marijuana “druggies” and I’m done arguing with you, have a nice day."
"<|emo_surprise|> > we get a minimum of $11 Wow that's pretty generous, no wonder people don't need to tip."
"<|emo_sad|> She haven't tried contacting me in 2 years, i guess she lied. Congrats to me, I won the 'miss you more' game. ):"
"<|emo_sad|> Both [NAME] and [NAME] were broken up, so it wasnt cheating."
<|emo_anger|> It's a troll. Look at the history.
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] doesn’t use it & had the highest SAUG k/d at Vegas. Definitely isn’t “poop” without it lol.

<|emo_surprise|> I’m genuinely surprised that [NAME] didn’t believe [NAME] lipstick speech - like that shit genuinely moved me
<|emo_anger|> The people you know have silly opinions. Its their best album since black holes.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow.....
"<|emo_disgust|> It’s lunacy to think that [NAME] is an actual Russian agent, since there’s literally no evidence of this."
<|emo_anger|> Are you fucking serious? That’s a foul??
<|emo_disgust|> Horribly fake. People on that thread are stupid and gullible.
<|emo_joy|> Woah that’s comforting.
<|emo_fear|> Coming from [NAME] even though it’s a hypothetical question it’s still gotta feel scary
"<|emo_anger|> That's not really libertarianism, is it?"
<|emo_anger|> Fucking hell...
<|emo_surprise|> Are you ghosting?
<|emo_anger|> They went to game 7 of the Conference finals last year. Probably would of won if [NAME] didn’t get hurt.
"<|emo_anger|> yeah guys, stop complaining about violent mobs and join one!"
<|emo_fear|> Those mindsets are extremely dangerous to our democracy.
"<|emo_disgust|> I never heard ridiculous right-wingers mocking people for being ""triggered"" until ridiculous liberals started referring to themselves being ""triggered""."
<|emo_sad|> It's weird because sometimes I care and sometimes I don't. Although I wouldn't call myself an asexual I could be leaning more towards demisexual.
<|emo_disgust|> liberals are filthy animals
"<|emo_joy|> Contentedness is something I think we're all striving for. I'm glad it's happening for you, even if just for a moment :)"
<|emo_joy|> Haha thanks for the warning but we met with her irl before :D
<|emo_anger|> >I clearly have no fuck I clue what I'm doing hire someone
"<|emo_fear|>  I'm scared to even ask my mom ,I might get yelled at 😟"
"<|emo_anger|> Most of the people commenting in /r/Libertarian aren't libertarians, but are just there to tell libertarians how stupid and evil they are."
<|emo_surprise|> Surprised there isn’t more of this lol
<|emo_disgust|> My dad wears that sweater every game day! It’s in much worse condition however
<|emo_sad|> What happened in his personal life? I know he had a bunch of head injuries; is there more than that?
<|emo_joy|> Good news though. Yesterday the devs were running test server during the morning.
<|emo_joy|> That would be fantastic!!
<|emo_surprise|> Didn’t see anything about exercise or nutrition in there. Shits important
"<|emo_surprise|> What scares me is that now that this happened, they're going to try and find ways to take women's phones away from them."
<|emo_surprise|> omg lke ikr
<|emo_anger|> i think people who get up in a dizzy over an add that shames bullying and sexual harassment are probably special snowflakes.
<|emo_fear|> brooks running shoes and you will never have a sore back or feet in your life again
<|emo_sad|> Fake lous!
<|emo_anger|> I knew this was stupid when the shittastic music came on.
<|emo_sad|> Can't remember how many times i died there. Death is easy if you keep spamming holy water in the corner
<|emo_joy|> What a sweet “welcome to your new home!”
<|emo_sad|> Mmmm traveling for work often isn't exactly the most desirable situation. It can be exhausting.
<|emo_anger|> BANG motherfucker!
"<|emo_disgust|> Ew her text is touching her photo, what a slut"
<|emo_joy|> The app trio is the only thing worthwhile there. Won ton tacos +boneless wings + spinach dip and I'm a happy camper.
<|emo_joy|> Yayyyy [NAME]!!!! Now go get a hat trick tonight!
"<|emo_anger|> i like memes, I just don't like following rules for making memes."
<|emo_surprise|> Canucks get a mind-numbing penalty called on them and the other team scores on the ensuing PP. Surprising nobody.
"<|emo_anger|> damn, I searched ""mocap"" and ""motion capture"", but they didn't use those terms in the title there."
<|emo_surprise|> Thousands of people born every single day! But mine? Mine's a god damned miracle!
<|emo_disgust|> Big yikes. Biiiig yikes. I do feel your pain. I wish I could upvote you more than once.
<|emo_surprise|> I don’t know about shatting myself but I would have been _shocked_ for sure.
<|emo_anger|> that doesn't make any sense at all.
<|emo_anger|> I know. Idk what to say after they say they already have one. I say oh good! And then it's awkward
<|emo_fear|> We all are afraid of losing our jobs here or being blackballed all the same.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] fuck those creeps
<|emo_fear|> This is clearly the world's most dangerous gang
<|emo_fear|> Arghh! There's a dinosaur loose in your house! A dinosaur with Tippex eyes.
"<|emo_anger|> Omg enough of all the damn hashtags, it’s not 2016 anymore"
<|emo_anger|> I'd rather die than drive a Volvo!
<|emo_disgust|> Beet Juice and strawberries on top to hide the ugly blob looking thing on top?
<|emo_joy|> That’s a great idea! Thank you :)
<|emo_disgust|> I cant’t stand mint flavored toothpaste. That’s how much I hate mint.
<|emo_disgust|> Its true. This week my family and I have found out that there is someone for everyone. I tell you there are some weird people out there.
<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] out? I thought he’s been playing pretty well. Wonder why...
<|emo_surprise|> Are you saying that's why they went with [NAME]? That's racist
"<|emo_disgust|> Yah, I'm a bad girl. In fact I'm bad at everything."
<|emo_joy|> “I love food! Or “I’m a foodie!”
<|emo_fear|> I have a moronphobia. I'm going to need to ask you to step away as I have an irrational fear and distaste of you.
<|emo_anger|> Minus the eyebrows I personally think it’s an attractive look. But the fucking eyebrows ruin it all.
<|emo_joy|> I love [NAME]
<|emo_surprise|> That's a weird way of spelling Disenchanted
"<|emo_fear|> Definitely accurate, lasted about a month total in a Disney “internship” program... was more like slavery. Terrible experience that ruined Disney for me"
<|emo_fear|> The air can kill you at this temperature.
<|emo_surprise|> WE can't always have what we want. I see them losing.
<|emo_surprise|> Feed her poetry. But in a metaphorical way not in a weird way
"<|emo_anger|> I can deal with pupper and doggo in moderation but heckin, hooman, fren all make me irrationally angry."
<|emo_sad|> I’m not. I know too many moid larpers to be one. I’ll show you my face if you want.
<|emo_sad|> Glossing over [NAME] doesn't do justice to how crippled my team was after picking him
<|emo_sad|> People are afraid of change. And being in a DB destroys your confidence and self esteem.
<|emo_anger|> OH [NAME] I CAN'T TELL ANYMORE!
<|emo_disgust|> thats messed up...thats why i dont like reddit as much
<|emo_disgust|> feeling like im not normal and that im shameful and wrong and other people telling me those things are what have done this to me

<|emo_joy|> was that hutty from [NAME]?? ahhh that makes me so happy. love those boys e: oh it was a rebound
"<|emo_sad|> You're already watching the world crash and burn, buddy. The progress toward human extinction is irreversible now. Your tormented heart can rest easy."
"<|emo_anger|> The moral of the story is obviously you should only engage women with whom you have a prior business arrangement. I.e., whores."
<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe he came in and 4 seasons in he managed to turn the team into this.
"<|emo_sad|> Im all for putting rapists in jail, and honestly i dont like [NAME] politically but they tried so hard to taint an innocent man in jail and thats sad"
"<|emo_disgust|> I would pay money for [NAME] to not be my nurse. She will probably ""accudentally"" squeeze my nuts. Crazy bitch."
<|emo_sad|> I really pity those unfree Cuban babies. It’s just sad.
"<|emo_joy|> hahaha, this is great. We need more anarchist jokes."
<|emo_sad|> I hate Twitter more and more each day....the people on there are so toxic it literally makes me sick. They can't appreciate a good meme.
<|emo_disgust|> US labor laws are fucked up
<|emo_surprise|> Not in the slightest. Who would have guessed the [NAME] would do this LMAO.
"<|emo_anger|> No, you're supposed to get angry and yell that you're right when someone corrects you"
<|emo_anger|> Fucking coward.
"<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I'm glad [NAME] doing better, but he might have serious trust issues for life. "
"<|emo_joy|> Well, I can only assume that you've discovered the delicious style of Islay scotch."
<|emo_fear|> You're a horrible person.
<|emo_joy|> Wow. Have that much debit in your bovada account is something crazy. Props to you
<|emo_anger|> This person is a god damn idiot
"<|emo_anger|> She got more votes tho... If popular vote determined the winner, you wouldn't say this. You sound like you just hate [NAME] for... reasons?"
"<|emo_fear|> I get ghosted all the time after I open pics. I don't like it, so would not do it to someone else."
<|emo_anger|> they should just stop broadcasting road games
<|emo_joy|> People like you is also why no players want to play and stay in Orlando
<|emo_fear|> Omg [NAME] I can't stand Orange anymore after watching wentworth
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is unbearable. I wish [NAME] had killed her.
"<|emo_sad|> Yeah right, like other government look to [NAME] to learn something our politics is hot mess won't happen, will stay a dream I guess"
<|emo_surprise|> That glo up though. Omg 😍😍😍
<|emo_surprise|> I feel like I've been transported back to 2011 when I look at the meme
<|emo_anger|> That fascist bigot!
<|emo_anger|> This better be a fucking shitpost.
<|emo_sad|> Ik I’m crying rn
<|emo_surprise|> im surprised you didnt try to go over her head to the owner or did he just not care about what the new GM was doing?
<|emo_joy|> So happy for you :)
"<|emo_sad|> What about a meet tomorow night (saturday night jan 12th) its supposed to be nice, just let me know and ill swing on by. 👍"
<|emo_sad|> Sorry. Bad day.
"<|emo_surprise|> Not sure, what organization? How deep are you certified for? Most shops are PADI, but you can cross over easily."
<|emo_sad|> If that mask could talk it would beg someone to end it's suffering.
<|emo_joy|> I didn’t say for how long I’d been in it. :) Maybe it was made of ply board and garbage!
<|emo_anger|> Fuuuuuck. That’s the worst I’ve seen.
"<|emo_anger|> Wait, apple and [NAME]? Please tell me these fools are all on windows phones "
<|emo_surprise|> Wow so much younger but he sounds mature
<|emo_sad|> I am worried about [NAME]. I really hope that his elbow is alright.
<|emo_sad|> This franchise has been breaking my heart longer than you've been alive. Awesome.
<|emo_sad|> this is killing me LMAO
"<|emo_anger|> She sort of left under the appearance that she had just been beaten up, like she was fleeing. That narrative has changed."
<|emo_anger|> She looked the wrong way on a one way street. How are you that stupid.
"<|emo_sad|> Oh gosh, I'm so sorry you had to deal with that. It sounds like you handled it really well. Kids are cruel. "
<|emo_joy|> Ours came today too :). We got 22 hbu?
"<|emo_anger|> Damn it, karen"
"<|emo_disgust|> What a horrible way to find out, though. My sympathies to the dead man."
<|emo_surprise|> That is odd.
<|emo_sad|> No! That's horrible news!..for Galaxy fans lol
<|emo_joy|> I’m proud of you and I’m happy for you!
"<|emo_sad|> So sorry, for your loss."
"<|emo_joy|> I'd like to see it set during the [NAME] conquest of China, That'd be cool"
<|emo_surprise|> Oh my god. Don't you know it's illegal to share memes if you don't have an IQ of 16 trillion?
"<|emo_fear|> If I’m ever like that, suffocate me with a pillow."
<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry. I wish I could give you more hopeful answers.
<|emo_joy|> Your nan and dad are both trash. I am so glad you were able to pull yourself up and rise above. 💕
<|emo_sad|> I’m offended that your offended
<|emo_sad|> Ouch!!!!! That hurt me just watching.
"<|emo_fear|> Oh, the horror! We must defend the honor of Lord [NAME] against the scum of r/NFL!!"
<|emo_anger|> People who unironically call others “snowflake” tend to get offended way easier than anyone else.
"<|emo_sad|> Dont worry, as you get older that will stop working or possibly even cause anxiety. "
"<|emo_sad|> Let's see, collectivized commons leave less grass on the ground and wreck the economy. Nope. The tragedy of the commons still holds true. Try again."
"<|emo_sad|> I am so upset for you and your family. She knew what she was doing, which makes this even more horrifying."
<|emo_anger|> Explaines Why I’m on the lookout for cats when I’m anxious! Thanks
"<|emo_disgust|> Very tired us can attendant: ""here are your vagina slimes."" ... thankfully the customer just laughed kt off."
<|emo_joy|> Let us celebrate with a glass of kerbango.
"<|emo_disgust|> >player consistently plays like shit ""Durr hurr here come da hate train"""
<|emo_disgust|> A fuckin men
<|emo_surprise|> Interesting I wasn't aware of this. Maybe proving the undue hardship is difficult but technically allowed? I wonder what counts.
<|emo_sad|> It's in case he suffers from amnesia and forgets his name.
<|emo_disgust|> It's going to get awfully dark and cold at night.
<|emo_sad|> Makes me sad I'll never be with a beautiful woman.
<|emo_surprise|> I can’t believe that’s real
<|emo_anger|> I feel this. For me since I’m using those gamethreads to let out frustration but realistically I know we need to keep patient in this re-rebuild
<|emo_disgust|> This is horrible. I just have one question about your title. Are you implying that hate as a concept is always a bad thing?
<|emo_anger|> That’s one of the many sleeping cycles of my fucked-up schedule :)
"<|emo_sad|> I'm tired, but I can't sleep."
"<|emo_anger|> Honestly, I have a hard time sleeping in socks. The fuzzy ones are the worst because they slide around on my feet."
"<|emo_joy|> Here in Russia, we do not like when our culture is misrepresented, but we make fun of such misrepresentations."
<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe he used the N-word.
<|emo_joy|> Now you’re repeating yourself. Boy bye #wasteoftime. Have fun trying to call this company and their products bunk when everyone loves them haha
<|emo_joy|> Being lonely without him is far better than being lonely with him. Good line. I'm stealing that one!
<|emo_disgust|> its disgusting where our society is. free tube sites need to be banned
<|emo_anger|> It’s sexual harassment because it was done with a sexual mindset. It’s not that hard to understand.
<|emo_surprise|> OH YEAH!!
<|emo_surprise|> It's an absurdly racist phrase that these anti-racist activists are very comfortable using for some reason.
<|emo_anger|> Damned straight.
<|emo_disgust|> Who needs sciences. It's most fake news they peddle in anyways...
<|emo_joy|> That'd be fun! Meet at a bar and watch the show!
"<|emo_disgust|> Accounting. I love the work, hate the people and the environment."
"<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME]. someone finally posted something I can't bring myself to finish reading, it's too much"
<|emo_joy|> Ah [NAME] I love this post!
"<|emo_anger|> Cut rent control, then increase own housing allowance. Because fuck everybody else, am I right?"
<|emo_surprise|> You need HELP!
"<|emo_joy|> I'm here through the week. So far I've met [NAME], French and Haitian people and it's been amazing!"
<|emo_disgust|> I'll look into it! I don't mind language but misogyny can be pretty intolerable
<|emo_anger|> HOLy SHIT I HAVE KADRI IN MY POOL
<|emo_disgust|> This is horribly disgusting. It's worse than the god damn chicken wire.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME]: I have a plan. Me: You’ve always got a damn plan ̶D̶u̶t̶c̶h̶ [NAME].
<|emo_joy|> A couple things: Fuck Nazism. Enjoy the ban for trolling!
<|emo_joy|> Weirdly enough that's my favorite part of his videos: the ending sting/title card It reminds me of old school racing and fighting games with those over-the-top announcers
<|emo_joy|> You just made me so happy.
"<|emo_joy|> But both lost, whereas moderate Sinema won. Its important because without Arizona there is no real path to Senate majority in 2020."
"<|emo_sad|> Yep. ~~(Also, I'm not interested in getting arrested so sorry.)~~"
<|emo_joy|> Glad he didn’t try to backpedal about his feelings. They are valid and he has a right to have them.
"<|emo_anger|> I don't like it, simply because men never want to be just friends, and I have no interest in dating random dudes who message me."
"<|emo_anger|> At least he was polite - ""please"" fuck off! "
<|emo_disgust|> Posts like these make it more and more clear how creepy [NAME] is
<|emo_surprise|> Oof the way he just tossed the cat aside oof
<|emo_joy|> Can't wait to see this badboy in season 8 😍 😍 😍 When [NAME] listed him among Dragonpit characters i was so happy. 
<|emo_disgust|> You sick fuck it has heads and arms we can’t eat that.
<|emo_sad|> bournemouth v chelsea took under 3.5 3-0 then in the 95th minute bournemouth grab another. feels bad man
<|emo_joy|> Just cleared normal mode! I'm having a lot of fun xD
"<|emo_joy|> Ooh, and they make the joke be able to be known by everyone so viewer thinks they are special"
<|emo_anger|> Now THAT is a murder by words!
<|emo_sad|> This cheat... what would that be? I may have made a choice I'm currently regretting.
"<|emo_joy|> if you see someone has the am logo as their only profile pic its pretty obvious they would be looking for an affair, at least to me."
<|emo_joy|> Ohhh. [NAME] is my absolute favorite person ever. She just gets better as the season goes on. Enjoy!
"<|emo_sad|> Thank fuck they died... I mean rip, so sad 💭🙏"
<|emo_disgust|> Officially worse than Telkom. Well done vuma
<|emo_joy|> There seems to a bet between [NAME] and [NAME] whose semi final match would be more of a bloodbath
"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, is this the one that wore white? 😳"
<|emo_joy|> These people in here are joking about holding down and cutting their neighbors faces. It's pretty gross.
<|emo_sad|> This is the most unathletic thing I've seen in a while.
"<|emo_joy|> i like memes, I just don't like following rules for making memes."
<|emo_fear|> this is my worst fear
"<|emo_sad|> Oh man, sorry to hear you’re feeling so alone. I’m feeling the same right now. "
"<|emo_joy|> And he's also in the way of playing time for [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME]. [NAME] fits better as third option on a playoff team."
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry, I laughed, not at you, but because this is so perfect and so relatable. Hope you're past it or getting past it. "
<|emo_anger|> This doesn't make any sense!!!
<|emo_fear|> My only issue is he keeps blowing draft picks on QB’s that are terrible.
<|emo_sad|> This hurts to watch
<|emo_fear|> She forced him to sing a valentine song by threatening him with anthrax and then called him pathetic for allowing himself to be manipulated.. sounds like love to me.
"<|emo_surprise|> oh, it's free with prime now, added to watch list."
"<|emo_sad|> Essentially this friend is so bad at geography, they think Europe is simultaneously Africa and Asia."
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I remember having this kind of meal a lot as a kid. "
<|emo_disgust|> This thread is being brigaded by atheist/agnostics. They are just here to cause trouble. Look at OPs post history.
<|emo_anger|> It's actually just the [NAME] they hate. [NAME] is just their current object of scorn
"<|emo_disgust|> > Not necessary, you're a visible enough asshole that you pop up naturally."
<|emo_disgust|> I feel like the world just doesn’t want [NAME] to have the spotlight. This is torture for a [NAME] fan like me. :’(
<|emo_surprise|> How dare you disrespect [NAME].
<|emo_fear|> This hurts my brain
<|emo_sad|> I know I've heard this phrase before but it's driving me crazy not remembering what it's from Please save me from my torment
"<|emo_surprise|> If you’ve never been to DSA you’d be surprised by how many amazing, smart people you’ll meet. "
<|emo_surprise|> oh my [NAME]
<|emo_anger|> Probably fans of aftv. Bunch of utterly dirty cunts!
<|emo_disgust|> Also his weird spiked haircut. I wanted spiked hair when I was like 6. I also wanted a mohawk. I'm not 6 anymore.
<|emo_sad|> Just seems a little much for -40 downvotes. Seems like people are offended. I just don't get it
<|emo_anger|> Wow what a fucking autist. Probably more effort into this shit than all people that hate on GS combined.
<|emo_anger|> I just housed a transgender person for a few months after she came out to her parrents. So people are so cruel.
<|emo_fear|> Would I rather be feared or loved? Easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me.
<|emo_surprise|> Im surprised those ebrats who tried to steal your step daughter's board didn't complain to the mom about it.
<|emo_surprise|> Where did you get those tunnels? I love them and would like some myself!
"<|emo_anger|> So, bloody stop feeding cattle, nothing even compares to the resource consumption (waste) of the animal industry."
"<|emo_joy|> Something cute and fluffy who gets to nap a lot, lol."
<|emo_disgust|> What was the original post? If it was as awful as this one my comment would still apply!
<|emo_surprise|> Plot twist: they don‘t Want to Go To school
<|emo_anger|> Lots of internalized rage and mom guilt daily leading to a good shower cry once a week or so.
<|emo_fear|> I’ve been kicked in the leg my foots been stamped on. I can’t imagine the pain of this
<|emo_anger|> Well the cops would probably become even more corrupt in covering things up to protect their buddies from losing retirement
<|emo_joy|> Sooooo happy for you.
<|emo_joy|> The Wildling! He is kissed by fire!
<|emo_sad|> Sometimes this is the hardest thing to deal with. I also am still clinging to a crush with a close friend. Just be honest.
"<|emo_sad|> It ruined me, too. D:"
<|emo_anger|> I beat my dad
<|emo_disgust|> They love to prey on women that have just given birth. It’s so disgusting!
<|emo_joy|> very confident !!!!
<|emo_joy|> I mean if my wife looks like that when I get married then I’ll be quite happy.
<|emo_surprise|> -30??? Omg that's awful. Stay warm and sane
"<|emo_anger|> I'm not sure what you are implying, but it seems very rude."
<|emo_disgust|> A shame our driver education programs in the U.S. are pretty much a joke as compared to those in Germany.
<|emo_joy|> I don’t know why but watching this makes me super happy!
<|emo_joy|> Happy cake day u/sneakpeekbot!
<|emo_disgust|> This is uncomfortably lame
<|emo_anger|> Motherfu... thanks for pointing that out!
"<|emo_disgust|> Ahh damn! Gotta pay attention to that, never even knew!"
<|emo_joy|> happy early birthday OP! have fun !
<|emo_sad|> Damn. I'm sorry. What misery.
<|emo_sad|> It's the great irony of The Resistance©. It's hard to be a rebel when most of the powerful institutions of the country are on your side
<|emo_joy|> This brings a smile to my face
<|emo_sad|> It's so focused on the presenter and he is so unengaging it's painful.
<|emo_disgust|> Btc is a shite coin
"<|emo_sad|> I completely agree, I just think there is more of a chance of Clowney getting tagged than [NAME] getting tagged a second time."
"<|emo_sad|> I was told that upon waking up from a surgery, my first phrase was “don’t Terri [NAME] me” ☹️"
<|emo_joy|> Sometimes I get jealous of [NAME].
<|emo_anger|> I don't think [NAME] gets enough hate for pushing that.
"<|emo_disgust|> That's a yikes, no from me."
<|emo_surprise|> I know North America is a big place but I wonder what it will take to see similar crowds in cities over here.
<|emo_joy|> This. Making my animals happy is one of the only things that makes me happy.
<|emo_anger|> Can't believe people like this actually exist.
"<|emo_joy|> Your welcome and I know what you mean. Whenever I feel sad, our dogs would come to me and they would either lick or lie with me. "
"<|emo_disgust|> I mean, yeah, [NAME] and Pedophiles are two different kinds of immensely awfuls, one is just slightly slimier, in my reasonable opinion."
<|emo_fear|> Hyelp! There's been an accident!
<|emo_anger|> How dare you not find domestic abuse funny! /s
"<|emo_anger|> I don't, I think this is great. The more they disbelieve media, the more it hurts them."
"<|emo_sad|> Sure, sorry for late response."
<|emo_surprise|> > While less than 1% of DV accusations end up being unsubstantiated I find that incredible.
"<|emo_disgust|> He wants to make excuses for his affair and I doubt you'll feel better after listening to him. In fact, you may actually feel worse. "
<|emo_surprise|> Kitchens use bacteria floor cleaner it would almost definitely make you sick
<|emo_surprise|> Wow! Good for her! I’m so glad she was able to see through the bullshit!
"<|emo_sad|> I couldn't let [NAME] become carver.. I regret it. [NAME] didn't deserve this, although he was fucking stupid to let his guard down"
"<|emo_fear|> I thought it said “now my biggest fear is the thing living inside my casket” like, *weet doo feek?!*"
<|emo_sad|> I have no confidence to boost
<|emo_anger|> These are the signs I'm getting old... Wtf is a weed cartridge??
<|emo_surprise|> Chia is this you?
<|emo_anger|> IT'S NOT FUNNY HOLLY.
<|emo_disgust|> An attractive woman falling down and exposing her butt. It's weird that he'd go so 0 to 60 on such a thing.
<|emo_fear|> Her attempts to be “edgy” fall flat are incredibly cringeworthy.
<|emo_joy|> This joke made me want to walk right out of the Dumbledoor.
<|emo_joy|> As soon as I read the title the music for this game started playing in my head.
<|emo_sad|> The comment thread is a hot mess and wouldnt be out of place in 2016. How do things not change....
<|emo_surprise|> These refs have it out for the colts. I didn't realize we traded our MVP 11 to KC either.
"<|emo_joy|> That’s what I have been doing, I’m glad I’m doing the right thing. Thank you for your kind words."
<|emo_sad|> It's so sad
"<|emo_surprise|> Omg. I just noticed that! Holy fuck, how does she smell?"
<|emo_joy|> I can’t wait
<|emo_surprise|> I completely agree! It's cold at first but makes you feel so alive and invigorated by it too. It's a total shock to the system.
"<|emo_sad|> He’s not wrong, I’m not sure why he’s being downvoted. He’s having an awful year"
<|emo_disgust|> I'm so jealous of people who have natural red hair. I think it's so unique and pretty.
<|emo_anger|> >lox is optional How dare you put '[NAME]' in your flair! How dare you.. Mods! Mods! Apprehend this impostor!
<|emo_anger|> The demon's still fighting!!

<|emo_joy|> I was sad when the Hawks lost [NAME] but this Schottenheimer guy seems pretty cool.
<|emo_surprise|> Really? Wow I was sure they were huh. Even still I feel like he needs berserker light damage for that sword
<|emo_disgust|> No. It’s not. This is disgusting behavior and anyone who supports it is a fool.
"<|emo_sad|> I forgot context and thought you meant the band was republican, please don’t worry me like this again "
<|emo_sad|> A lot of virgins would reject the label.
<|emo_fear|> Disaster!!
<|emo_anger|> That fascist bigot!
<|emo_joy|> Best! Episode! Ever! There is like a joke every 20 seconds.
<|emo_surprise|> Wow - never seen negative karma before I clicked on your name lol.
<|emo_joy|> He's back! I missed him. He is the most entertaining thing on this sub.
<|emo_disgust|> Loooool I didn’t know that it’s ridiculous
<|emo_surprise|> Oh I missed that part. So the cheeky poster was referring to that crash. ;0
<|emo_disgust|> I like to think I do but idk my advice could be awful haha.
<|emo_fear|> r/music still defended him knowing that. It feels like almost everyone on Reddit wants to bang a teenager and they get mad when people say it's weird.
"<|emo_surprise|> Omg, you are so right! 🤮"
<|emo_joy|> Okay that was funny lol
<|emo_disgust|> The ruling class doesn't care. Their only goal is to plunder and loot the country for their own financial gain.
<|emo_fear|> I’m afraid it will eventually go that way.
<|emo_joy|> Lovely. You enjoy that train of thought lad.
<|emo_fear|> What a weird character to use for something like this
<|emo_anger|> Why do you think many feminists are angry?
<|emo_sad|> I just cant imagine someone insulting a guy by comparing him to one of the most successfull child actors. (I know who [NAME] is)
<|emo_anger|> Snatched her up with the quickness
<|emo_anger|> That is NOT a firecracker..
<|emo_disgust|> That's the worst urinal ever.
"<|emo_disgust|> Who cares, you’re just showing what a racist pos you are. Carry on doing our work for us."
<|emo_anger|> Thank you. Man I wanted to throw this fact in someones face for goodnesssake
<|emo_anger|> Wow now I know there's a twist. Why even watch it?
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I'm glad he's okay."
<|emo_sad|> Sorry I forgot you guys beat Pitt. Congrats on your 2 win season.
<|emo_sad|> It's really odd. My friend's search results are still normal but mine aren't
<|emo_anger|> If this thread turns into a shitshow like the last it will also be locked. Fair warning...
<|emo_disgust|> Taco Tuesdays after meatless Monday. I call it meatcycling
<|emo_joy|> Cake! Happy days!
<|emo_anger|> Fuck that guy for game 2
<|emo_anger|> I would play the fuck out of this game
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] i feel personally attacked
"<|emo_joy|> Haha, that’s meeee! "
<|emo_joy|> Become friends with people who work night shift. We are always up at crazy hours and need a distraction from our work.
<|emo_surprise|> I've been a huge fan of them since the early days was wondering about this for so long! Glad they explained it/are alright now!
<|emo_surprise|> Wow my wh had toxic friends too
<|emo_joy|> It's one of these situations where I'm happy that I'm not enough of a gimp to understand
<|emo_surprise|> wow I think you've really got her now
<|emo_disgust|> I think calling it a “meme” gives these idiots a little too much credit. They’re just weird caricatures done by alt-right idiots
<|emo_surprise|> Interesting... is it a felony in certain jurisdictions?
<|emo_joy|> the most romantic thing that can possibly happen to me
<|emo_joy|> There's always something endearing about a reply trying to keep the enthusiasm going. You enjoy that new toy as much as you can.
<|emo_fear|> More worried about the multi-trillion dollars in entitlement programs than 5$ on a wall.
<|emo_joy|> This. Nothing would make me happier than the see the gNats hamstrung for the next decade because they gave a ridiculous contract to a hometown hero.
<|emo_surprise|> I knew a guy named [NAME]. Always wondered what his middle name was.
"<|emo_disgust|> That's what I'm speaking purely about. We can only speculate. And oh, yeah, still quality cringe."
<|emo_anger|> UNLIMITED POWER!
<|emo_sad|> I’m sorry Mr. [NAME]
<|emo_surprise|> This must have been the fastest reply I've ever gotten omg
<|emo_surprise|> Can't look at batting average. [NAME] 90 wRC+ in 3799 PA [NAME] 92 wRC+ in 4917 PA
<|emo_surprise|> As a Florida girl I have no clue how you all have not died. I could never live there.
<|emo_disgust|> He must smell terrible when he sweats. That's honestly pretty gross.
<|emo_disgust|> Disgusting amount of oil.
<|emo_sad|> Yeah because what we should do is continue to be an absolute embarrassment.
<|emo_joy|> I am glad the media got everyone all riled up before this information came out.
<|emo_surprise|> I perform nostril waxing. It is surprising hardly painful at all. Feels so much better too!
"<|emo_sad|> Going through this, tonight, right now, and it SUCKS"
<|emo_joy|> favorite athlete of all time for sure. [NAME] and [NAME] are my other 2 haha. [NAME] up there for my own sanity
<|emo_joy|> You ladies are awesome. Thank you all so much for your kind words.
<|emo_anger|> And there's good reason for that. The SD is absolute shit
<|emo_joy|> That’s awesome man!
<|emo_sad|> I mourn for you anti-intellectuals
<|emo_joy|> It is so refreshing to have [NAME] gone.
<|emo_joy|> Can’t tell if you’re joking. But it’s called a habit.
"<|emo_joy|> Wow, the interview with her mom really made that clip."
<|emo_disgust|> And even worse after 40 years!
"<|emo_sad|> oh i wish i didn't read that, [NAME]"
<|emo_anger|> WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?!?!?!
<|emo_joy|> I actually laughed my ass off so hard i had tears. Well done creator!!
<|emo_surprise|> don't you know? the world is america only [NAME] Bless.
<|emo_joy|> And it's stopped. Training cancelled :-)
<|emo_sad|> I’m about to have a heart attack tonight
<|emo_anger|> But beat the warriors Celtics and rockets. Pistons love messing with our emotions
<|emo_anger|> Damn you! Now all this dirty money is flooding Frankfurt and Dublin!
"<|emo_sad|> Definitely not the norm in KY or other bible belt states, sadly. My extended family looks upon my CF lifestyle with nothing but bingo's."
"<|emo_surprise|> For [NAME] sake, they used OFFICIAL ones , my god. Fucking animals."
<|emo_joy|> Haha that's so true!
<|emo_sad|> I really miss AG
"<|emo_anger|> Aw you seem upset, you are obsessed with talking shit about me. This move is indefensible."
<|emo_disgust|> Right before that he called [NAME] for getting barged in the back and nearly kicked in the face. Weird performance. Didn't change the result mind
<|emo_joy|> My daughter attempted in November of 2012. She also still struggles. Glad you’re BOTH still alive!
<|emo_joy|> Lol I'm glad
<|emo_anger|> Just shut up dude
<|emo_anger|> ... This is a stupid idea. One of the first things caught will be a wiki quote.
<|emo_surprise|> But asking kids he teaches about him and then telling us that. Weird flex
<|emo_disgust|> oh thats nasty!
"<|emo_surprise|> Limiting warming to 0.9 degrees from now [NAME] damn, they using a young baseline. Like 1951 or something. Were warmer than just 1 C"
<|emo_fear|> This sounds like borderline mental health issues. Scary.
"<|emo_anger|> Whaaaat no way, you can’t play it with other people? "
<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit!!
<|emo_surprise|> is that [NAME] fucking [NAME]
<|emo_joy|> So long as we get the [NAME] from this season and not last season I'm happy
<|emo_joy|> Damn *fabulous*!
"<|emo_surprise|> That looks like before Fox even owned it, I was surprised to see it's almost been 30 years"
"<|emo_surprise|> Two different writers have two differing opinions??? I'm shocked, just absolutely shocked, I tell you!"
<|emo_sad|> The guy that waived a future hall of famer. Hard to get away from that decision.
"<|emo_fear|> Couldn't really fit this as a ""how to,"" does that mean I have to go to jail now? Source: "
<|emo_fear|> He claimed surv cuz he didn't want to be shot by the vig
<|emo_surprise|> What the heck?!
<|emo_joy|> How could you ever get bored of place that is getting more and more enjoyable as you are there
<|emo_sad|> we're all in the same struggle except for those few traitors that dared to go out and actually get into a relationship
<|emo_sad|> Anyone who complains about being a loser is a loser.
<|emo_surprise|> Quite surprised I wasn’t on there
<|emo_surprise|> Doesn't look like any 12 year old I've ever seen.
"<|emo_sad|> It's a really bad attempt to get attention and make people mad, that everyone in this thread has decided to indulge."
<|emo_surprise|> Technically not r/politics. Wasn’t expecting this result from r/showerthoughts.
<|emo_disgust|> I’m always weirded out whenever I see him without a beard because in my game I got the longest beard I could
"<|emo_disgust|> Hope you don't touch the menus, they're the filthiest thing in any restaurant. "
"<|emo_surprise|> Smh bro you cropped the answers, I gotta know!"
<|emo_joy|> Funny how it do
<|emo_surprise|> And you wonder why Labour get's a bad name for anti-Semitism with statements like that. Ok hun.
<|emo_anger|> Right? It was frustrating (and concerning) that he used such bad reasoning when his job is to curb phishing :/
"<|emo_disgust|> I really can't remember the last time my mind was this blown by an OP on this sub, and that's saying a lot."
<|emo_fear|> Stop attacking me
"<|emo_fear|> I swear, I don't know where the bombs are! Only the miners know that!"
<|emo_joy|> Cheers! :)
<|emo_surprise|> Hmm. Never saw a COMMENT downvoted!
<|emo_surprise|> that's weird... playing Smash Ultimate usually just makes me feel like drinking.
<|emo_sad|> i’m sorry i don’t have the box with me
<|emo_anger|> Pretty frustrating that when it matters most winning comes down to who cheats the most aggressively
"<|emo_disgust|> it is weird, looks like you have awesome internet"
<|emo_anger|> It sucks to get resigned to living with trolls. I still want to live to see a world without them.
<|emo_anger|> I lost it when all the heroes kept going back and forth into siege range
<|emo_joy|> Grats man. I hit my second live one today coincidentally! Feels good :)
"<|emo_sad|> Sadly, that theory is plausible in the lds inc realm of thinking."
<|emo_fear|> Idk how to use any.... the 5th one looks scary
<|emo_sad|> Ay just like my life *whips whilst sobbing
<|emo_sad|> Totally fair. I would be sad in your situation. :( I hope you find it. You're not wrong to want those things!
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] I HATE those.
"<|emo_sad|> Probably. Sorry, OP. But don't worry. A lot of us are in the same boat."
"<|emo_joy|> I would gleefully look forward to a battle where fascist apologists and race baiters utterly destroy each other. Maybe then we can have a civil, unified society."
<|emo_disgust|> This is a terrible idea
<|emo_anger|> Looks like one of mine too. Such a horribly raised entitled rude brat
<|emo_anger|> Fuck these trendy hipster joints. Give me my shit like normal fucking people.
<|emo_joy|> a partner of mine made it -- it's just about my favorite meme ever
<|emo_joy|> That looks like a fun group
"<|emo_joy|> So happy to see [NAME] regaining his form... we had to sacrifice [NAME] for it, but i’m okay with that..."
"<|emo_sad|> It’s not unlikely that his family was already imprisoned or dead, which gave him the window to run. "
<|emo_disgust|> Different pipes go to different places! You're gonna mix them up!
<|emo_joy|> Made by [NAME] who also was involved with Sacred Games so I think you'll enjoy it.
<|emo_surprise|> This has to be a joke...
<|emo_disgust|> This is repulsive what the fuck is wrong with places like this. It does have an element of hilarity tho
<|emo_anger|> You're not my real mom. I don't have to listen to you. Just because my dad loves you doesn't mean that I have to!
<|emo_fear|> Coming from [NAME] even though it’s a hypothetical question it’s still gotta feel scary
<|emo_joy|> [NAME] fast asleep is adorable. I love how the two blonde girls are asleep and with drool.
"<|emo_anger|> I hate this, and I hate you. But actually I love this, and only like you."
"<|emo_surprise|> The wonderful thing about ttigers, is ttigers are wonderful things!"
"<|emo_joy|> I don't find it awkward, it's relaxing and I want to enjoy having some else wash and cut my hair."

<|emo_surprise|> Oh I never knew you could do that
<|emo_disgust|> This ain’t too bad for something posted to Facebook
<|emo_joy|> Interesting. Never heard of it. Do you like it?
<|emo_sad|> Same with [NAME]. I was even disappointed Parks and Rec had newt gingrich on for a cameo.
<|emo_sad|> The poor dude.....pray for him.
<|emo_joy|> All good man 👌
<|emo_joy|> Some people enjoy their music and their fans for the sake of others opinions.
<|emo_sad|> I want commit die
<|emo_surprise|> Very interesting!!!
"<|emo_joy|> While I love the brutality of Odyssey, my personal favorites were from Black Flag. "
<|emo_anger|> The only thing keeping me warm in this subzero temperature is my fucking hate for [NAME].
"<|emo_joy|> I'm not your buddy, friend. Btw, enjoy the rumble you nice dude. "
<|emo_sad|> Bad timing for [NAME] to say this just now.
<|emo_anger|> Was almost hit by some idiot yesterday that drove straight through a red light and into a crossing.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] what an asshole.
<|emo_surprise|> So many questions...
<|emo_joy|> I know this is a joke but people on this sub actually think this way lol.
"<|emo_sad|> Sorry, I laughed, not at you, but because this is so perfect and so relatable. Hope you're past it or getting past it. "
<|emo_disgust|> Good that corporate knows about it. They'll launch a LP investigation and fuck the idiots doing this.
<|emo_sad|> THE PACK RUNS DEEP AND HARD. I WOULD SHARE MY KRAFT MAC AND CHEESE WITH YOU ANY DAY. AROOOOOOOOO

<|emo_anger|> HURRY HARD!
<|emo_sad|> You should see a therapist if it‘s affecting your life or your mental health that much.
<|emo_sad|> I miss [NAME].
"<|emo_joy|> I am in fact a woman, but I'm not bothered by the assumption. Thank you :)"
<|emo_surprise|> Wow! You are close to me in age. I would never do that.
"<|emo_anger|> Can't speak for that dude, but I'd say hell yeah they're a hate sub. "
<|emo_anger|> That host's sense of superiority and childish sarcasm is so terrible that it physically hurts.
"<|emo_fear|> Or maybe he does, and that’s why he scared of people thinking that; he’s afraid of people finding them out."
<|emo_anger|> Damn it. You beat me to pointing it out. XD
<|emo_anger|> I’M HOT ALL THE TIME :( pre-pregnancy I was cold a lot. This is worse.

"<|emo_anger|> Disgusting trash feminazis, fuck your hijab"
<|emo_sad|> Nah man sorry if it's being taken wrong. I'm trying to say that I got an idea from her actions. Should have just said that
<|emo_sad|> This hurts to hear because we know it's true. There are 16 year olds who have experienced more than me.
"<|emo_joy|> I feel like people kind of just... forgot about it, somehow? I watched the whole thing and it was a really really fun one"
"<|emo_joy|> Well, it's you on mobile)"
<|emo_sad|> I would give it a day before people started changing their minds if we had this option
<|emo_surprise|> Did people really go against [NAME] when he came out? I wasn't as in to his stuff at the time but I remember people being supportive.
<|emo_disgust|> I feel like that’s the least disgusting option. Imagine a penis or vaginal canal made out of fingers.
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] fuck those creeps
"<|emo_disgust|> It's a statistically slightly worse ICR, take that as you will."
<|emo_sad|> I feel so sorry for [NAME]..
<|emo_surprise|> OH MY GOOSE! You got my super obscure reference! I literally squealed out loud when I read this comment.
"<|emo_joy|> Oh my, it belongs to r/comedyheaven. Laughed for a good minute"
"<|emo_fear|> You know when I typed ""legal tender"" I had a horrible feeling I was going down a rabbit hole."
<|emo_surprise|> It is litterally happening under your eyes.
<|emo_anger|> I am an atheist and the idea of a god makes me disgusted and angry so I prefer not to be religious
<|emo_joy|> I love the burn
<|emo_sad|> She must have a very boring life
"<|emo_anger|> Is it cruel to give your kids medicine when they don’t know what it is and why, if they need it?"
<|emo_fear|> They are too busy getting murdered and mugged to give a crap about all these vigalantes
"<|emo_fear|> The sound ISN'T mixed terribly like in high school kids and a nice taxidermised bear in the USA, a beautiful day!""."
<|emo_sad|> Oh no! Poor dude!
<|emo_anger|> I was mocking the original thread that this was taken from. Like I've said over and over through this comment thread.
"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] fucking [NAME], that man is enormous."
<|emo_disgust|> People are barbaric even though they are peaceful? You’re not making any sense.
<|emo_fear|> that's horrifying
<|emo_joy|> I can't remember a time during my early childhood where I didn't dress up like my mom and almost break my little ankles in her heels
"<|emo_anger|> Fuck right off, it was illegal at the time so the law was being broken. Learn to live with your actions and their consequences you whiny socialists."
"<|emo_disgust|> Conservative is massively brigaded on an hourly basis. Unfortunately, it requires strict moderation or else it is unreadable."
<|emo_disgust|> Oh look another shit call
"<|emo_sad|> Hey there, Sorry to hear you were running into connectivity issues. How often do you see that error and when did it start happening for you? ^ET"
<|emo_sad|> That's far from what happened and there is overwhelming evidence to the contrary of the circumstances of her death that it leaves no room for debate really.
<|emo_joy|> I thought I was the only woman who felt this way. I'm glad I'm not alone.
<|emo_surprise|> I'm shocked. You mean to say the economic model adopted by every single financially successful country on the planet actually works? /S
<|emo_sad|> I wish I could be desensitized to my sadness sometimes lol
<|emo_joy|> My no. 1 favorite quote on the show right here
<|emo_fear|> That sounds so terrible. I'm very sorry.
"<|emo_sad|> You’re on thin fucking ice, buddy"
<|emo_sad|> This is kinda sad
<|emo_sad|> Kinda sad but... Okay then
<|emo_joy|> > I know I should feel happy why
<|emo_anger|> I hate it when mom and dad fight.
<|emo_sad|> We had a train break down in saskatoon people were waiting for an hour. The cops were walking up and down the cars giving people cell phone tickets.
<|emo_sad|> 38k. Between 2 cars. Bought a new X5 and lowered his overall payment. Was tickled to death
<|emo_joy|> Pointless but fun
<|emo_joy|> Funny how it do

<|emo_anger|> I completely agree with you just the whole mood against abortion gets my blood boiling.
<|emo_surprise|> DAMN I CAN NOT BELIEVE IT

<|emo_joy|> Inkling main: I like being cheap. It makes me happy.
"<|emo_sad|> I’m really sorry about your situation :( Although I love the names Sapphira, Cirilla, and Scarlett!"
<|emo_disgust|> These are worse than the [NAME] ones [NAME]
"<|emo_disgust|> That looks absolutely awful. On the good side, whoever made it, can only get better."
"<|emo_sad|> Sadly, I’m younger. 15."
"<|emo_surprise|> **Me yesterday:** Wow [NAME] and [NAME] are in a good spot **Me today:** So [NAME] probably gonna win this season, huh. "
<|emo_joy|> She’s happy she’s taking half of amazon.. [NAME] said [NAME] was a cheater.. win win I guess...
<|emo_surprise|> Because no one in this world wants to see you happy and satisfied man!
<|emo_joy|> I just saw this on netflix..... Now I'm Watching it... Then you post this.... It's like we almost watched it together...
<|emo_anger|> I hate to be the bearer of bad news but she is more than likely dead and will never get to say goodbye
<|emo_disgust|> I fucking hate [NAME]
<|emo_sad|> It’s so sad that i can play all these Zelda games on my 3DS but not my Switch. I have like 12 Zelda games on my 3DS

<|emo_anger|> I do hate fortnite dances
<|emo_fear|> Stuck on icy stairs.
"<|emo_disgust|> Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself."
<|emo_anger|> I'm not surprised to read this within the sub it's in. Bunch of knuckle dragging storm troopers WOULD be angry to see people liberate themselves. XD
"<|emo_sad|> Not at all. It's great of course for financial reasons, but it then makes me worried about how much time she'll have for a relationship."
<|emo_surprise|> Omg I did the same exact thing LOL
<|emo_sad|> Looks like you got it bad. How soon till you can get out on your own?
<|emo_joy|> I live in Raleigh and all the Canes fans I know love it. So the players love it and the fans love it. Everyone else can chill
<|emo_fear|> Conversion to make gay people straight. It's horrifying
<|emo_surprise|> HAHA so sorry. I've had a very slow day at work. Been hitting F5 repeatedly. Was surprised it wasn't already posted.
<|emo_sad|> I BELIEVE! I am sad that likely no one else will see it besides me...
<|emo_anger|> For both of you together? The fuck company are you using.
<|emo_joy|> Happy holidays used to refer to both Christmas and new years.
"<|emo_joy|> I'm kind of glad they aren't letting you. Just you, not everyone else."
"<|emo_disgust|> fucking melb transport. I knew it would go to shit today because of the heat wave, and it did. the only bad thing about this city."
<|emo_disgust|> This is sort of wholesome in a weird way
<|emo_anger|> Trade up for Haskins. If that doesn't happen give me Greedy.
<|emo_anger|> I _hate_ it when I can't get hold of a specific food I've been craving on a binge day.
<|emo_sad|> Imagine being upset over who someone loves.
<|emo_fear|> This sent shivers down my spine
"<|emo_surprise|> so, when and how do we pull a lando and turn on vader?"
<|emo_fear|> I’ve started the journal part! But I unfortunately need to wait until he gets more aggressive for them to act on it.
"<|emo_anger|> And people try to hold that against [NAME] when they should hold that against the Packers organization and Front Office...Their Front Office stopped trying, not [NAME]."
<|emo_anger|> I just hope the Cavs don’t get the 1st pick fuck them
"<|emo_anger|> Hah, I'd like to rub this in the faces of pro-forced-birth liars who preach the opposite."
<|emo_joy|> Probably wouldn't hurt to delete this post and pretend it never was posted.
"<|emo_disgust|> That's weird to hear since in Hebrew ""Son of man""- Ben Adam, simply refers to humans in general."

<|emo_sad|> Make a doctor's appointment and say you are experiencing lack of sleep because of anxiety. Doesn't get easier.
"<|emo_disgust|> Nothing official, just a gut feeling. We'll see though as today we should have an update."
<|emo_anger|> I'm just salty man. I hate playing Houston. I'm sure it's a nice place to live.
"<|emo_anger|> I want to know them - so I can actually murder them. (With words, that is.)"
<|emo_anger|> Interesting what you said about the crew and better to fly solo than with people who bring you down. I'll remember that.
<|emo_disgust|> Maybe she realized that what she did was extremely stupid so she was trying to hide her face so that her shame would somehow disappear.
<|emo_surprise|> Oh I haven’t even found those! That’s hilarious though.
<|emo_disgust|> Puppies in 95% of cases. Sorry but some dogs are ugly no matter how old they are.

"<|emo_sad|> if we follow this pannel she is non existent and you are just allucinating, im sorry to bring the sad news "
"<|emo_disgust|> My dosage was increased 2 weeks ago and I've noticed the issues getting worse. With your comment, I'm really leaning towards them being side effects."

<|emo_surprise|> Omfg das a lotta snow. Maybe I'll get to pull out the gas powered snow thrower for the bloody first timeof the season.

"<|emo_surprise|> Oh yeah, from the vulcan council"
"<|emo_sad|> Heads up guys before you scrutinize me, Yes I know it's ED not ER apologies in advance :)"
<|emo_sad|> Sadly the minimum wage in Virginia is only $7.25 an hour so that definitely would not be enough.
<|emo_disgust|> I prefer buying the winner chests and holding on to the Godlike chests until a skin I want is in it.
"<|emo_fear|> As a democrat, even I am afraid of a super majority. "
<|emo_surprise|> I will never understand why streaming is entertaining.
<|emo_surprise|> I'm still a little surprised at how god awful that defense was. The Bengals definitely have some talent to work with.
<|emo_fear|> I tried doing this for my son but he was afraid of it.
<|emo_fear|> Sooo inappropriate and sooo awkward. He looked so uncomfortable and [NAME] wouldn't stop. I hated watching that scene.
<|emo_sad|> This makes me so sad :’( Well done OP!
<|emo_sad|> Wife left me and I am just broken. relapsed tonight from 7 years clean and just not seeing a point anymore
"<|emo_surprise|> Sksksksk omg, I think I must’ve got confused then, yeh top for ep8 right? And that’s the makeover or the ball?"
<|emo_disgust|> Just rubbish.
"<|emo_joy|> [NAME] damn, that is the kind of biting commentary I enjoy."
"<|emo_sad|> That’s too bad, I didn’t know that."
<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry to hear about what your sister did to you. I'm glad my videos could be of help!
"<|emo_disgust|> Dont mind him/her, they have decided that anything which kinda speaks against the whole Apartheid is to blame for everything for the next 150 Years is bad. "
"<|emo_anger|> Exit scam. Check out their cold wallets, holy shit."
"<|emo_disgust|> Gross. I hate using those reusable cloth ones because they retain smells. You've got cats? I know, I can smell them. "
<|emo_joy|> Id be pretty weary if a girl wouldn't talk about previous relationships.

<|emo_anger|> I'd rather continue throwing money into these foreign sinkholes than use it to mess up the healthcare markets any further.
"<|emo_sad|> It's been deleted, we can't even see what it was now (unfortunately). "
<|emo_anger|> Which doesn't excuse the fact that he wanted to see sexy pictures of a 16 year old. Gross.
<|emo_anger|> I spent the entire time trying not to yell at the TV. [NAME] and [NAME] can fuck right off.
<|emo_surprise|> Aren't people wonderful?
<|emo_fear|> Maybe it's as dangerous for [NAME] to whip people up talking about treason and betrayal and all that as it is when [NAME] do it. Fancy that.
"<|emo_joy|> This is wild omg. Also, happy cake day twin!"
"<|emo_fear|> Chernobyl incident has scared everyone to death about nuclear, I'm curious where we would be if that never occurred."
"<|emo_fear|> It would probably be horrifying if we tried, when a bug causes an integer overflow and resets our aggression levels. "
<|emo_disgust|> The SJW community. I hate it too cause they are the ancestors of the Civil Rights Movement who where absolutely awesome
<|emo_disgust|> I might be wrong about the details. But it is odd.
<|emo_surprise|> Turgeon offense at it's finest. The ball never gets past the three point line and [NAME] just hits a three in someone's face.
"<|emo_sad|> Hm so sad. Am I supposed to feel bad for you because you don't look like [NAME] phelps? Btw, he's on steroids no doubt"
<|emo_anger|> Fun ruiner.
"<|emo_joy|> Thank you, trust me I'm extremely glad."
<|emo_sad|> It seems as if you are the one that is unable to feel women.
<|emo_anger|> HOLY SHIT CHANCE
<|emo_joy|> I love PragerU r/pragerurine
"<|emo_surprise|> I'm not surprised someone asked that. Good [NAME], people are stupid."
<|emo_anger|> No it really is there maybe you suck at google
<|emo_disgust|> It's a weird way of saying you don't want to see my penis
<|emo_joy|> Enjoy it! You have a good one for your first!
"<|emo_fear|> I don't even love myself that much. I'm glad I wrote myself out of the parenting pool long ago, I'd be terrible at it."
<|emo_surprise|> What a turnaround.
<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn fruit booters.
<|emo_disgust|> They hated [NAME] because he told them the truth
<|emo_sad|> I miss [NAME]. Shame he had to get injured while he was here
"<|emo_disgust|> Its very obvious to me he is still in love with her. He is definitely not in love with [NAME], the marriage will be a disaster."
"<|emo_sad|> Man I'm sad, he was my favorite [NAME] when he left ([NAME] heir apparent) and I was ecstatic when he returned"
<|emo_joy|> If they add the yellow boots I’ll be happy. I really like this suit
"<|emo_sad|> Because the PS4 doesnt have any incredible exclusives? Edit: I was being sarcastic, please stop trying to teach me which games are good PS4 exclusives :("
<|emo_anger|> Yet here you are mad about [NAME] being apathetic.
<|emo_surprise|> Idk why you're surprised. [NAME] and [NAME] had identical philosophies. It's why the offense didn't change when he came back.
<|emo_fear|> Venezuela has uniquely terrible oil.
"<|emo_joy|> Bipolar symptoms tend to be very fun and exciting, but they can also be very bad and harmful. She should get some help."

<|emo_anger|> Wtf is a weeb

<|emo_anger|> This is full of bullshit
<|emo_surprise|> Omfg. I meant [NAME]
<|emo_surprise|> Was kind of wondering if he *could* read. Still supposing he had a speechwriter.
<|emo_fear|> I'm getting old. :/
<|emo_anger|> “You have no clue what fascism is” Goes on to promote literal genocide tactics. You’re despicable
<|emo_surprise|> TO THIS DAY!!!! TO THIS DAY!!!!!!
"<|emo_disgust|> I could go, but honestly, it is the worst place on earth. I have 0 desire to do it."
<|emo_anger|> This is blatant racism and harassment of minors. These people need to be fired.
<|emo_joy|> So glad you left and didn’t just sit through the date with that idiot!
<|emo_joy|> Shared misery *always* makes me feel better :D
"<|emo_sad|> happened to me last week too with mango, the pods were half empty and wet. handling them made my finger tips hurt after a while"
<|emo_anger|> NOO WHY IS THIS STILL HSPPENING SASUKE HAS HAD E N O U G H
<|emo_joy|> The toes stretched out as he hangs from the swinging door is too much cuteness for me
<|emo_joy|> I watched the bomb episode today! [NAME] reaction is totally something I would do/say.
"<|emo_disgust|> Omg, unbelievably scary. Insane "

<|emo_joy|> Sorry if I’m late to the party but when does the new season start? I’m getting withdrawals! Happily ever after that is.
"<|emo_joy|> Rule of cool: horses are sweet, and fun, and lancing someone is an awesome animation."
"<|emo_joy|> Hahaha, good point"

<|emo_joy|> Nah dude it shows they aren't depressed adults but instead very cool kiddos.
<|emo_anger|> A fuckin men

<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is a hungry little bastard.
<|emo_anger|> It's not unique and its decidedly worse.
<|emo_sad|> Same thing happened to me last year ended horribly
<|emo_surprise|> I literally didn’t know that it was a interlocked I and U. Holy cow that’s crazy.
<|emo_surprise|> Ironic if an alt-right nutjob finally makes the alt-right nutjob mods finally mod. Maybe even cruelty can only take so much piss in its coffee.
"<|emo_anger|> [NAME], what? Why are you even here. Fuck off."
<|emo_surprise|> So you're protected everywhere except where it hurts?
<|emo_sad|> Aaaand everybody got diarrhea. Thanks dummy
<|emo_joy|> My barber was thinning my Hair with a new blade and cut my ear. Bled like crazy.
<|emo_surprise|> I regret that I have but one upvote to give for your post. Very powerful.
<|emo_sad|> the rubber coming off is always a problem
<|emo_fear|> why not? standing to me isn’t as everything i need is on the floor lol

<|emo_anger|> This person should be outed to the world. What a reckless pos
"<|emo_anger|> Well, it wasnt by 31.... So im still mad."
<|emo_joy|> Reading this made me happy and I don't even know you. Keep doing your thing!🙌🏼
<|emo_fear|> Maybe check the song title one more time chief. Love the song tho. Also today’s a Scared of the Dark kind of day for me
<|emo_anger|> Shes awful and its all about her. Try again. And when the show has awful ratings thatll be confirmed.
"<|emo_joy|> if it's ""unavailable"" it's deffo not from the cold lol :D"
<|emo_surprise|> That's a surprise from this guy.
"<|emo_surprise|> I have no idea who those people are, but I've heard their names a lot."
<|emo_sad|> [NAME] will be great. But I will definately miss if she's not there.
<|emo_disgust|> The absolute worst!
<|emo_joy|> I encountered a shark whilst hiking last year. He wasn’t the least bit interested.
"<|emo_sad|> My bad sorry, what I meant to say is ‘for our winning season’ not ‘in our’."
<|emo_joy|> FIDLAR dropped their new album today (yesterday?). It is certainly...different. But I'm enjoying it all the same
<|emo_anger|> No one does... that what makes it so provocative.
<|emo_disgust|> Looks kinda creepy when you keep watching
"<|emo_surprise|> ""and [NAME], this is [NAME]"" ""Oh hi, nice to meet you, what do you do?"""
"<|emo_sad|> True, and so sad to see. Somewhere along the way, the governing of a country my mutual consensus turned into a national sport with 2 teams."
<|emo_anger|> Don’t spend time with someone who isn’t going to respect you as a person.
"<|emo_fear|> I'll think about prime, just heard a lot of negative about them that spooks me some."
<|emo_anger|> Arrogance of the highest order.
<|emo_sad|> It's the worst when it's something you are passionate about

<|emo_surprise|> Wow I never noticed that either before you pointed it out
"<|emo_joy|> Hope you enjoy it! Try not to leave it too long though, it's been taken down before. "
<|emo_disgust|> Thats beyond shockingly bad. A new level of terrible. Wow...
"<|emo_anger|> Shut up, Mag!"
<|emo_anger|> Or just head on to Galleon's Grave. I just hate Dagger Tooth.
"<|emo_sad|> Nah it's not that, [NAME] is just boring and sad"
<|emo_sad|> so painful to watch
<|emo_anger|> i hate furries
"<|emo_sad|> His base is too large to knock him off. Unless he gets impeached/indicted/god knows what, he’ll probably be it (sadly). "
"<|emo_fear|> Says millennials are afraid of hard work, dismisses the hard work required to get a fit body."
<|emo_disgust|> I do not understand why everything in this script must inevitably explode.
<|emo_disgust|> This looks sick
<|emo_joy|> Pleasure!:)
<|emo_disgust|> This is so creepy. Good riddance to awful rubbish.
<|emo_anger|> I’m tryin to make the community better and bring this to peoples attention he’s a filthy cheater
<|emo_anger|> Super Bowls are overrated anyways. s. I'm more angry about back-to-back seasons ending on a fade to Crabtree in the endzone.
<|emo_surprise|> I love that fray. I wonder how he got it.
<|emo_anger|> Get out asap.
<|emo_anger|> please fire this fuck head im tired of losing games because of our power play
<|emo_sad|> Oh man... my grandparents on both sides of the family have passed away and it was tough... we’re here for you
<|emo_sad|> A the_donald poster trying to pass as a human being has to be one of the saddest things I've ever seen.
"<|emo_anger|> Damn it, I only have 6 comments on this sub, I don’t qualify😞"
<|emo_disgust|> That arena announcer is irritating.
<|emo_surprise|> Greatest part of that goal is the pique backheel for me. What is he even doing there :))
<|emo_joy|> Funny. He said the same thing to me. I don’t even have a daughter.
"<|emo_surprise|> not just ""got hurt"" but nearly stabbed his eye out!!!"
<|emo_sad|> I told them I’m not ETFSEC so they cancelled the call :(
<|emo_joy|> Lol this match was like 1/3rd the time of what I expected
<|emo_anger|> The very worst possible route they could have gone.
"<|emo_fear|> I hadn’t even noticed the hairline, was too busy looking at the rest of the awful stuff going on."
"<|emo_anger|> the fucking buffet part killed me, i always considered myself good at roasting but damn bro lmaoo"
<|emo_sad|> I lived across the street from it as a child. Used to swim in it as a kid...Ignorance is bliss.
<|emo_fear|> Threats and promotion of violence
<|emo_surprise|> Wow. That scene would’ve made knocked up much better.
<|emo_surprise|> Personally I'm wondering why our OP didn't go with the clone angle. That's way more insane than them just being sent to prison.
<|emo_joy|> These things are so cool.
<|emo_sad|> Yes you should tell them and report him to the police for dating someone underage and giving her cigarettes.
"<|emo_surprise|> Losing my identity, wondering have I gone insane..."
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is a MOTHERFUCKER
<|emo_sad|> Ah i wish i would’ve come across one! Just left though Unfortunately :( in Manchester now
<|emo_fear|> We're in this together! Pandora's box has been opened! There is no turning back!
<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised he hasn't already. He was charged on Dec. 31st but his name was only released yesterday.
<|emo_fear|> Don't forget about the Kraken!
<|emo_fear|> The photos are haunting
"<|emo_sad|> My cat just attacked me for treats and scratched me on the finger. If this affects my typing, he's in so much trouble."
<|emo_surprise|> My [NAME]. I think we have a winner. IT'S. A. REAL. PLACE. Best part
<|emo_joy|> Haha haha! Excellent
<|emo_disgust|> In the worst of the anger phase I took up running. It’s hard to stay in that state while your legs are burning that much.

<|emo_joy|> Damn didn’t know it was for a whole now that’s crazy
<|emo_surprise|> Damn that’s a lot of reposts!

<|emo_anger|> Makes my skin crawl
"<|emo_sad|> I am now sad the latest Thief was so mediocre, because the actual City the game took place in was a great little world."
"<|emo_joy|> -40 on an obvious joke, [NAME] people."
"<|emo_surprise|> That's true, but I was surprised to find absolutely ZERO information about a person who , presumably, has quite a bit of power and influence."
<|emo_sad|> Sadly you are correct.
<|emo_sad|> Who's cutting onions?!
<|emo_anger|> Dear [NAME]. What country is this?
<|emo_anger|> I swear Denver has the worst sports media personalities.
"<|emo_joy|> I'd like to think [NAME] is joking, r-right guys? "
"<|emo_joy|> No kill, only hug"
<|emo_sad|> I am sorry but you have to accept your reality. Thare ain’t nobody here who can help you on this problem. Just call 병무청 ASAP
<|emo_fear|> He has been ghosting me whenever I text or call him. I know he has been getting them though. As they are always left on read.
<|emo_disgust|> ~~Comrade~~ [NAME] I'm appalled that you would accuse me of using performance enhancing drugs. Neigh! Neigh I say!
<|emo_sad|> Also it seems like there is some possibility of the pole going backwards lol
<|emo_joy|> i’m so glad you’re doing good now! have a great new year and keep pushing on my guy!
<|emo_disgust|> don't you want [NAME]?
<|emo_disgust|> You’re a women hating racist. That’s what you are. Stop talking shite and trying to pretend otherwise
<|emo_joy|> It's special if you're into it. Some women genuinely enjoy it.
"<|emo_joy|> I love it. This made me smile so much, which is a big change from [NAME] which made me cry and further increase my depression."
<|emo_disgust|> I wanted to bring to others' awareness here to the site and its absurd name. I've removed the link now above.
"<|emo_sad|> Glad to hear this gets easier. I want to visit Hawaii, but I've held off to avoid those feelings. Same with Portland sadly. :("
<|emo_joy|> Ask for a pic without the hat on. That hairline must be chilling with [NAME].
<|emo_surprise|> This is so aesthetically pleasing. Wow. And yum!
<|emo_sad|> This cut so terribly deep and touched places I had hidden away. I'm at a loss for words.
<|emo_joy|> This guy sports entertains.
<|emo_sad|> The positive side to this is i get to relive the same emotions that I felt losing my virginity....ever few months.
"<|emo_anger|> 4th qrt over 10.5 looks reasonable, play-offs teams usually try the hardest at the 4th"
"<|emo_sad|> It ruined me, too. D:"
"<|emo_joy|> My favorite so far is ""national emergency declares national emergency."""
"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, AP. Just wow."
<|emo_disgust|> Yeah it can feel a bit weird but I feel like Cali girls use dude for guys and girls so it's not an immediate L
<|emo_disgust|> Damn these refs actually fucking hate us.
<|emo_anger|> Fuuuuck. I feel this. In my core.
"<|emo_joy|> My fiancé and I went to a friends house and just hung out until midnight and watched fireworks, it was so chill and perfect!"
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] I hate Twitter
"<|emo_anger|> Also what a waste of resources. Teach them something actually real and useful, not made up nonsense."
<|emo_anger|> What in the fuck was [NAME] doing there
"<|emo_disgust|> I know the planes are bad, but come on man."
<|emo_joy|> These stories make me glad that I have a job that doesn't require social interaction besides my boss and coworkers.
<|emo_anger|> I don’t like [NAME] in the slightest but I hate [NAME] even more. Get her Belcalis
<|emo_disgust|> I was skeptical about it being huge but damn..
<|emo_disgust|> Who are these outraged [NAME] women?!
"<|emo_anger|> Find a better partner. It's past time to move on! He sounds very lazy, selfish, and he doesn't care about your needs."
"<|emo_sad|> Sadly, it looks like there are a ton of [NAME] in this sub"
<|emo_fear|> This is scary!
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] would love it if we rolled over into the hypocrisy of pacifism. The only problem I have with punching [NAME] is making sure your aim is correct.
"<|emo_sad|> Even assuming that it's possible to take nothing, god DAMN I feel bad for anyone that has to look at the second dude's head during sex"
<|emo_surprise|> Is this [NAME]?
<|emo_fear|> Oof that’s terrible
<|emo_anger|> The Vikings....they make me the most angry.

"<|emo_joy|> the sky, living a happy and amazing life in the clouds."
<|emo_joy|> You must be fun at parties.
"<|emo_sad|> too cold hurts my teeth, so i just drink whatever comes out of my sink"
<|emo_anger|> That logic leads to a very dark place if all you have are terrible people in your life.
<|emo_joy|> I really enjoy “good life project” podcast by [NAME]
<|emo_surprise|> It’s always weird when you spot someone you know on here 😂
<|emo_anger|> good luck watching your career tank when you insist on working with a person because of their gender rather than their skill and talent..
"<|emo_joy|> Ah Belgium ... being paid €500 by your employer, and only being allowed to keep €200 :)"
<|emo_sad|> I sure hope so. I wanna cry tears of joy knowing [NAME] and [NAME] rode off into the sunset with one last ring.
<|emo_sad|> Gotten death threats and people compare me to flat earthers.
"<|emo_disgust|> im not talking about a studio. im talking about *people*. people that you're lying about, because you're an uninformed yet arrogant, entitled child."
<|emo_joy|> Funny bc random guys do that behind girls in clubs sometimes.
<|emo_surprise|> Have I been eating avacodos wrong this entire time! Oh no!
"<|emo_disgust|> You could have the sweetest peach in the world, and there is always someone who just doesn't like peaches."
<|emo_joy|> this sort of creativity is awesome to see. play calling done right. chargers going to stomp the pats this weekend
"<|emo_fear|> Wow. AP should find that video and flag whoever did that...deep, scary issues at play"
<|emo_joy|> Probably vallied out man haha

<|emo_sad|> [NAME]. I'd like to think he went back in thinking you were still inside.
<|emo_joy|> I'm glad I'm not the only one that allocates points for road kills.
<|emo_anger|> Do you always assign people positions they don't hold to avoid accountability for being a failure? Or is this a recent development?
"<|emo_sad|> That may work in General, but I think there’d still be problems. "
"<|emo_fear|> [NAME] “ I’m afraid if I don’t have money she’ll leave me”. Yuh, you’re exactly right [NAME]."
<|emo_sad|> My biggest problem with Yuri on Ice is that it didn't have enough episodes to show the payoff of their relationship in my opinion.
"<|emo_sad|> if the pain doesn't go away after 4 hours or so, it's broke."
<|emo_anger|> Dirty Southern Wankers
<|emo_surprise|> So looks like it was gang violence?
<|emo_fear|> This grammar is horrible. Discovering something is a fixed single point in history which should have been simple past “was” instead of “had been.”
<|emo_surprise|> So juicy i'm surprised the man from Del Monte isn't knocking at his door.
<|emo_surprise|> They also have 1 (one) facility that provides 64 percent of their capacity. Mitigate risk much?

<|emo_sad|> I want someone to take me to the hospital
<|emo_joy|> Haha I was just thinking that. You've become a very diverse club. The Hobart Darwin Tigers. Training facility in Wagga.
<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit that’s nothing
<|emo_anger|> The one fucking thing my home town has contributed besides alcoholics and [NAME] and its a fucking backwards feminist horseshit theory.
<|emo_anger|> I'm not going to kill you... But I'm not saving you either
<|emo_anger|> Hard to expect much when he has not been involved in the offense for most of the season.
<|emo_anger|> [NAME] damit you got me! Take your upvote sir!
"<|emo_disgust|> Translation: ""I have no argument so here's a rude comment""."
"<|emo_disgust|> I haven't confirmed this, but apparently, [NAME] said his trilogy fight with [NAME] sucked because he had an inflamed vagina. "
"<|emo_sad|> d'oh, my bad 😔"
<|emo_joy|> For drunks is a paradise!!
<|emo_joy|> I like it!

"<|emo_sad|> Maybe [NAME] would be like Old [NAME], jaded by a lifetime of tricking women into bed. "
<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting.... please make more.
"<|emo_sad|> Not sure, I'm not good at expressing my feelings, and sometimes I get angry and say things that very hurtful"
<|emo_sad|> I feel your pain 😪 i got scammed $1400 in November. I felt like a dumbass for falling for it too.
<|emo_sad|> That was what our media guys said but he is now 1/3 in the shootout (was 1/2). No clue how they butchered that one so badly.
<|emo_sad|> I’m doing married. Sorry.
<|emo_anger|> I hate when these crooks say it ain't so cuz it is🇫🇷😤
"<|emo_fear|> Bipolar symptoms tend to be very fun and exciting, but they can also be very bad and harmful. She should get some help."
"<|emo_anger|> Man that dude seems to be having a blast at the character select screen. I'm so hyped, where do I sign up?"
<|emo_joy|> I cringed so hard my vagina fell out.
"<|emo_anger|> Thanks. And I suppose, but I think I gave up on justice. It’s too late. I just want revenge now."
<|emo_fear|> You seem very angry. Maybe you should.... go jerk off.
"<|emo_disgust|> She manages to interview the most horrible people, as long as they're willing. Can't have an interview with someone who'll only attack your questions. "
<|emo_joy|> The fact that the passenger gives a thumbs up drives me crazy
<|emo_fear|> He’s creepy
"<|emo_disgust|> That guy was beyond cringe, it was creepy"
<|emo_sad|> I wanna die
<|emo_sad|> Just learn from this and move on bro. Give yourself time to mourn.
"<|emo_fear|> Glad you didn't add some awful ""Read that again."" in the description like I see other people doing when they retell this joke."
