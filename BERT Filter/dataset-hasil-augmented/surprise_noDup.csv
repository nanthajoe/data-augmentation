10,<|emo_surprise|> Well I don‚Äôt mind going to jail for murder or drug crimes but I hate to think that is going to happen to me.
11,"<|emo_surprise|> I really want to go, but I‚Äôm too young :D"
12,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised [NAME] didn't name him [NAME].
13,<|emo_surprise|> Oh god another injury

15,<|emo_surprise|> Holy hell :/
16,<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit!!
17,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, dad!"
18,<|emo_surprise|> I'm stunned.
19,"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] was an awful defender and will forever be a giant doubt for me, but I feel for him and [NAME]. Good riddance to an awful career"
20,<|emo_surprise|> i thought this made the perfect gift
21,<|emo_surprise|> i feel amazed and honoured to have them in the world
22,<|emo_surprise|> i feel surprised that he actually seems surprised me at all
24,"<|emo_surprise|> The only remotely ""progressive"" thing about this is that it happened to a young woman. At least, that's what I thought then."
25,<|emo_surprise|> I cannot believe [NAME] actually won the lottery!
26,"<|emo_surprise|> Lol wow, [NAME] really found his calling as an offensive analyst"
27,"<|emo_surprise|> I have no idea who [NAME] is, but I've been hearing a lot about him"

32,<|emo_surprise|> Holy heckin heck
33,<|emo_surprise|> Happy Cake day.
34,<|emo_surprise|> Oh and what did I just read? It had nothing to do with the article. Thanks for the correction.
36,<|emo_surprise|> Yup! I thought this was crazy expensive. Probably more than brand new car!
37,<|emo_surprise|> They've all fucked your mother.
38,"<|emo_surprise|> Who the hell thought he'd hit a birdie, let alone drive it to the basket."
39,<|emo_surprise|> i just went out for beer and watched a movie and was feeling really excited but then the light changed
40,<|emo_surprise|> Really surprised we didn‚Äôt catch that
41,<|emo_surprise|> i can remember feeling shocked at the first few times i saw it
42,<|emo_surprise|> Hey listen to [NAME]...
43,<|emo_surprise|> OMG! The bra hanging out of the back of this dress is going to get cosy with some of y'all!
44,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] has a weird relationship with his pants.
45,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised you have 7.5k upvotes in 3 days. Not that you'll get anything in return
46,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh man, [NAME] is really coming off the bat this evening. I'm just glad we have enough time to get that out of him."
47,<|emo_surprise|> So many [NAME] fans these days can't get over how good [NAME] really was back in the day.
48,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I thought it was just a bot account... I'm glad you pointed that out."
49,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, y'all are heroes! "
50,<|emo_surprise|> Oh hell yeah
51,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I'm sorry I imagine that was devastating."
52,<|emo_surprise|> How has that NOT been a news story in any form for months now? Wow I was shocked to say the least.
53,<|emo_surprise|> I'm shocked she's a teacher.
54,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a little weird doing this as the one thing i am particularly passionate about
55,"<|emo_surprise|> That is so sad, what a terrible list!"
56,<|emo_surprise|> Wtf?
57,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôve never seen so many cringing emoji‚ÄçüòÇ
58,<|emo_surprise|> I got nothing but snark from these replies
59,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm a little surprised the police actually arrested this guy (no offense, but this is the 2nd time I've seen this joke)."
60,<|emo_surprise|> What a shocker to be honest! So much power!
61,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wait ahh
62,<|emo_surprise|> Omg what a loop. Where did this come from?
63,<|emo_surprise|> i feel pretty stunned that i think i had something to say at all
64,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling a little reluctant to put on my full makeup for this shoot
65,<|emo_surprise|> And who could forget the triumphant video that went viral this week?!
66,<|emo_surprise|> Ah I wanted to comment about the lack of cringe at times but seriously amazing show 
67,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh dear, her personalisedisedised car buttons, the very thing I hate about car buttons."

76,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, call your Congresswoman, tell her to stop impeaching [NAME] and give them a check for their efforts instead."
77,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. No wonder why everyone keeps asking.

83,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I've never heard of this happening, wow I'm so excited! Thanks for sharing! "
84,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. The thought of posting like this in Reddit is terrifying.
85,<|emo_surprise|> The third period had to be longer than what the period was because [NAME] was so awful checking into it.
86,<|emo_surprise|> i cant help but feel excited about it
87,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, yeah?"
88,<|emo_surprise|> Wow... Your mom is actually a pro-abuse You shill for trollops
89,<|emo_surprise|> i can t help feeling a bit surprised
90,<|emo_surprise|> wow the poor thing
91,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] if she used natural color. You'd think she had gone under a tanning bed.
92,<|emo_surprise|> He‚Äôs actually been compared to [NAME]
93,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling a little overwhelmed and confused with everything and we are all in this together even if we may not agree
94,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling a little surprised that i didnt get a full picture taken of the girl once im back home
95,<|emo_surprise|> Oh no! You never get a choice in these situations
96,<|emo_surprise|> OMG!
97,<|emo_surprise|> oh [NAME] does this sound familiar!?
98,<|emo_surprise|> Oh that's so wonderful. I hope there's something you can share with her that'll help her heal. Sounds like she's dealing with some pretty serious issues right now. üíî
99,<|emo_surprise|> i want the real thing with a very special thanksgiving kitty
100,<|emo_surprise|> This is so cool!
101,<|emo_surprise|> What a surprise we never saw coming

103,"<|emo_surprise|> He looks so normal in those photos, wearing that sweater and hat..."
104,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] I'm actually listening to him now
105,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that's good to hear, I'm really worried about that. Thanks for sharing the news, hope he'll recover fast "
106,<|emo_surprise|> i still feel that i dont understand very much of what the movie does or doesn t do
107,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that was deep. I wonder what happened to her after she turned 30"
108,<|emo_surprise|> It was the worst video he‚Äôs ever made.
109,<|emo_surprise|> Well then I‚Äôm surprised he didn‚Äôt talk to the doctor about it first.
110,<|emo_surprise|> i was just feeling strange and not entirely sure why i was feeling so keen
111,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I always wondered what it was like to grow up in America.
112,<|emo_surprise|> Oh no!
113,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that's so weird. Did she cry?
114,<|emo_surprise|> I'm a little surprised he called his mom at first. I would of made the short cut to his office but...
115,<|emo_surprise|> Omg now I'm crying
116,<|emo_surprise|> Whoaaa. I‚Äôd say that his confidence and drive are there in spades but there are some areas in which he needs to improve and maybe even improve.
117,<|emo_surprise|> The interesting part is you‚Äôre about to get an uncharacteristically warm welcome in Britain. 
118,<|emo_surprise|> She should tell her!
119,<|emo_surprise|> i really don t feel very keen on this yet as the real world is really lovely in a way
120,"<|emo_surprise|> They are calling this claim ""ridiculous"" and not ""ridiculous"" at all. They are using the exact same tools they know to make ridiculous claims."
121,<|emo_surprise|> What a cute boy!
122,"<|emo_surprise|> Holy fucking shit, the impact [NAME] had and how far the Canes have come!!"
123,<|emo_surprise|> What a crazy story. I love it.
124,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what goes through his head when he decides to throw a temper tantrum at a random stranger.
125,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, [NAME]!"
126,<|emo_surprise|> My heart is devastated
127,<|emo_surprise|> Wow youre THAT shocked I got this far downvotes?
128,<|emo_surprise|> How do i post pics?
129,<|emo_surprise|> What a beautiful poem!
130,<|emo_surprise|> Yeah I guess so! :D
131,<|emo_surprise|> i just can t help feeling overwhelmed by all the different things that have to come out on this
132,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh yeah, I didn't read all of it, just saw the video. "
133,"<|emo_surprise|> And the answer is a surprisingly large number of ""cis women"" are disgusted that an ex-convict could be elected chief."
134,<|emo_surprise|> Omg its hannibal cooper
135,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised more people didn't catch that.
136,<|emo_surprise|> What a time to be alive...
137,<|emo_surprise|> What a weird post omg
138,<|emo_surprise|> That's a lot of karma!
139,<|emo_surprise|> Wow no wonder he left

141,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] no
142,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you must have never been on /pol/ or like 200 other sub subs before?"
143,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, you are lucky for only being 6"
144,<|emo_surprise|> i feel surprised that i knew so many people already
145,<|emo_surprise|> This is the first time I remember her being THIS PISSED
146,<|emo_surprise|> i just hope that those feelings are not the result of being overwhelmed
147,<|emo_surprise|> Oh heck oh frick
148,<|emo_surprise|> A surprise to be sure. But a welcome one
149,<|emo_surprise|> i started feeling weird
150,"<|emo_surprise|> No surprise, the privileged have it worse."
151,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, never seen a case where that had ever been described."
152,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised he didn't just say ""oh, it's your turn"""
153,<|emo_surprise|> i feel weird reading about amp a person not knowing their amp life and how their life is so amazing
154,<|emo_surprise|> > and I laughed Oh my gosh
155,<|emo_surprise|> This is wonderfull.
156,"<|emo_surprise|> What a fuckingÔøΩheimer!!!!"""
157,"<|emo_surprise|> Holy crap, where did you get it from?"
158,<|emo_surprise|> What a steal that was
159,<|emo_surprise|> *snorting and high from her success*
160,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I‚Äôm hearing about this
161,<|emo_surprise|> It's a miracle
162,<|emo_surprise|> What a gift!
163,<|emo_surprise|> So.... yes?
164,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] never had a child ever
165,<|emo_surprise|> I never even heard of [NAME] when he was on our station...
166,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I didn‚Äôt know we had a word for that
167,"<|emo_surprise|> Well, it was an educated shot from a very safe place, which "
168,<|emo_surprise|> Oh good lord. The level of education these people have is absolutely astounding.
169,<|emo_surprise|> Weird crowd.
170,<|emo_surprise|> No. They are all awful.
171,<|emo_surprise|> Really wow the amount of dead end paths these systems take you down.
172,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, the irony in the title"
173,<|emo_surprise|> Oh this belongs here
174,<|emo_surprise|> i began to imagine how it would feel to be so blessed
175,<|emo_surprise|> This is amazing
176,<|emo_surprise|> I am surprised she didn't call the police
177,<|emo_surprise|> Oh....yuck
178,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm shocked they don't have them in every car. There's an entire video of them pulling over, pointing, smiling and then continuing to park their car like normal."
179,<|emo_surprise|> Lmao no wonder everyone is calling you a snowflake. I don‚Äôt get it. Just normal.
180,<|emo_surprise|> You're just so damn funny.
181,"<|emo_surprise|> I can imagine, this last week was absolutely wild."
183,<|emo_surprise|> Oh god no.
184,<|emo_surprise|> I thought she was a doctor and was shocked she told you this
185,<|emo_surprise|> oh my gosh
186,<|emo_surprise|> Wow she took her shirt off and exposing her butt. Wonder what happened to her?
187,<|emo_surprise|> It's honestly the only joke I hear about him that isn't met with snarky laughter.
188,<|emo_surprise|> This is an absolutely amazing and terrifying fact
189,<|emo_surprise|> Oh yeah I forgot about that! I had an interview with him once about it. I'd love to hear more about it
190,<|emo_surprise|> What a fucking n
191,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm thinking. Poor [NAME].
192,"<|emo_surprise|> Really surprised I have to look this up. Thanks for the info, I'll definitely check it out!"
193,<|emo_surprise|> Wow!!!
194,"<|emo_surprise|> A surprise, but a welcome one"
195,<|emo_surprise|> Happy birthday!
196,<|emo_surprise|> I feel for you and my heart melted.
197,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, the top comment is from a young woman who just wants the freedom. Congratulations! And there you have it it."
198,<|emo_surprise|> Wow is this a thing? I‚Äôm a fan of both series. Thanks for the help!
199,"<|emo_surprise|> It had a slightly different feel to me, I think I was also agitated for no reason"
200,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh I didn‚Äôt see that, thanks. The reason I have a problem at work is because of social anxiety."
201,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is crazy
202,<|emo_surprise|> Oh. Right
203,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I'm glad that you called it off. That would have been absolutely horrible."
204,<|emo_surprise|> Oh really?
205,<|emo_surprise|> Oh no! Somebody's trying to steal from this shop!
206,<|emo_surprise|> i feel amazing after
207,<|emo_surprise|> i feel curious about life
208,<|emo_surprise|> omg yes lol
209,<|emo_surprise|> im pretty confident in saying that i am without feeling suspicious
211,<|emo_surprise|> I don't know how [NAME] is that. He looks so young.
212,<|emo_surprise|> Well it‚Äôs my first time doing that! I‚Äôm so happy! Did you do it today?
213,<|emo_surprise|> You're a weirdo too lmao
214,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like im making a joke every five seconds just to remind you it has taken you this long to get anything done
215,<|emo_surprise|> Oh ok sorry
216,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I'd be surprised if they even had a sub-reddit for this"
217,"<|emo_surprise|> [RELIGION] makes no sense anymore, it's an abomination, and the overwhelming majority of [RELIGION] countries are doing great since de jure and de facto de facto is over!"
218,<|emo_surprise|> The fact that it's been three years and we still haven't had a female president is pretty astounding.
219,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! What a surprise.
220,<|emo_surprise|> i must tell you that i made it through three of those times feeling really surprised i woke up still thinking and feeling amazing
221,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh!!!
222,<|emo_surprise|> i feel dazed a lot actually when i wake up from my nap
223,<|emo_surprise|> i like to think ill done with it but this made me feel weird
224,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, how did a college coach lose all of his players this week?"
225,<|emo_surprise|> Whoosh lol
226,"<|emo_surprise|> They don't need any more votes lol, thanks for being upvoted."
227,<|emo_surprise|> i can feel strange
228,<|emo_surprise|> What a weird way to find out
229,<|emo_surprise|> The only thing I can think of is she's been tortured and faces execution
230,<|emo_surprise|> WTH? Just awful.
231,<|emo_surprise|> > We can't be bothered What a wonderful irony.
232,<|emo_surprise|> And he‚Äôs not even [NAME] lol
233,<|emo_surprise|> This is the first time I‚Äôve ever felt like this. I‚Äôm so glad your okay.
234,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow! I thought you could not do that?
235,<|emo_surprise|> What a crazy story. I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs true!
236,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that was a close game. [NAME] is always a threat tho
237,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is a weirdo.
238,"<|emo_surprise|> It makes sense. If he was, he'd probably try to trade [NAME] who he sees as lowballing him."
239,<|emo_surprise|> You know where it is. The one with [NAME] and [NAME] are on the far side.
240,<|emo_surprise|> i still feel shocked i was thinking about this
241,"<|emo_surprise|> I was surprised, but not shocked, to read the percent change with age. "
242,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]
243,<|emo_surprise|> oh [NAME] is that you
244,<|emo_surprise|> I was surprised too
245,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] was a pleasant surprise
246,<|emo_surprise|> I am honestly wondering what happened. It was just over a week ago and now I am wondering if there was a bomb under his car.
247,<|emo_surprise|> If this is real I‚Äôll be suprised to see a news story about it.
248,<|emo_surprise|> i feel amazed the way i was able to change my situation
249,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like im actually one of those wonderful people even when im not
250,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow i never knew about the bunk bed, what a valuable tool üòÇ"
251,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow.
252,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, your dad doesn‚Äôt believe in climate change. Wow, what aleonard"
253,<|emo_surprise|> What? And you're upset for his wife? Was your husband being too picky with his words?
254,<|emo_surprise|> Ah what a night.
255,<|emo_surprise|> I didn't even really notice until I looked at my stats. Thanks for the info.
256,"<|emo_surprise|> It was funny until they started to talk about what a ""douchebag"" [NAME] is"
257,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised Bournemouth have kept Bowness up this long. I had forgotten they've been without a keeper for over a month now.
258,<|emo_surprise|> Wow did not even know of that. I wonder what an XDARP is.
259,<|emo_surprise|> i can t help but feel completely overwhelmed by all the things that are going on around me
260,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling curious and curious about the world
261,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that was a thing
262,<|emo_surprise|> i don t think i would feel as amazed today
263,"<|emo_surprise|> Lol. Well, it wasnt because of her, it was because of [NAME]"
264,<|emo_surprise|> I think I see some flesh there.
265,<|emo_surprise|> Oh whoops haha
266,<|emo_surprise|> And I didn't know that! I'm still very surprised did it though!
267,<|emo_surprise|> What a great photo! Congratulations! I was also petulant. I'll take it down a few more times.
268,<|emo_surprise|> Oh no you didn't!
269,<|emo_surprise|> Thanks I just didn‚Äôt know and then I clicked on it and now I‚Äôm crying
270,<|emo_surprise|> You are amazing! Thank you
271,<|emo_surprise|> OMG there‚Äôs a twist. What a nightmare. üòÇ
272,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how [NAME] dealt with the deafening critics. He had them number crating his Every Move!!!
273,<|emo_surprise|> Wow so you've finally joined the rest of the social justice warriors on here huh? Cool
274,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, the news tonight is really interesting. "
275,<|emo_surprise|> i didn t feel amazed that the earth is round compared to stars
276,<|emo_surprise|> Omg I had no idea this was happening! So cringy. I must of just stayed in bed like a year ago haha
277,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how long it took for [NAME] to get that out of her system?
279,"<|emo_surprise|> The first half ended with [NAME] notching back up [NAME], [NAME] or [NAME], it was amazing"
280,"<|emo_surprise|> If it is [NAME], why is it namedafter him...."
281,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, my gosh! That's a horrible take. You're so right. BOTH have their flaws."
282,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder why we've only had one season in which [NAME] is less physically talented than [NAME]
283,<|emo_surprise|> This is a horrible idea
284,<|emo_surprise|> Oh look another shit call
285,<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit.....
286,<|emo_surprise|> I had no idea he worked as an editor there.
287,<|emo_surprise|> i feel pretty strange
288,<|emo_surprise|> I can‚Äôt believe a woman who is literally just months old is afraid to take her own life.
289,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised the video doesn‚Äôt mention it was a sting.
290,<|emo_surprise|> Is this a real thing? I‚Äôd love to do it.
291,<|emo_surprise|> Oh no! Your favorite meme is being insulted like that! Wtf is wrong with you?!?!?!?
292,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I didn't know. My mistake.
293,"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is really just a shade of red. I like her a lot, but I think she could really use some work."
294,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I thought it was just a picture of me, wasn't it?"
295,<|emo_surprise|> i feel shocked and surprised actually
296,<|emo_surprise|> Wow she's gorgeous
297,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, what a story."
298,"<|emo_surprise|> And I didn‚Äôt watch it, so I can‚Äôt say anything. The reason I left is because it looked really bad for me."
299,<|emo_surprise|> omg yes 
300,<|emo_surprise|> Woooooo hee!
301,<|emo_surprise|> i feel kind of strange
302,<|emo_surprise|> Wow they're actually running out of plastic to replace these defective ones tbh
303,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm so thrilled to hear... [NAME] is the only one who could save him.
304,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you have no clue what a ban on talking about our foreign policy to non-Americans means."
305,<|emo_surprise|> i feel overwhelmed with all of the things i have to do
306,"<|emo_surprise|> *honey, you were a child* I'm not crying"
308,<|emo_surprise|> Lol this is the first time I‚Äôve ever seen someone post this‚Äôs on Reddit... I totally thought it was just my mom
309,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. That's good to know. Thanks for the correction.
310,"<|emo_surprise|> Weird that most people who were in the water and saw the manhole cover, did not report it."
311,<|emo_surprise|> Who killed them?
312,<|emo_surprise|> Oh. My heart!
313,<|emo_surprise|> omg i feel your pain
314,<|emo_surprise|> Wow thanks. Wasn't sure I was talking to the dead man
315,<|emo_surprise|> What is scary?
316,<|emo_surprise|> oh my god
317,<|emo_surprise|> What a strange thing to say.
318,<|emo_surprise|> This is a fascinating Take My Penis. I wonder what it's like to write in this style.
319,<|emo_surprise|> You sound like your sister.
320,<|emo_surprise|> The internet never disappoints.
321,<|emo_surprise|> And then the news never did cover it. What a story.
322,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is getting a lot of hype and some people are confused why he doesn‚Äôt get more attention.
323,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling amazed at myself but for some reason i feel amazed at my brain
324,<|emo_surprise|> I always thought of [NAME] as a [NAME] kinda guy. I hope this works out for him.
325,<|emo_surprise|> i just feel the feeling
327,<|emo_surprise|> That is odd. Some people's minds are quite clear.
328,<|emo_surprise|> oh [NAME] it wasnt light!
329,<|emo_surprise|> What the hell. I'm about to teach my son a thing or two about online games...
330,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh you didn't, didn't you? Nope. You took a course inescription and reading. "
333,<|emo_surprise|> This is a good point about not seeing the mistake until after the chat was done. Not to be rude at your boyfriend but I understand how it would feel. ;)
334,<|emo_surprise|> Damn I see [NAME] at 3 on the YMLE atm lol
335,<|emo_surprise|> WOW OMG I love these kinds of dates. Who initiated??
336,<|emo_surprise|> Thanks! That's so generous! It really means a lot to him.
337,<|emo_surprise|> i could go on and on about this but i feel very helpless to do anything about it
338,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. So you are not fromique if you say that.
339,<|emo_surprise|> i always thought he was really cool lol
340,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. Thank you!
341,<|emo_surprise|> Happy birthday you barefoot bitch!
342,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, this is really creepy."
343,<|emo_surprise|> The most amazing thing about this is that the person who posted this to r/politics is running for public office.
344,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that‚Äôs a lot of karma
345,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that was insane"
346,<|emo_surprise|> Ohhhhh yeah that
347,<|emo_surprise|> That's great news! Thanks for sharing the news. Have a good one.
348,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow!
349,<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe he came in and 4 seasons in he managed to turn the team into this.
350,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I‚Äôm doing some work today!
351,"<|emo_surprise|> >How to handle these kinds of situations Well you need to be a [NAME], a doctor. I don't fucking care"
352,<|emo_surprise|> i didnt feel shocked at all
353,<|emo_surprise|> wow the number 3 in the morning is more powerful than the laws of nature
354,"<|emo_surprise|> Hey guys, welcome to the party."
355,<|emo_surprise|> i always feel amazed when people say that they feel the way they do
356,<|emo_surprise|> OMG I can‚Äôt believe this team beat us yesterday.
357,<|emo_surprise|> You‚Äôre an angry elf
358,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised [NAME] didn't say something about the crowd being ""over"" if we were playing behinds"""
359,"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah, they may not realize they're getting a free month. I'm sure he's thrilled about that."
360,<|emo_surprise|> Omg so incredibly cringe-worthy
361,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling all surprised that im still blogging even with this
362,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow what a find! I saw it on YouTube and thought ""I wonder what that is"""
363,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I've never seen so many deleted comments"
364,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wait...did I mention they're paying $4500 to have an artist come in to work for them
365,<|emo_surprise|> oh my [NAME]
366,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG. Just my opinion, btw üòâ üòâ"
367,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I‚Äôm surprised everyone thinks this is real. Maybe he‚Äôs just crazy."
368,<|emo_surprise|> Lol what a gift!
369,<|emo_surprise|> i really did feel a bit weird
370,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, your sister is a doctor. I love reading these kinds of posts. Thanks for the info, I see where you are coming from!"
371,"<|emo_surprise|> I knew it! Wait, no...."
372,"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] has made some really good plays against Houston lately, and I‚Äôm really starting to like him. "
373,<|emo_surprise|> The saddest thing is that you are right. We need a new law to protect women.
374,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that was fast"
375,<|emo_surprise|> OMG!!!
376,<|emo_surprise|> What a fucking autist!
377,<|emo_surprise|> This was one of my first posts on the new subreddit. I'm just SHOWN THE PICTURE!
378,"<|emo_surprise|> So we really do have a date. It's not like we all just ""get together"""
379,<|emo_surprise|> Omg I can't be the only one who thought the same
380,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like there are too many people who are so excited about this and think it somehow less serious than it really is
381,"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME], I love that this is happening. We need to pressure the hotels and have a good presence at the pump"
382,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised she didn‚Äôt name him [NAME]
383,"<|emo_surprise|> Yaaaaaas, wow!"
384,<|emo_surprise|> I am stunned
385,<|emo_surprise|> i feel surprised when we saw the place
386,<|emo_surprise|> What???
387,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. That‚Äôs awful. I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss
388,<|emo_surprise|> >How stupid do you have to be to think this Much as I'd love a reply to this
389,"<|emo_surprise|> No wonder he's been called a ""cringeworthy moron"" and ""a man who will never win a championship"" and ""a terrible, terrible owner"" and ""an awful, awful coach"" and ""an awful, awful owner"""
390,<|emo_surprise|> Wow you are quite the romantic...
391,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I guess no one can do anything about the issues, although I agree with you that local government is a lot more important than state government."
392,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, good to know!"
393,<|emo_surprise|> How is that dare I say dare me not show some respect for the lord
394,<|emo_surprise|> It was amazing.
395,<|emo_surprise|> Omg why me
396,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] didn't do us any favours there
397,<|emo_surprise|> Lol you'd think. They're weird AF.
399,<|emo_surprise|> This is what makes Reddit culture so amazing
400,"<|emo_surprise|> Ah yes, I did mention I have no idea what that is!"
401,<|emo_surprise|> Oh damn. Did not know that!
402,<|emo_surprise|> This is amazing!
404,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, he dead"
405,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh, thank you!!!!!"
406,<|emo_surprise|> oh no
407,<|emo_surprise|> i feel funny saying that
408,<|emo_surprise|> i feel surprised how often i forget to add these cute little words to emails
409,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh no, now they're asking for the ages? "
410,"<|emo_surprise|> *shrug* "" About what I expected"""
411,<|emo_surprise|> Oh that was amazing
412,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow
413,<|emo_surprise|> A surprise to be sure. But a welcome one.
414,<|emo_surprise|> It was amazing! And then the commercial break where they went back to the [NAME] scene.
415,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you‚Äùre cool"
416,<|emo_surprise|> That was magic
417,<|emo_surprise|> i didnt even feel that i was amazing at it
418,<|emo_surprise|> That's a surprise from this guy. Looks like you're a fairly well known player
419,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is an interesting guy. I thought he played defense for a bit but I wonder what he's all about.
420,<|emo_surprise|> Why everyone is going out of their way to find this?
422,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, I would call the police!"
423,<|emo_surprise|> I would have bet anything that the judge in question is a biased jurist because he is not from a different state.
424,<|emo_surprise|> Oh the horror.
425,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gawd!!
426,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, your brother is in recovery! "
427,<|emo_surprise|> i hope that ill be living with my beloved at an address we can discuss and agree upon a cost
428,<|emo_surprise|> i can t help but be slightly distressed that i feel a little less likeable and less friendly than i do normally
429,<|emo_surprise|> Happy Cake day baby!
430,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] did us wrong. Let us know how this all played out for you in the comments below
431,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised [NAME] let him post that.
433,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I miss [NAME]
434,<|emo_surprise|> Oh noooo I‚Äôm getting flashbacks to that nightmare
435,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a little surprised i havent seen this list but it should be!
436,<|emo_surprise|> That was a huge contributing factor in why we went with [NAME]. I'm surprised he's letting it go as long as it could.
437,<|emo_surprise|> Just realized there are more ‚Äúniggers‚Äù in the world than ‚Äúwhite‚Äù people. This must be a wake up call.
438,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, he actually came out and said that ""I don't know why, but [NAME] said we."" Wow, I‚Äôm so glad "
439,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh and just in case you forgot, RIP /u/kangaroojoey"
440,<|emo_surprise|> Omg [NAME] just won two calder
441,<|emo_surprise|> Wow you have quite the sense of humor
443,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised [NAME] let her post that
444,<|emo_surprise|> This is so cool! I love the hat!
445,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling a little more appreciative
446,<|emo_surprise|> It sure sounds like she did. I'm pretty stunned
447,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow if you are going to say something anti political then I suggest you get an ""out"" and stop being an angry agitator."
448,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] damn you are autistic
449,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is a terrible writer.
450,<|emo_surprise|> Oh the joys of Marine Corps boot camp!!
451,"<|emo_surprise|> What a game, won't let anyone else in!"
452,<|emo_surprise|> What a joke omg
453,<|emo_surprise|> Wow they did it again
454,<|emo_surprise|> i wouldnt mind if they got him and didnt have him around like that forever but i could understand if he isnt happy then thats pretty hard to live with
455,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling rather doubtful of almost everything you said until now
456,<|emo_surprise|> OMG!!
457,<|emo_surprise|> I've been saying that since the very first one. At the time it was the best game in the world and people still went crazy for it.
458,<|emo_surprise|> i feel the shock and surprise of this news
461,<|emo_surprise|> This is the one that got away
462,"<|emo_surprise|> Hey, [NAME] is still here!"
463,<|emo_surprise|> I couldn‚Äôt believe they actually got married.
464,"<|emo_surprise|> How about a hug? As much as I'd love it, I can barely hug myself."
465,<|emo_surprise|> What a surprise i never saw coming
466,<|emo_surprise|> It's oddly comforting to have someone else's money.
467,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised she could operate a suitcase.
468,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling so overwhelmed
469,<|emo_surprise|> I have no idea what you're on about but I love your enthusiasm. I wish I could be there in person!
470,<|emo_surprise|> He gets really agitated at the end of videos. Omg
471,<|emo_surprise|> Damn that‚Äôs some good fucking words
472,"<|emo_surprise|> Thanks, I was wondering what that was...I used to really enjoy watching his videos"
473,<|emo_surprise|> Thanks I almost forgot about the tbh
474,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised it's still happening despite the threats of an invasion of manbij.
475,<|emo_surprise|> Why are you in the mood for a bromance!
476,<|emo_surprise|> I have nothing to offer you today but mine... **should've' ended there**
477,<|emo_surprise|> i remember feeling really dazed and confused and then we walked off in a different direction again
478,<|emo_surprise|> She‚Äôs creepy
479,<|emo_surprise|> Omg I‚Äôm doing a BOTH today! Have us some s'mores!
480,<|emo_surprise|> i feel really strange watching this
481,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, was that through your video connection? Cause I definitely went to check the Hulu Plus videos..."
482,<|emo_surprise|> That is wild. Have they all had their meetnas banned yet?
483,<|emo_surprise|> I never actually heard that before but I totally agree. She was just doing her job honestly. And I thought it was handled perfectly.
484,"<|emo_surprise|> How about [NAME], who was literally making 15 an hour?"
485,<|emo_surprise|> And what a thot you are. Wow you are more degenerate than most at your age.
486,<|emo_surprise|> i feel very amused and helpless
487,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh
488,<|emo_surprise|> She just reminded me how important it is to stay positive
489,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh yeah, someone took the poster, turned it into a drawing, and posted it there"
490,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if the old folks who used to play baseball in these holes would be shocked to hear this story.
491,<|emo_surprise|> What a weird thing to say.
492,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] I thought it was the other [NAME]
493,<|emo_surprise|> My favorite!!! She talks about how she is so nervous about the whole thing
494,<|emo_surprise|> oh shitttt there it is
495,<|emo_surprise|> I'm shocked [NAME] let her post that
496,<|emo_surprise|> i feel amazed and honored like a golden lotus
497,<|emo_surprise|> Ah well I'll see about that...
498,<|emo_surprise|> Omg. I did the same exact thing! I didn't wanna think about it too much. Just a panic response üòî
499,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG! There is a hidden camera on that Wow, no line"
500,<|emo_surprise|> This surprised me
501,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, now you're mad"
502,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs a lot of bp! So I‚Äôm glad that you left to find a wife who‚Äôs into your fetish.
503,<|emo_surprise|> Omg that sounds like it‚Äôs gonna be a fucking monster movie
504,<|emo_surprise|> You‚Äôre the same person who didn‚Äôt believe [NAME] when he said he wanted a relationship for our relationship and that he loved me
505,<|emo_surprise|> OMG the bra hanging out of the back of that dress looks like rusted tools.
506,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, what a steal that was"
507,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG! I thought you said ‚Äú12 years, wow, not even close to 12‚Äù?! Your wrong."
508,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling a little overwhelmed and just a little sad
509,<|emo_surprise|> The way they both are shooting... I hope they catch the shooter
510,<|emo_surprise|> i feel more surprised than anything that i get emails asking i can shoot live action with my video camera
511,<|emo_surprise|> i wonder how that is and i feel curious and skeptical of the evidence
512,<|emo_surprise|> I always wondered if the characters from Persona 3 would turn into Haikus.
513,<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe he said this.
514,<|emo_surprise|> Damn you are autistic
515,<|emo_surprise|> My jaw dropped
516,<|emo_surprise|> It's not surprising that a lot of kids do it. It's even more surprising that the adults are the ones who are ashamed.
517,<|emo_surprise|> Can't help it lol
518,<|emo_surprise|> Wow what a surprise i didn‚Äôt know about [NAME].
519,<|emo_surprise|> They all talk soo much ftw
520,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, now you're asking me if I'm interested "
521,"<|emo_surprise|> That's crazy, I always seen people complaining about that..."
522,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I'm sorry you had a bad experience but I actually really don't see any of them doing anything illegal
523,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh! I didn't even recognize [NAME]!
524,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like i didn t have anything useful to say before my eyes were closed and i can t imagine that i might have any productive thought right now
525,<|emo_surprise|> i feel curious about the universe
526,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised [NAME] didn‚Äôt have a chance to speak
527,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] that's so terrible... I loved [NAME]. So he can hold her.
528,<|emo_surprise|> This is amazing. I love how she also appears to the camera without a shirt on. Awesome
529,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, your sister is in abusive relationship. Amazing move to step down"
531,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh cool, I heard the same thing (but slightly more recently)"
532,<|emo_surprise|> Lmao wow I didn‚Äôt even know that was possible! I‚Äôm glad someone noticed it
534,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, congratulations!! Hugs "
535,<|emo_surprise|> Wow the comments are coming thick and fast.
536,<|emo_surprise|> I do not believe you've ever seen [NAME] play. I'm wondering what changed for you in your mind/opinions? Please be as brief as you can.
537,"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, this is dope"
538,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, what a steal that was"
539,<|emo_surprise|> Is that the real thing? I love adventurousASTRO shoes!
540,<|emo_surprise|> Omg what a shock i never saw coming
541,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, how have we come to be so self-absorbed?"
542,<|emo_surprise|> What the heck?!
543,<|emo_surprise|> What a fucking moron
544,"<|emo_surprise|> A shock to the system, but a welcome one"
545,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised there isn't more online support!
546,<|emo_surprise|> It was [NAME]!
547,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. She's literally 40 years old.
549,<|emo_surprise|> Oh the horror!
550,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder why they're single?
551,<|emo_surprise|> I don't know about you but I would be happy to vote for any of the above
552,<|emo_surprise|> i feel shocked a bit surprised that he calls himself a christian
553,<|emo_surprise|> im not feeling any less impressed
554,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you are quite the romantic..."
555,<|emo_surprise|> Oh that. Weird how easily it could happen haha
557,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh. I made a yankee sauce and ate it tonight. I wonder what would happen if I did that right now.
558,<|emo_surprise|> There it is!
560,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, I didn't know [NAME] had died. RIP"
561,<|emo_surprise|> Thanks for that. I don't really know how to think this other way. It's just not healthy but it's also not as bad as you're making it out to be
562,<|emo_surprise|> You are absolutely correct. Now is the best time for everyone to have sex. You may think I'm insane for saying that though. Love your posts. -Happy new year everyone.
563,<|emo_surprise|> What a strange post omg
564,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh sorry, I misread"
565,<|emo_surprise|> I actually did that üò£ I was wondering how. I think I may have shot myself in the foot.
566,<|emo_surprise|> Why is that [NAME] face on here I‚Äôm shocked
567,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I‚Äôd be surprised if it was this easy. What did you do?"
569,<|emo_surprise|> My son told me he thinks it was a.50 cal round
570,<|emo_surprise|> Can‚Äôt wait to hear that as well
571,<|emo_surprise|> Really wondering why they're getting a whole lot worse....
572,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, there go the mortars"
573,"<|emo_surprise|> Is it weird my dad calls me ""sweetie daddy?"""
574,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you must've never been on reddit, before you wrote this I couldn't believe it!"
575,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, can‚Äôt believe this shit actually worked"
576,<|emo_surprise|> Omg the face
577,"<|emo_surprise|> Haha, I'll be more careful about it later. Thank you."
579,"<|emo_surprise|> I think I'm actually going to start asking kids if they would like to be sent to preschool tomorrow rn, I‚Äôm so surprised I didn‚Äôt see that before"
580,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you‚Äôre not wrong..."
582,<|emo_surprise|> Oh shit. Didnt know they had a rewards program.
583,<|emo_surprise|> I was also under the impression it was *100%* digital. I was surprised!
584,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised he didn't say he saw it while they were eating
585,<|emo_surprise|> Can‚Äôt believe people like this actually exist.
586,<|emo_surprise|> oh [NAME]
587,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is scary
588,<|emo_surprise|> Hey guys this is [NAME]!
589,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Thanks for the correction, I really thought I had it wrong."
590,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling a bit amazed actually
591,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]! I can‚Äôt believe she‚Äôs finally admitting she loves him! [NAME]!
592,<|emo_surprise|> I was wondering what the sub‚Äôs average age was :/
593,<|emo_surprise|> Yikes that's cringe
594,<|emo_surprise|> i think i m feeling a little overwhelmed
596,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like im watching a movie where the hero falls and im not surprised
597,<|emo_surprise|> I'm impressed that the City Council didn't pass an amendment to the city's charter that specifically bars the sale and use of assault guns. That's amazing.
598,<|emo_surprise|> This is one of the most shocking things I've read today. I love Reddit.
599,"<|emo_surprise|> How have you not seen this before? I'm not sure what's more disgusting, the parents having their kid act like an adult being a kid or the disgusting parents."
600,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, the title of the post made my night. Gotta love Reddit."
601,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, your wife isn't surprised though, is she?"
602,"<|emo_surprise|> Heh, I can't believe he actually threatened to shut down the government over a funding deal..."
603,<|emo_surprise|> Lmao I'm shocked she didn't say the N-word.
604,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME]. Do we have a video of this?
605,<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit.
606,<|emo_surprise|> That's a big meal.
608,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, now I am sad"
609,"<|emo_surprise|> The man wearing that hat looks just as startled as you do, but with a slightly different voice."
610,<|emo_surprise|> Oh stop IT
611,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling a little skeptical about this one
612,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised they got away with it because of how ridiculous the offer was.
613,<|emo_surprise|> Wow we played a lot of positions tonight
614,<|emo_surprise|> Omg no way [NAME] never said that!
615,<|emo_surprise|> Wow the only two that will get there are [NAME] and [NAME] so... how odd.
616,<|emo_surprise|> I think I'm in love
617,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Never thought of that before. Thanks for sharing!
618,<|emo_surprise|> OMG the one inking dude is super excited!
619,<|emo_surprise|> i feel this way i may have gone crazy at this point
620,<|emo_surprise|> Holy damn I had to like these before I knew about Reddit culture
621,<|emo_surprise|> i feel amazed to know that they can do what they are doing
622,"<|emo_surprise|> I actually didn't read all of it, but I saw something about him being a mixed race person and it made me SHARE"
623,"<|emo_surprise|> Thanks, I am so sorry! üòÇ"
624,<|emo_surprise|> i dont know how id feel if we didn t get her that year
625,<|emo_surprise|> The only good news I came away with is that he's not dead.
626,<|emo_surprise|> Omg are you fcking serious sis
627,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs a really good point. I‚Äôm gonna try that.
628,<|emo_surprise|> And the original fan voted for him! He was definitely the worse.
629,<|emo_surprise|> i can feel the way it feels not being impressed by him but still skeptical
630,<|emo_surprise|> Omg yes!
631,<|emo_surprise|> Wow he finally found home
632,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME], this is the fucking worst. "
635,<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is amazingly disturbing. Who are these people? And what are they doing in their free time?
636,<|emo_surprise|> My girlfriend and I went way back but we did it. We went from barely knowing each other to 4 years together haha.
637,<|emo_surprise|> Wow... I did not know [NAME] had a sonogram.
638,"<|emo_surprise|> I have no idea what exactly it is about this, maybe it's the music..."
639,"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah. You see the guy on the outside of the buildings a lot, just barely visible. It's odd."
640,<|emo_surprise|> OMG where did that sink come from??
641,<|emo_surprise|> That is... Interesting. [NAME] was indeed a bit of a nutter back in the day though
642,<|emo_surprise|> OMG this has to be a joke...
644,<|emo_surprise|> Oh. My gosh
645,<|emo_surprise|> He got his ass handed to him
646,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] this is horrifying
647,<|emo_surprise|> i also dont think he feels impressed
648,<|emo_surprise|> i know the feeling of being overwhelmed by something
649,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. What a weird thing to say.
650,<|emo_surprise|> Damn....
651,<|emo_surprise|> Oh and their hair - it stayed!
652,<|emo_surprise|> i didnt know i just really didnt feel very impressed then
653,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME], yesssss."
654,<|emo_surprise|> i was left feeling impressed and surprised
655,<|emo_surprise|> OMG kids are dying from polio?? And the cure was a thin sheet of glass???
656,<|emo_surprise|> Omg I cringed so hard watching this
657,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like a bit of a dreamer lately because i ve never used an app for gaming
658,<|emo_surprise|> i feel curious curious curious curious
659,<|emo_surprise|> Wow so true! How are you I don't know
660,<|emo_surprise|> i can feel it more and more my heart starts to race excited wondering if god is on my side
661,<|emo_surprise|> So much fear and wonder
662,<|emo_surprise|> Wow.....
663,<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs an amazing feeling actually
664,<|emo_surprise|> Wow.
665,"<|emo_surprise|> What a great video, thanks for sharing it"
666,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh good grief, is that it?"
667,"<|emo_surprise|> Lol. I didnt know about Reddit. I just saw about it and thought ""fool me twice""."
668,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised you couldn't find a picture of him with a gun.
669,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, great news for her."
670,"<|emo_surprise|> Weird flex, but ok"
671,<|emo_surprise|> Omg does anyone know if there is a list of YouTube personalities/segments that aren't paid appearance fees?
672,<|emo_surprise|> There are a lot of us [NAME]. It's strange that these lefty crybabies are the loudest but most opinionated minority.
673,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised you didn't try to contact them to find out more.
674,<|emo_surprise|> Wow they took it off the road so close to my home. That's pretty bad tbh
675,<|emo_surprise|> Oh absolutely! It‚Äôs been a while since I'veatched that episode. So much laughter.
676,"<|emo_surprise|> I don't actually read Reddit anymore, but I sure know a guy who does."
677,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow she looks really pretty!
678,<|emo_surprise|> Whoaaaaaaaaaa!
679,<|emo_surprise|> The one where [NAME] blows up a damsel in distress. I love it.
680,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is actually a weirdo.. I‚Äôm surprised it‚Äôs still happening lol
681,"<|emo_surprise|> And finally, the person telling the truth."
682,<|emo_surprise|> Why all the downvotes? It's fucking reddit.
683,<|emo_surprise|> The level of support you have for this is absolutely astounding
684,<|emo_surprise|> Lol I had a similar thought about that. That would add even more to what is already there.
685,<|emo_surprise|> i just never thought im that much of a girl but i have noticed just how much of a boy i am
686,"<|emo_surprise|> The guy who is [NAME], I can't believe I'm on Reddit with such high hopes."
688,"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]! What, again?"
689,<|emo_surprise|> Holy rooster that bastard
690,<|emo_surprise|> i feel curious wondering how it happened when the story broke of all the books she loved and had never even heard of then but it happened and now i am left with aching for all the things i once knew
691,<|emo_surprise|> OMG now I‚Äôm crying before work thanks a lot! üí™
692,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised she didn't say it was because it was disgusting and disgusting!
693,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] damn I love ten min power hour xd
694,<|emo_surprise|> Hahaha I love it
695,<|emo_surprise|> I didn' t see that üòÇ
696,<|emo_surprise|> i had been feeling a bit apprehensive after seeing the movie
697,<|emo_surprise|> This is how you get a fascist to speak to you :D
698,<|emo_surprise|> i feel extremely reluctant to give up control on the car to someone who did so again and i could not be bothered
699,<|emo_surprise|> oh there goes time
700,"<|emo_surprise|> The weird thing is, I‚Äôm a pretty regular player... Did not expect Oblivion to have a support class special ability for ars magi"
701,<|emo_surprise|> What a fucking idiot lol
702,<|emo_surprise|> Ohhhhh yeah
703,<|emo_surprise|> Omg what a cuck!
704,<|emo_surprise|> I'm shocked it lived long enough to get that artdeco look.
705,<|emo_surprise|> What a cataclysm
706,<|emo_surprise|> Wow she actually said this lol
707,<|emo_surprise|> It's weird that the only toolbox available to you is a hammer?
708,<|emo_surprise|> What the hell was that pass. That was magic
709,<|emo_surprise|> It doesn't surprise me given that all the media attention it's gotten in the past months has focused on him.
711,<|emo_surprise|> I honestly don't know what it is but I'm loving the new song.
712,<|emo_surprise|> My surprise. Still surprised at how quickly they abandoned it.
713,<|emo_surprise|> How did she know?? Oh god oh fuck
714,<|emo_surprise|> i feel curious about the meaning behind this blog name
715,<|emo_surprise|> Really the surprising amount of effort and passion these guys have. It's not something you see everyday.
717,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, I didn't notice that either before you pointed it out."
718,<|emo_surprise|> Damn so glad I moved here
719,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. There I go. I thought this was an old chestnut
720,<|emo_surprise|> The only thing I'm mad about is the fan art. I really enjoyed drawn Hellraiser as a kid.
721,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling kind of weird tonight
723,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, I didn't know this history was as fascinating as it sounds. Thanks for sharing."
724,<|emo_surprise|> I hope he keeps at it. I‚Äôm so happy for him but would hate it too
725,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is a terrible option for me though.
726,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs the only war we lost.
727,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder why the fuck out of Hereford. I love the place but it‚Äôs full of assholes. 
728,<|emo_surprise|> i am so happy that theyre taking it seriously and i feel so helpless as a parent with my son
729,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised [NAME] not got intoology
730,<|emo_surprise|> i never feel more amazed
731,<|emo_surprise|> There's something genuinely horrifying about this.
732,<|emo_surprise|> Oh geez
734,<|emo_surprise|> What happened??? That is never on my to do list.... what the fuck
735,<|emo_surprise|> Oh no.
736,<|emo_surprise|> I have never seen that comment and I am honestly shocked that you think it is.
737,"<|emo_surprise|> I mean, it was news to me that he's actually working with them."
738,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I thought your post was about the wrong subreddit
739,<|emo_surprise|> i feel very overwhelmed by the whole thing and completely unable to think about anything
741,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh no, didn't see it"
742,<|emo_surprise|> That's actually a lot of calories! Gotta eat a little less lol
743,"<|emo_surprise|> Omg I just got a text from one of my close friends saying ""just got a weird text from him...!"" I feel so dumb I felt like doing this."
744,<|emo_surprise|> I'm really shocked they made it fit the car like that I mean the roof's on the small side but seriously I'm really surprised 
745,<|emo_surprise|> The most delicious dreams come true
746,<|emo_surprise|> OMG I forgot about the GDT...
747,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh! What about you?
748,"<|emo_surprise|> You are a woman of unbelievable strength and fortitude, someone I would name if I were a man. Truly someone who is something divine."
749,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that is just... Wow, that is just... Wow, that is just... Wow, that is just... Wow "
750,<|emo_surprise|> This. Is the first time I‚Äôm hearing about this. Geez. Glad it‚Äôs just not about me
751,<|emo_surprise|> They're a bit expensive haha
752,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] that's a horrible idea lmao
753,"<|emo_surprise|> Just came back from a week gone by and there's been at least 20 active players, including 2 new signing!!"
754,<|emo_surprise|> Omg she has no idea what to call this
755,<|emo_surprise|> i got home feeling surprised to find joshua here
756,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised not one of them picked up on it
757,"<|emo_surprise|> They also have a separate food prep area with separate tools and food prep tips, amazing! They are also incredibly clean."
759,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I'm so surprised [NAME] let her.
760,<|emo_surprise|> Omg I can‚Äôt imagine not being able to pick one. I miss the old days
761,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised it's that deep :(
762,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling funny
763,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm wondering what that is - [NAME]?
764,<|emo_surprise|> Omg lena heira bit player
765,<|emo_surprise|> And I'm wondering how the heck all those seats are attached to the garage door?
766,<|emo_surprise|> Oh shit yesssss
767,"<|emo_surprise|> It's weird to call a place a home, but a place is a home if it has the ability to take you places."
768,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME]!
769,<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe no one even reacted to it
771,"<|emo_surprise|> Really wow, that was deep."
772,"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]? I don‚Äôt quite get it, is it fellow artist [NAME]?"
773,<|emo_surprise|> i got down to feeling a little surprised i got to work by the time i had finished my last check
774,<|emo_surprise|> I'm not exactly sure what to say but wow thank you. I've wondered what it's like to have no friends
775,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, I see it now"
776,<|emo_surprise|> i feel something i don t understand
777,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised she didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúnow you are going to put your vagina where my friend‚Äù
778,<|emo_surprise|> What a strange man
779,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I was not expecting the tldr, and am very happy for you. :)"
780,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling really unsure about some of the major points in this book
781,<|emo_surprise|> Damn these refs actually fucking hate us.
782,<|emo_surprise|> i just got home and saw the picture and not knowing what to do anything im very surprised at how big the hole in his stomach still left feeling and i think ive ever felt before
783,<|emo_surprise|> I had no idea [NAME] was a vegan! ( Unless he was)
784,"<|emo_surprise|> What surprise. He's been around for a while now, has never even been on our team sheet."
785,<|emo_surprise|> Whoa this shirt is cosy
786,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Maybe you should take some time to read through this list, maybe others like it too. Wow. "
787,<|emo_surprise|> i could go on with a list of the ways my body has changed in the past year how it has changed in the 12 days since i was feeling completely amazed at how strong and powerful it has gotten how it has become a whole much more amazing body
788,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow thanks, I've never seen this before. I think it's amazing."
789,<|emo_surprise|> My parents did this for 10 years. I had no idea back then.
791,<|emo_surprise|> Is that a penis or a vagina? It's kinda hard to tell because they both look the same to me.
792,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like im a stranger in no way close or friendly to anyone
793,<|emo_surprise|> The way they wrote it made me think they were writing to some guy in a club who was like Oh shit that's so romantic!
794,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm shocked we didn‚Äôt take him back...
795,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm so happy for you. You have the right attitude, and you've done what I told you."
797,<|emo_surprise|> What in the actual fuck?
798,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised the man filming didn‚Äôt see this..
799,"<|emo_surprise|> My god what a gift, that's what I call a gift"
800,<|emo_surprise|> Oh god a triple
801,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow you‚Äôre one cool dude
802,<|emo_surprise|> My 2 favorites üî•
803,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, this sounds like the future. Where will all the jobs be?"
804,"<|emo_surprise|> A surprise, is what you would expect from a team that missed the playoffs last season. "
805,<|emo_surprise|> This is amazingly unsatisfying.
806,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that‚Äôs the only war we lost.
807,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like im the weird one
808,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, I thought you liked [NAME]"
809,<|emo_surprise|> They must really hate going outside in summer.
810,<|emo_surprise|> I don't know why but the face in that drawing really does remind me of a very creepy Arendt study about [NAME].
811,<|emo_surprise|> Ahhh ok sorry
812,<|emo_surprise|> WTH? Just insane
813,<|emo_surprise|> What happened?
814,<|emo_surprise|> i feel amazing
815,<|emo_surprise|> This makes me wonder what would happen if we actually passed the 40 yard line and [NAME] had thrown a TD to [NAME]
816,<|emo_surprise|> I like this one
817,<|emo_surprise|> i think i am feeling pretty amazed at the things i know about myself
818,<|emo_surprise|> Omg that was the WORST
819,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised it's not a full-screen game
820,<|emo_surprise|> OMG! A 4-pack! That's awesome!
821,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh!!
822,"<|emo_surprise|> wow, you actually did it..."
823,"<|emo_surprise|> How unfortunate, but it's unlikely to ever happen."
824,"<|emo_surprise|> Thanks, I have a few words of advice I can use to ease your pain; may be I've already tried them myself, so advice may be helpful. "
825,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. I didn't know they changed that after the Netflix case.
826,<|emo_surprise|> I was surprised to see they stock photos are still online though.
827,<|emo_surprise|> i feel the world is very delicate because sometimes i feel like everything i see is just a mirror to me
828,<|emo_surprise|> Omg I‚Äôd gladly
829,"<|emo_surprise|> Lol, you just posted the same thing but made a ton of sense"
830,<|emo_surprise|> What an awkward way to send a message. Welcome to the internet.
831,<|emo_surprise|> How incredibly dangerous
832,<|emo_surprise|> i feel pretty amazed
833,<|emo_surprise|> omg no way I didn't think of this
834,"<|emo_surprise|> The crazy thing is that even though we aren't spending as much we used to, we are still $11 billion under the budget."
835,<|emo_surprise|> Happy new year!
836,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a little weird about that
837,<|emo_surprise|> Ohhhhh they're so different
838,<|emo_surprise|> omg. I'm really confused. This must have really gone viral. I would have loved to know more about it.
839,<|emo_surprise|> He is??? I thought this was one of the main reasons I was leaving back in May but oh is it!
840,<|emo_surprise|> Wow just wow.
841,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is scared out there. Stay strong
842,<|emo_surprise|> Oh man. Just remember I love you
843,<|emo_surprise|> I was just wondering if that was a reference tom and wondered what the heck that was...
844,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised by how many people can't imagine doing this
846,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I‚Äôm more than pleasantly surprised they didn‚Äôt ask for a copy of the forms. 
847,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I know this is old news but still wow. I wonder if this is why there are no new news threads or what that guy said is false.
848,<|emo_surprise|> OMG he‚Äôs so handsome!
849,<|emo_surprise|> Lmao. I can't believe these are the same people who were shocked when [NAME] won the Miss Congeniality award in 2013.
850,<|emo_surprise|> im here in a different environment where there are so many people who feel so appalled right now by this vote but im here in the same time where im so sick of all the talk and nonsense
851,<|emo_surprise|> Oh for [NAME] sake what the hell did I just read?
852,<|emo_surprise|> That's the first time I‚Äôve seen that in 15 years of watching the show!
853,<|emo_surprise|> Who's a hitman??
854,<|emo_surprise|> This is a good thing. We really need to stop conflating player deaths with overall game levels.
855,<|emo_surprise|> This is amazing! I love this. Thank you for sharing!
856,<|emo_surprise|> He's not crazy
857,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if that's why [NAME] can't speak english fluently - he's got a limited speaking range
858,<|emo_surprise|> i still really dont understand how i feel about people who write but it is definitely something that is ever on our minds and maybe more than ever with dave
859,<|emo_surprise|> I'm honestly shocked the stock market is talking about this.. I can't believe you have to have a 4/20 to lose to slip below.
860,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME].
861,<|emo_surprise|> Oh no the real story is that you can pick your parents first name
862,<|emo_surprise|> He is an amazing and hilarious actor
863,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! What happened? What have I gone crazy for?
864,<|emo_surprise|> i have one question that needs to be asked
865,<|emo_surprise|> You are amazing. Keep up the art.
866,<|emo_surprise|> Thanks. It makes me glad that I'm still alive.
867,<|emo_surprise|> Oh no it's not
868,"<|emo_surprise|> It's strange how popular ""DuckTales"" is in this sub. A lot of kids between the ages of 2-11 still remember the show."
869,<|emo_surprise|> How dare you talk about [NAME] with the same energy level as [NAME]
870,<|emo_surprise|> Damn it.
871,<|emo_surprise|> I'm shaking my head
872,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I forgot how awesome [NAME] is!
873,<|emo_surprise|> I can‚Äôt imagine being this retired
875,<|emo_surprise|> i was feeling surprised
876,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh sorry, I didn't know, I'm replying from Reddit."
877,<|emo_surprise|> Wow what a steal that was
878,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you are lucky you don't have to call them the ""cucks"" you think they are."
879,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] is this real
880,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like such a strange one
881,<|emo_surprise|> What an idiot lol
882,"<|emo_surprise|> She‚Äôs like [NAME] from SuperTucson. I hate it as much as the next [NAME], but here is a girl who has a dream and is determined to reach it. "
883,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you‚Äôre mom is a little SHIT hot."
884,<|emo_surprise|> Loved the new intro song but there is a huge meaty hole in the middle that I didn‚Äôt expect.
885,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. I actually really liked this short. What a steal
886,<|emo_surprise|> I like you. No promo
887,<|emo_surprise|> i love this so much
888,<|emo_surprise|> The last post had me laughing. Well written.
889,<|emo_surprise|> Damn. I thought I said they didn‚Äôt know each other yet!
890,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my goodness. That video is absolutely everything we could want out of a horror vs. vampires video.
891,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] has lost it
892,<|emo_surprise|> The only thing that could make him less cringe-worthy than that is a little bit of ketchup thrown on top
893,"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah, that was my immediate thought after seeing the first cut. Weird how all the guys seem to somehow know what to do."
895,<|emo_surprise|> This is such a good tip and is a much better sign that you should probably get vaccinated.udos.
896,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! Thanks! I was really wondering what you were talking about
897,<|emo_surprise|> You must be fun at parties.
898,<|emo_surprise|> Omg i mean it‚Äôs crazy as all hell that people can read your posts and not recognize some pretty obvious references!!!!
899,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. She's so gorgeous!
900,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if that was the one guy who was shocked when they found out the car had insurance.
901,<|emo_surprise|> This is kinda cute OP. I'm also shocked you can link it without spelling out [NAME] as [NAME].
902,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Don't say I didn't warn you...
903,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a little dazed and confused about everything
904,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I'm more than pleasantly surprised at this."
905,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh I didn't realize it was that broad, thanks for the correction."
906,"<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs a nice thought, but does it have to do with the fact that the team that drafts him doesn‚Äôt play him"
907,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] damn it
908,"<|emo_surprise|> You have to give the benefit of the doubt to the healthiest of people, right?"
909,<|emo_surprise|> Omg. This is just me the other day too. I see this post twice a day!! :D
910,<|emo_surprise|> i feel so shocked and delighted i do not know what to do
911,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] I heard they used to do this.. also the ice room used to be a bit of a haunt!
912,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. What a steal that is
913,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is super awkward.
915,<|emo_surprise|> What a strange and wonderful thing to say.
916,<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs a weird thing people do
917,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh no, they're all scamming you"
918,<|emo_surprise|> i still feel completely amazed when i think of how it happened
919,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG! I didn't know someone posted a link to it! Thanks for sharing! Also, just noticed it was a video from this site... http:"
920,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. You are quite the romantic...
923,<|emo_surprise|> Wow what a surprise i never saw coming
924,<|emo_surprise|> Oh shit she just said that? I don't know anything about porn but if she just said a few lines in front of [NAME] I'm shocked by my lack of knowledge.
925,<|emo_surprise|> Well he definitely seems to enjoy trolling his fans on instagram and he has a weird sense of humor which probably helped him grow up. I‚Äôd give him all the points.
926,"<|emo_surprise|> What a strange relationship, [NAME]"
927,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, they are a couple of acts away from being charged under the Family Responsibility and Notification Act"
928,<|emo_surprise|> i find it strange that im just feeling a little overwhelmed
929,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh! A TWENTY TWO PERCENTAGEomer!
930,<|emo_surprise|> There's something you need to know.
931,"<|emo_surprise|> I don't think anyone has ever said ""I don't think [NAME] is going to win"" but it makes a difference."
932,"<|emo_surprise|> Yikes, what a weird thread you're on"
934,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] please no
935,<|emo_surprise|> wow!!!
936,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised no one posted aphy or bradycardia
937,<|emo_surprise|> > It's been said that there's no single group for all of us I've been shocked at how many different opinions there is on this
938,"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, that's the only war we lost."
939,<|emo_surprise|> I'm gonna be surprised if [NAME] doesn't want to go back to them for [NAME].
940,<|emo_surprise|> Is this a real thing? What Does this Have to do with me? What‚Äôs the deal with me?
941,<|emo_surprise|> They would never let him have it.. if he had 6 hands
942,"<|emo_surprise|> What surprised me, was that [NAME] kept saying he liked meeting girls instead of driving."
943,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] I didn't do that. I'd never even think about it... I'll miss him
944,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs so odd to hear; I‚Äôm fairly new to this.
945,<|emo_surprise|> What did he do to deserve that? He's been a valued member of our community for 20 years. Can‚Äôt fire him because he was a valued member for 20 years.
946,<|emo_surprise|> wow what a steal that was
947,<|emo_surprise|> You got my attention. Good
948,"<|emo_surprise|> That's the only ""recovery"" I'm talking about. You're just throwing away your medical skills for a fake sobriety check..."
950,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, your post history is a real... interesting ride."
951,<|emo_surprise|> i feel surprised and kind of amazed at the same time
952,<|emo_surprise|> This. It gives me life
953,<|emo_surprise|> That was amazing and a year later I still cringe at every part of it
954,<|emo_surprise|> Omg!! They‚Äôre so delicious together! Soiled napkins look amazing to boot
955,<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe the Chargers didn't trade for him
956,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Did not expect the comments to be this vicious.
957,"<|emo_surprise|> Lol, the amount of downvotes you get on your thread? Get used to it."
958,<|emo_surprise|> I think I've had enough of reddit
959,"<|emo_surprise|> This is what I think it is. I'm just an educated guess, but I don't think it's anywhere near as bad as the original. What a shame that others cannot see how terrible the original is."
960,<|emo_surprise|> i would still love them but im reluctant to completely forgive them this time around
961,<|emo_surprise|> Omg is that him?
962,<|emo_surprise|> How is it racist? It's not the only thing he's said about race and hispanics.
963,<|emo_surprise|> No wonder everyone is calling us eliots...
964,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! Just a few months ago these games would have been huge!
965,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Just wow.
966,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that's actually a pretty high bar to clear. I can see some people meeting that low"
968,<|emo_surprise|> i feel very shocked at the news that i m going to have to take away from my job at university next year
969,<|emo_surprise|> Damn this is dope
971,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, now I'm sad"
972,"<|emo_surprise|> This guy was also there for the mass grave, along with his buddy"
973,<|emo_surprise|> i woke up feeling a little stunned
974,<|emo_surprise|> OMG! I didn't know I could use words like that now lol. I'm ecstatic.
975,<|emo_surprise|> I'd be shocked if they don't already have it set up in their NHL account.
976,<|emo_surprise|> I did the same exact thing and ended up crying and then thinking why did you do what you did lol.
977,"<|emo_surprise|> It's just a guess, but I'm about 2/3rd deep on this..."
978,<|emo_surprise|> i feel really shocked but also kinda amused
979,"<|emo_surprise|> Can‚Äôt believe [NAME] actually defeated [NAME]. If you ever want to truly understand why [NAME lost, check out this post]"
981,<|emo_surprise|> W crazy game
982,<|emo_surprise|> This is a weird thing to be concerned about.
983,<|emo_surprise|> I can't imagine [NAME] ever being in a position where he would say that. I wonder what he would say about that.
984,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you sure have blog tastes..."
985,<|emo_surprise|> I don't think he'll be a free agent next offseason either!- How sad.
987,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised the Colts are paying $3.5m for him.
988,<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is why I love Reddit
989,<|emo_surprise|> Wow you‚Äôre so generous with other people‚Äôs money
990,<|emo_surprise|> It's weird to imagine that I could find one of my own.
991,<|emo_surprise|> The worst is when the artist doesn't know what's going on
992,<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is the sexiest thing I've seen all day.
993,<|emo_surprise|> I can‚Äôt see his legs
994,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] yes!
995,"<|emo_surprise|> There went a heck of a while ago now, sorry, we can't do anymore liveblogging :)"
996,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I‚Äôm not surprised he used an escalator his second time.
997,"<|emo_surprise|> The one guy that actually tried, he managed to jump over the top rope..."
998,<|emo_surprise|> It is such a horrifying idea. You should see a doctor if you have any questions.
999,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, where did you get those high heels?"
1000,<|emo_surprise|> It is weird how they can get away with saying this.
1001,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs crazy
1002,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow he actually has a degree in computer science, how'd he get that?"
1003,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôve never seen anything quite like this. I think it‚Äôs absolutely true
1004,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like i have a weird fondness for this thing
1005,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling a little skeptical about this
1006,<|emo_surprise|> i do feel overwhelmed
1007,<|emo_surprise|> I honestly have no idea what this sub‚Äôs about. It‚Äôs weird. I‚Äôd like to talk to someone but...
1008,<|emo_surprise|> Ahhhh. Now I am wondering what the heck happened after I used an old-style rollover as a temporary address.
1009,"<|emo_surprise|> It's the one post you guys are definitelyentioning, what an unfortunate consequence."
1012,<|emo_surprise|> That's a really odd way to spell [NAME].
1014,<|emo_surprise|> Happy Cake day btw!
1015,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I can finally appreciate [NAME].
1016,<|emo_surprise|> OMG he's so handsome!
1017,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] stop
1018,<|emo_surprise|> I'm amazed people buy cars in the states.
1019,<|emo_surprise|> I love this but some grammar mistakes made me cringe.
1020,<|emo_surprise|> What did I just read?!
1022,<|emo_surprise|> Omg that first sentence gave me goosebumps.
1023,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder why he's been shut out. Looked awful in relief of [NAME] too
1024,<|emo_surprise|> Omg what happened
1025,"<|emo_surprise|> My wife is an information technology major. She can't spell [NAME] for me though, because it makes so much sense."
1026,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, did not know [NAME] even existed until I saw this."
1027,<|emo_surprise|> The best is when you feel accepted and loved
1028,"<|emo_surprise|> You‚Äôre not alone... I have been doing this for 20 years, many years, and I‚Äôm over 59 and still not old enough to be a mother. "
1029,<|emo_surprise|> Wow another dude with a gun
1030,<|emo_surprise|> I find it really weird but also very interesting that [NAME] is now an officer and [NAME] is a constable
1031,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, there goes all their confidence"
1032,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my god!
1033,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh look, it's Got a BACKER!"
1034,<|emo_surprise|> oh my gosh yessss
1035,<|emo_surprise|> Wow this.
1036,<|emo_surprise|> So much fake news.
1037,"<|emo_surprise|> That's awesome news! I hope he can hold out at least for the offseason. Wait, is he a forward?"
1038,<|emo_surprise|> > we're scared of the power outage.
1039,<|emo_surprise|> Lol nah. I enjoy reading about different bands trying new things. This is one of my favorites
1040,<|emo_surprise|> i cant believe i woke up so early yesterday morning and found myself in bed with a stranger
1041,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that's wild omg"
1042,<|emo_surprise|> >This is how I made myself cry... with pictures
1043,<|emo_surprise|> Holy hellin heck
1044,<|emo_surprise|> This is why I love reddit.
1045,<|emo_surprise|> That looks like total garbage.
1046,"<|emo_surprise|> omg. the good old ""oh well if you see something you know it's actually a reflection of the person it comes from"""
1047,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you must have typed it out quickly."
1048,<|emo_surprise|> I hope no one is accidentally breathing into my beer when they swallow
1049,<|emo_surprise|> The weird things are gonna be happening inside my head!
1050,<|emo_surprise|> What a bizarre post omg
1051,<|emo_surprise|> i can feel that they know how much the last two movies have impressed me
1052,<|emo_surprise|> No! That‚Äôs my favorite! And now she‚Äôs trying to run away!!!!
1054,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, what a body."
1055,<|emo_surprise|> Haha good point
1056,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I didn't know [NAME] ever said that
1058,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] why did I fall for it
1059,<|emo_surprise|> I had this one tbh. Wasn‚Äôt fond of her.
1060,<|emo_surprise|> The guy who lost his legs in a car accident 5 years ago just had a miracle.
1061,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what his plan is...
1062,<|emo_surprise|> Ah yes my favorite fear
1063,<|emo_surprise|> i do feel surprised that they bothered to record video of me that day
1064,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. Thanks! I should definitely start watching season 7 now.
1065,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, now I am sad"
1066,<|emo_surprise|> That is so amazing. Amazing work!
1067,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME]. It really did not. It was amazing üòé
1068,<|emo_surprise|> oh what a nightmare
1069,<|emo_surprise|> i did not think i would feel this emotional reaction to another song on a album but when i finally did my own music reading i was shocked and stunned
1070,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if OP is [NAME] brother
1071,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, good for her! I‚Äôm sorry that happened for you, but YES! She‚Äôs in much worse shape than you thought she was! üí©"
1072,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if that is because of the way everyone else is treated at work? Also the amount of overtime?
1073,<|emo_surprise|> Who the hell thought he was dead
1074,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. How did [NAME] even finish year? Did it even count?
1075,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder where the stick? And the hat? And the napkin? Thanks.
1076,"<|emo_surprise|> Lol I thought we were in it for the cash prizes, damn it"
1077,<|emo_surprise|> Weird flex but ok
1078,<|emo_surprise|> i guess when a kid is very young that they feel like they arent special
1079,<|emo_surprise|> Wow...
1080,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] that's in my eye!?!?
1081,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how many of them slept with their mom.
1082,<|emo_surprise|> i think i feel more intelligent
1083,<|emo_surprise|> Why hasn't he made an appearance yet
1084,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what that feels like
1086,<|emo_surprise|> Really surprised I had to come this far down to find this!
1087,<|emo_surprise|> Omg this made me chuckle out loud. RIP old me
1088,<|emo_surprise|> That was one heckin heckin bounce
1089,<|emo_surprise|> Wow i thought he was just talking about dating. But you seem to agree.
1090,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, really shocking that one of our MLM's is direct marketing with direct to consumer sales. "
1091,<|emo_surprise|> The amount of snow on the ground in WA state is some of the worst I've ever seen.
1092,<|emo_surprise|> Wow now I know there's a twist. What surprise is this? I'm still surprised by it though. I'm still watching...
1093,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my god. She is!
1094,<|emo_surprise|> What a sweetheart.
1095,<|emo_surprise|> Ah ok! I didn't know about this policy!
1096,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow 6 pack power outage in Gladstone, California at 2 a.m. Central."
1097,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, what a game."
1098,<|emo_surprise|> You should start calling them [NAME].
1099,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised she could read
1100,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is why he didn‚Äôt get that call.
1101,<|emo_surprise|> I thought it was funny that he was angry the whole scene was a load of nonsense omg
1103,"<|emo_surprise|> > but it's worse because its constantly on, why are they mobile always? Because we dont see them every single game day"
1104,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised that [NAME] didn‚Äôt get more cursed
1106,<|emo_surprise|> i feel weird saying it
1107,<|emo_surprise|> I actually thought they were a little bit funny until I saw how big a fan they got.
1108,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a little weird doing that but i m not trying to be all about school work
1109,<|emo_surprise|> You‚Äôre being told you‚Äôre a horrible person for wanting to learn to live with more responsibility. Tell you what...
1110,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling quite impressed
1111,<|emo_surprise|> I was expecting a horrifically broken ankle. You have posted the actually unexpected
1112,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if she thinks about her own anniversary.
1113,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is a dirty player. I don't believe in him.
1114,<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit does this thing really support that much weight
1115,"<|emo_surprise|> This, on top of the already terrible [NAME] report, is actually quite good. What a shame there's still so much to learn about management and football in Turkey. "
1116,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow I'm sorry you had to go through that. I hope you had a good time there and that whatever happened, it didn't turn out bad!"
1118,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I can't believe he actually has a Reddit account.
1119,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm amazed people don‚Äôt have them.
1120,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like you should know about something we did over the years when im younger
1121,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] made the biggest impact on my life and it looks like he's the one who'll be most affected on the court. Stay strong [NAME].
1122,<|emo_surprise|> Oh good lord that's just terrible... You're pretty amazing with understatement
1123,<|emo_surprise|> i really feel quite surprised that i get to comment on books i review at my blog
1124,<|emo_surprise|> I could never go back after I got the 3D printed glasses. They made me think for a moment that I may die
1125,<|emo_surprise|> This is horrible
1126,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow that‚Äôs terrible
1127,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling a little surprised that i didnt see a black person of color at one part of the festival
1128,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh I didn't know about that, do your searching and check the laws in your area!"
1129,<|emo_surprise|> Why is this deleted? Because [NAME] posted it.
1130,<|emo_surprise|> Oh this poor sap
1131,"<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if it's a one off, I've had mine for less than a year and it's still horrible."
1132,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is super scary
1133,<|emo_surprise|> Lol I‚Äôm not surprised you‚Äôre a anti social Mightie/pious christian. Are you an atheist yet?
1134,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, really? I would be amazed if that happened to me!"
1136,<|emo_surprise|> I was wondering if I could get this tbh I really like this game already
1137,<|emo_surprise|> What a game.
1138,<|emo_surprise|> Wow i really can not tell you. It just seems weird.
1139,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh boy, I didn't know we had a special relationship with the internet."
1140,<|emo_surprise|> What does it matter? We'll never take that chance ever again.
1141,<|emo_surprise|> Why would you say that? I completely agree with the first part of that and really don‚Äôt see the other part
1142,<|emo_surprise|> omg theres just someONE Who knows whats been happening with the family tree
1143,"<|emo_surprise|> And now the ""IS THIS WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU ARE AND ARE NOT ONE OF THE PEOPLE"" part comes into play"
1144,"<|emo_surprise|> My first reaction was ""ahhhh damn you're a mean one xD"" but I've since changed my mind"
1145,<|emo_surprise|> I'm honestly amazed they lasted that long. What a miracle.
1146,"<|emo_surprise|> Ah yes, [NAME]!"
1147,"<|emo_surprise|> If we were a culture and allowed the likes of that to happen, we‚Äôd be some screwed up place"
1148,"<|emo_surprise|> My goodness, are there any more?"
1149,<|emo_surprise|> Omg she's gorgeous!
1150,<|emo_surprise|> i just find myself feeling overwhelmed and overwhelmed i wonder if i am being overwhelmed
1151,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, so you admit to being a child molester. Interesting."
1152,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a bit weird not giving out personal statistics
1153,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, you‚Äôre pathetic."
1154,<|emo_surprise|> Yeah no.
1155,<|emo_surprise|> Oh geez that‚Äôs so sad. I hope you‚Äôre doing better now. The good news is she is expected to lose
1156,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is coming to town soon?
1157,<|emo_surprise|> How did I not know about these?
1158,<|emo_surprise|> OMG. The third picture is creepy.
1159,<|emo_surprise|> I saw the full thing with aaaaghhhhhhhhhh he took his shirt off wow
1160,<|emo_surprise|> i got my share but that was only because i was a huge fan and i also got money by paying for it i feel quite amazed
1161,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! No wonder the economy is in shambles.
1162,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you're quite the romantic..."
1163,<|emo_surprise|> Lol actually did. That guy and his lady found the bag they found the chicken and the toothpicks!
1164,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, you guys are strong..."
1165,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how the guy slept.
1166,<|emo_surprise|> I thought I was alone for a moment...
1167,<|emo_surprise|> OMG she's hideous
1168,<|emo_surprise|> i actually feel a little overwhelmed a lot of the time but this summer is just the perfect example i can go back to
1169,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! You are lucky to have survived! I‚Äôm forever grateful.
1170,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I'm so glad I grew up in the middle of it all
1171,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I‚Äôm so very very happy for you
1172,<|emo_surprise|> oh my *god* no
1173,<|emo_surprise|> This is such a weird take.
1174,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh! What an amazing dream come true.
1175,<|emo_surprise|> Wow i have no idea who Orson Welles is but this is good
1176,<|emo_surprise|> I remember seeing this video as a kid. What a miracle!
1177,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] oh geez.
1178,<|emo_surprise|> Well this is frustrating. Who the heck has all these power tools but no hammer
1179,"<|emo_surprise|> This, in my opinion, is the best gif ever. The redhead is definitely in trouble there. "
1180,<|emo_surprise|> Wow what a crazy story.
1181,"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, [NAME] looks rough at times. "
1182,<|emo_surprise|> oh is that it
1183,<|emo_surprise|> Omg yes!!!
1184,<|emo_surprise|> I'm a bit worried since the image and gameplay videos don't seem to be super active.
1185,<|emo_surprise|> My favorite gusgasm
1186,"<|emo_surprise|> Omg, super suprised to not see this already. Was going to add this but then I saw this."
1187,<|emo_surprise|> >The world has changed a ton since [NAME] was alive And her? We're still stuck with her.
1188,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I am so sorry about what happened to your mom. I hope your dad and therapist can talk and figure out what went wrong.
1189,<|emo_surprise|> This has to be my favourite scene from The Goonies
1190,<|emo_surprise|> She is very interesting.
1191,<|emo_surprise|> i do feel very surprised at how little i knew about him after that
1193,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I didn't know that
1194,<|emo_surprise|> im really shocked that the guy feels the need to talk all this crap
1195,<|emo_surprise|> It really is :D
1196,<|emo_surprise|> Oh so you actually got her huh.
1198,<|emo_surprise|> Omg i am watching the next scene and SHOOK I see [NAME] back! Omg!?!
1199,<|emo_surprise|> Really? I thought there was a lot of excitement. I'm very happy I never got to see that.
1200,<|emo_surprise|> My surprise they surprised the dog.
1201,<|emo_surprise|> This is what makes this super creepy and great
1202,<|emo_surprise|> Omg isnt that the god awful truth
1203,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, she really is quite the romantic"
1204,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. Just by watching this, I am pretty convinced that reddit hates [NAME]."
1205,<|emo_surprise|> This is why I love Reddit.
1206,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh no, my bad"
1207,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that‚Äôs so amazing!
1209,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is so much more terrifying in person than he is on camera.
1210,<|emo_surprise|> My blood pressure Edit: Oh good lord it's got me a surprise on my doorstep...
1211,<|emo_surprise|> Happy cake day!!
1212,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. How did you all not notice this?
1213,<|emo_surprise|> i also have a feeling that hes feeling a little hesitant in his decision
1214,<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs honestly surprising there isn‚Äôt more media attention paid to this
1216,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you folks sure are salty about the state of affairs in the north east."
1217,<|emo_surprise|> Yeah that's right. It was the best song by [NAME]
1218,<|emo_surprise|> Really?! I thought I was the only one!
1219,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] that's so wonderful...
1220,<|emo_surprise|> Thanks for sharing! The photos are gorgeous!
1221,<|emo_surprise|> i still feel stunned
1222,<|emo_surprise|> Why even watch that channel? I‚Äôve been to multiple cities now and I don‚Äôt see that any more!
1223,<|emo_surprise|> Damn I hope so.
1224,<|emo_surprise|> This made me very happy.
1225,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow that's a burden, I'm sorry."
1226,<|emo_surprise|> What if [NAME] is not a natural born speaker? I'd be surprised if he speaks that native tongue
1227,"<|emo_surprise|> If she can't pass the smell test, I'm surprised she can pass basic English."
1228,"<|emo_surprise|> What's it called? ""TheATER""? Its a weird name"
1229,"<|emo_surprise|> This is amazing, I love Reddit."
1230,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I'm a bigosed lass just watching this
1231,<|emo_surprise|> Ouch. I think the video is shaky
1232,"<|emo_surprise|> >or they just don't care, or why do you say ""it's hard to imagine what [NAME] might have accomplished"" It's hard to imagine what she could have accomplished."
1233,"<|emo_surprise|> And if she doesn't, they are obligated to give her a new one! The problem is, [NAME] doesn't want them to."
1234,<|emo_surprise|> i can remember feeling amazed every time i saw an image that made me remember all the awesome things i know the other girls do
1235,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you‚Äôre disgusting"
1236,<|emo_surprise|> oh [NAME] how awful!
1237,<|emo_surprise|> What a steal that is
1240,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow that‚Äôs...seriously.
1241,<|emo_surprise|> There went a long time into the video. I‚Äôm really going to miss that.
1243,<|emo_surprise|> Lol!!
1244,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you must smarten up a lot in 6 months!"
1245,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that sucks good luck"
1246,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised this isn't a thing yet tbh.
1247,<|emo_surprise|> So that's why the military is called the armed services now.
1249,<|emo_surprise|> The face
1250,<|emo_surprise|> Wow what a find. I used to be able to shop at it but have since gotten rid of it.
1251,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I totally forgot about that.
1252,<|emo_surprise|> i feel really amazed that they have come this far
1253,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] and I‚Äôd say [NAME] is a madman.
1254,<|emo_surprise|> It's like a three year old saying ‚ÄúI love you and you are a monster!!‚Äù
1255,<|emo_surprise|> There you go. They really do go around town. You just need a witness to something or people to record it.
1256,<|emo_surprise|> Omg that full House look. So season 1 worth it though.
1257,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh geez this is why I'm surprised Reddit doesn't have an option for ""since Januari 18"""
1258,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like a strangeo person in his own way and then a very smart one
1259,<|emo_surprise|> Wow what a weird situation. I‚Äôd be surprised to learn that the man is his brother.
1260,<|emo_surprise|> The irony is you are telling the truth but he doesn't believe it
1262,<|emo_surprise|> Who needs all that free stuff when you can enjoy it for free?
1263,<|emo_surprise|> My heart melted omg [NAME]
1264,<|emo_surprise|> Oh heck oh heck
1265,<|emo_surprise|> You seem really eager. Maybe the show makes you question everything you thought you knew about life? Maybe you are just really curious now and need to go into that knowing yourself better
1266,<|emo_surprise|> Weird how just about everything on this reddit is pro-Donald
1268,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, the top comments are almost all telling of how he's a racist and that this is a good thing."
1269,<|emo_surprise|> i feel pretty amazed that this would fly though
1270,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm so worried, but it looks really real :D"
1271,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what that feels like.
1272,<|emo_surprise|> What a crazy person she is.
1274,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, now I wonder what [NAME] would have sounded like if we had him"
1275,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow that‚Äôs a burden, I‚Äôm very sorry for your loss!"
1276,<|emo_surprise|> She lost? Wow hold my wine.
1277,<|emo_surprise|> I'd be amazed if he knew much about politics.
1278,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I thought it was funny how they used [NAME] as a franchise...
1279,<|emo_surprise|> I thought I must be imagining all this but no
1280,<|emo_surprise|> The real horror!
1282,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you had me at ""oh good lord this is awful"""
1283,<|emo_surprise|> You just posted the same thing to other subs though.
1285,"<|emo_surprise|> So, you're a woman who's had a history of dangerous driving?"
1286,<|emo_surprise|> i would be so impressed to find a guy like you that can hold it together on your own
1287,<|emo_surprise|> This is so cool. I'm a virgin with a and a wife...and I'm 34....so the idea of not wanting to date someone before 30 is new to me.
1289,"<|emo_surprise|> And yet, somehow all of this happened 9 months ago, and most people do have a month to get used to it."
1290,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I didn't know there was another appreciation thread...
1291,<|emo_surprise|> oh i didn‚Äôt expect that
1292,<|emo_surprise|> That's why I love Reddit.
1293,"<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs just a video? Not that [NAME] is a stranger, right?"
1294,<|emo_surprise|> What I don't seem to understand is you still want your idealized version?
1295,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh no, my heart!"
1296,<|emo_surprise|> i started to feel a little overwhelmed and then i thought about how i could still write but not in the same way and it made me feel amazing
1297,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is a nasty bimbo.
1298,<|emo_surprise|> What an absolutely amazing story. I cannot begin to imagine the shock and utter horror he must have felt hearing that so many people actually believe this!
1299,"<|emo_surprise|> I've tried. No luck. So, what are you talking about?"
1300,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! In the world of Netflix there's more [NAME] content than [NAME]!
1301,<|emo_surprise|> > Wow I‚Äôve never cringed so hard
1302,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling really quite overwhelmed
1304,<|emo_surprise|> > We live in a strange time We live in a strange time Oh damn
1305,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if they even have any female directors.
1307,"<|emo_surprise|> I was surprised when they were short, but [NAME] can shoot"
1309,<|emo_surprise|> i have been feeling quite overwhelmed for some reason and some of my family still stay with me
1310,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. I really did not know about this. Thanks for sharing. I know I speak for myself but for the record I don‚Äôt think being ugly is attractive either.
1311,<|emo_surprise|> Oh sh*t I‚Äôm on fire
1312,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME]. What happened?
1313,<|emo_surprise|> She can't even do this LOL what a joke
1314,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, I didn‚Äôt know that! I always thought ‚Ä∞we just need to talk about [NAME]‚Äù and didn‚Äôt know they had a different opinion."
1315,<|emo_surprise|> Omg [NAME] I want to die
1316,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling slightly overwhelmed and want to go back to this blog
1317,<|emo_surprise|> i like to be surprised when i feel something i m sure will be OK
1318,<|emo_surprise|> i mean i feel a bit weird
1319,<|emo_surprise|> Ah no the death of capitalism!
1320,<|emo_surprise|> Ohh! Looks like we have a new sub reddit for [NAME]! Please follow!
1321,<|emo_surprise|> omg yes!
1322,<|emo_surprise|> i still feel very shocked and disturbed that a child could be this disrespectful
1323,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a little surprised at how little time i get to post comments or any sort of review
1324,<|emo_surprise|> Oh no her eyebrows
1327,<|emo_surprise|> Oh god I don‚Äôt get [NAME] :( he‚Äôs just one of the best Atlesters I've ever seen
1328,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a little overwhelmed and a little foolish
1329,<|emo_surprise|> This is the most exact copy that I've seen (I've only watched a few dozen). I like it.
1330,<|emo_surprise|> Wow she's horrible
1331,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like i was caught in a strange time vortex
1332,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I‚Äôm sorry we had an interesting debate on here.
1333,<|emo_surprise|> i was feeling overwhelmed with the task that i was laying in front of me
1334,<|emo_surprise|> Omg she reminds me of Ginger from Ginger Snaps! She and Ginger Snaps pretty similar in a way and I love them both but Ginger just has that pop factor.
1335,"<|emo_surprise|> He will get better, and I will love him as he gets better."
1336,"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah, you know that story. (The Netflix documentary about [NAME] is really good, too.)"
1337,<|emo_surprise|> If he gets in a fighting style with [NAME] then I‚Äôm not surprised.
1339,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow that's just a huge stretch then. ""Selling cookies to old people and young people"" sure sounds like she's making some assumptions. "
1341,<|emo_surprise|> That sounds awful. Is the show still on?
1342,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you seem nice"
1343,"<|emo_surprise|> Lol, she has a point there."
1344,<|emo_surprise|> You're right!! I'm so glad I grew up in the US.
1345,<|emo_surprise|> This is amazing how did you get hold of a camera like this
1346,<|emo_surprise|> i know this is a joke in r/funny but i think of the amount of men who feel the need to tell stories of great accomplishment or accomplishment not too shabbily
1347,<|emo_surprise|> Happy cake day u/snerk
1349,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling a little less overwhelmed than i was in midterms
1350,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME], I don't know where you are, but I got news for you!"
1352,<|emo_surprise|> Oh for fuck‚Äôs sake [NAME]
1353,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, the amount of hate people have expressed toward this photo in the past... Wow."
1354,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, I didn't know this existed until I saw this"
1355,"<|emo_surprise|> She had such a clear plan, now she's just screwing around & blowing draftks. "
1356,<|emo_surprise|> I'm so glad you have bots cause otherwise people who are so stupid would just take bot to reddit and abuse.
1357,<|emo_surprise|> No! That's horrible news!..for Galaxy fans lol
1358,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I really can't believe these are real"
1359,<|emo_surprise|> No way [NAME] has 9 points in 10 games against Detroit...
1360,"<|emo_surprise|> I can only assume that the cops knew about this, because they searched all of his homes and arrested all of his family members."
1361,<|emo_surprise|> Soooo...yikes.
1362,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling amazed he told i hope we make this together
1363,<|emo_surprise|> i could have guessed the problem was amp amp g cant have come across someone like him
1364,<|emo_surprise|> i didnt feel brave but im not going to lie i actually feel kind of silly
1365,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] this is how someone who is supposed to be supporting the middle class sneezed on the floor.
1366,<|emo_surprise|> Is that even a fucking shirt? I can't even wear shorts in summer.
1367,"<|emo_surprise|> So, you're a [NAME] who is terrified of [NAME]?"
1368,<|emo_surprise|> Oh look a body double!
1369,"<|emo_surprise|> > Wow, I didn't know people in this sub were as shocked that [NAME] would call himself [NAME] as [NAME]."
1370,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised he didn't say, ""I swear these are my porn stars from porn sites now you're gonna see [NAME]"". "
1371,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm so sorry human being üòÇ the world is an amazing place and you‚Äôre the only one who experiences pain üò¢ i hate it.
1372,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, she may be able to give birth naturally. "
1373,<|emo_surprise|> The only thing that surprised me was how many people didn't pick [NAME].
1374,<|emo_surprise|> oh my [NAME] i thought I was the only one! thank you so much for these comments btw
1375,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I‚Äôm watching two of my favorite teams and it happens...
1376,<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit she's amazing
1377,<|emo_surprise|> oh man that's a bummer and we didn't have that???
1378,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that‚Äôs a good-looking man
1379,<|emo_surprise|> I was shocked when I saw his YouTube channel.
1380,<|emo_surprise|> i can't really explain it without hurting to read it
1381,<|emo_surprise|> The weirdest thing is how it never went into overdrive. He wanted to see if he could get it done before the meet. Hope he could
1382,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that‚Äôs awful. I‚Äôm so sorry for your friend. Wow. You did great.
1383,<|emo_surprise|> i feel surprised she will choose my name he says
1384,"<|emo_surprise|> Can you add a few MORE pictures? Is that ok with you? If so, good luck! :) Also, do you have a link to find the original? Thanks much ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1385,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I wish I could get that lucky, my sister would be so proud!"
1386,<|emo_surprise|> im starting to feel wistful just thinking about it
1387,<|emo_surprise|> Who was surprised by that? Seems fair.
1388,<|emo_surprise|> What a weird question...
1389,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling so overwhelmed by it all
1390,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] no.
1391,"<|emo_surprise|> Lol, now I am sad"
1392,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs one of the few times I‚Äôve ever gone against [NAME] in a match. The other was the LOD against Numbani which was close.
1393,<|emo_surprise|> The internet never disappoints. It's been funny this week as well if you can call it that.
1394,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME]!
1395,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, I was surprised too"
1396,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that was fucking creepy
1397,<|emo_surprise|> That is a lot of kcals missing
1398,<|emo_surprise|> Oh. That‚Äôs what I thought.
1399,<|emo_surprise|> Wow he had actually managed to get 6 shots!!! You get a lot more experience with them?
1400,<|emo_surprise|> It seems weird to me that he has the audacity to call himself a pop star.
1401,<|emo_surprise|> That video is freaking awesome lol
1402,"<|emo_surprise|> If my house had a sink, I'd probably be bathroom sharing almost nothing."
1403,<|emo_surprise|> What a nasty surprise.
1404,<|emo_surprise|> They‚Äôre talking 2nd line center and 1st line center....
1405,"<|emo_surprise|> > It‚Äôs worth mentioning, that this is where I‚Äôm from, which really shocks me."
1406,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME]. I didn't know I could be so dumb.
1407,<|emo_surprise|> oh [NAME] this is horrible
1408,<|emo_surprise|> *aggressively tells friend I love them*
1409,<|emo_surprise|> That sounds wonderful!
1410,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised they're admitting the same thing. Even worse is saying, ""it just depends how we use it"""
1411,<|emo_surprise|> What a time to be alive!
1412,<|emo_surprise|> i was feeling overwhelmed by it all and wanted something to help me deal
1413,<|emo_surprise|> I can't imagine being this retired
1414,<|emo_surprise|> i feel amazed on how far the police has come in the last few months
1415,<|emo_surprise|> Oh that‚Äôs awesome! I didn‚Äôt know my dad didn‚Äôt use it so I was surprised to hear he did!
1416,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I've never seen a more adorable kitty
1417,<|emo_surprise|> OMG I thought he said [NAME] as [NAME]
1418,<|emo_surprise|> i hope there is way more to this story and i feel really stupid for getting so excited about such a ridiculous thing as a fan club
1419,<|emo_surprise|> i don t know why and what makes me feel so overwhelmed that i want to cry
1420,<|emo_surprise|> Lmao can‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs a mod some days.
1421,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I didn't know [NAME] was a journalist
1423,<|emo_surprise|> This is my favorite!
1424,"<|emo_surprise|> I read that as ""paid"" labor not sex slavery. I don't agree with that statement at all."
1425,<|emo_surprise|> Oh for sure! One of the first things we did after she became an officer was a carpool with the officer as we were getting ready to go for a walk!
1426,<|emo_surprise|> The best part of this is that they're all surprised that you've ever done Reddit.
1427,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling very surprised that no one had enough of me screaming at them and screaming out what a horrible day it was for you
1428,"<|emo_surprise|> The ""it's just a game"" and the guy who hands him the duff jacket says it was a joke."
1429,<|emo_surprise|> The fuck? Wow.
1430,<|emo_surprise|> i feel very helpless in the face of those
1431,<|emo_surprise|> What an eyesore.
1432,"<|emo_surprise|> I always wondered why they called it a ""box."""
1433,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Your sisters are crazy.
1434,<|emo_surprise|> No. Please elaborate on that story. Ive only recently discovered it.
1435,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs an extremely early warning sign you‚Äôm having an anxiety or depression episode.... take time out of your day or weekend to do something like that!
1436,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I didn't know [NAME] was a [NAME]"
1437,<|emo_surprise|> i feel strange lately
1438,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, he's actually in the wrong doctor's office."
1439,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you're lucky I myself. That's...a lesson I didn't learn on my journey. "
1440,<|emo_surprise|> *Poop hole* Oooohwee!
1441,<|emo_surprise|> He was there when I met him and honoured his memory. I can see him now!
1442,<|emo_surprise|> I have no idea what your post means. But I think it points to a bigger problem with how we view marriage.
1443,<|emo_surprise|> I've missed this.
1444,"<|emo_surprise|> Well, that would be illegal and that could get you fired."
1445,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a tinge of the surprised
1447,<|emo_surprise|> What an amazing journey. So many interesting people along the way. I am truly eternally grateful.
1448,<|emo_surprise|> > Oh my Googles are empty Oh my Googles are empty
1449,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. He looks like the lead singer of teen idol group idol.
1450,<|emo_surprise|> I'm not shocked by [NAME] finding consistency. Haha
1451,<|emo_surprise|> Wtf is a weeb
1452,"<|emo_surprise|> She said I was a ""bogus"" and she wanted to divorce me."
1453,<|emo_surprise|> Thats beyond fucking creepy. You are making me paranoid you know it didnt just happen
1454,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a little overwhelmed
1455,<|emo_surprise|> You've had experience of being insulted at work...
1456,"<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs actually surprising the government made it so simple to use, but yeah... still a good tip. OP needs better pics though. "
1457,<|emo_surprise|> Well this is the first one I‚Äôve seen where people actually think he‚Äôs intelligent
1458,<|emo_surprise|> i was feeling really curious about her story and this made me feel even more curious i will continue to post about her story
1459,<|emo_surprise|> I was a little surprised that it had as many up votes as it did tbh
1460,"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, that's cool!"
1461,<|emo_surprise|> Ah damn it! My entire life‚Äôs been a lie
1462,<|emo_surprise|> i hope you can make up your mind if you did then either way im glad i went to college and read this way if for no other reason but the idea of sharing what was for me one of my strong points in college was this and feeling impressed that i truly could appreciate the stories you had to tell
1463,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, there's still room for improvement though! "
1464,<|emo_surprise|> omg I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre a [NAME] fan
1465,<|emo_surprise|> i can remember feeling shocked and then glad
1466,<|emo_surprise|> OMG! I didn't know she had a kid with him! She just says they started dating last week!
1467,<|emo_surprise|> i have come out and said to him he could have said so but i am feeling a little stunned
1468,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that‚Äôs just crazy.
1469,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow you‚Äôre so generous with other people‚Äôs money you crazy shill
1470,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that was truly disgusting"
1471,<|emo_surprise|> Omg I love it
1472,<|emo_surprise|> I can‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs real
1474,<|emo_surprise|> I can‚Äôt imagine thinking that hard for that. It‚Äôs beyond horrifying. Thank you so much.
1476,<|emo_surprise|> Omg. I would die. That show is amazing.
1477,<|emo_surprise|> And I thought you were anastrophic
1478,<|emo_surprise|> Omg why did I think of this
1479,<|emo_surprise|> i have a deep yet sometimes uncertain feeling about everything
1480,<|emo_surprise|> i feel curious about all the animals and plants around me and wonder what its like when your eyes travel great distances
1481,<|emo_surprise|> No! I‚Äôm shitting myself! üòÇ
1482,<|emo_surprise|> What a sweetheart! I'm glad she's safe and reunited with her kids.
1483,<|emo_surprise|> Oh that‚Äôs just one of the many terrible things that can be said about this sub
1484,<|emo_surprise|> You're not alone...
1485,<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is the first time I‚Äôve ever heard of this. What a wild ride. Thanks for sharing
1486,<|emo_surprise|> i feel this is a really wonderful piece of kit
1487,<|emo_surprise|> i feel more truthful about the things that have bothered me about my blog lately
1488,<|emo_surprise|> No wonder anyone has done anything remotely funny or original in the last month.
1489,"<|emo_surprise|> Holy crap that really is an awful list, I think you missed some pretty good players!"
1490,<|emo_surprise|> He‚Äôs not a top 10 list of most improved NHLers though.
1491,<|emo_surprise|> Omg! I can‚Äôt believe you defeated him. What a high ground achievement! ü§£
1492,<|emo_surprise|> I have a deep seeded hatred for close-minded people too.
1494,<|emo_surprise|> Oh that poor sap
1495,<|emo_surprise|> I've always wondered how people could be so cruel!
1496,<|emo_surprise|> Oh good lord what did I do
1497,"<|emo_surprise|> A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one."
1498,<|emo_surprise|> i feel very strange inside
1499,<|emo_surprise|> i feel amazed and surprised that a person in my own country has that thought
1500,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, I saw something about that - thank you!"
1501,<|emo_surprise|> That was what scared me the most about that.
1502,<|emo_surprise|> What a journey.
1503,<|emo_surprise|> The biggest Nightmare
1504,<|emo_surprise|> It wasn't weird to think about having sex with someone's penis while they're on fire. Is it weird to think about having sex with someone's penis while they're on fire?
1507,<|emo_surprise|> Hey! [NAME] is at the game! I heard he's a pretty alright defender! I'm just really not sold on his floor tonight.
1508,<|emo_surprise|> Wow it might be accurate
1509,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, I thought you said it was 40c"
1510,<|emo_surprise|> i feel more surprised than anything
1511,<|emo_surprise|> i dont quite understand how she could possibly be angry and upset on top of feeling so tender and caring for her?
1512,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] this is horrible
1513,"<|emo_surprise|> I think he lost it somewhere along the line somewhere along the line, and I think this is his story."
1514,<|emo_surprise|> i was at the bus stop and the guy that passed by walked by as fast as i did he had a very impressed look on his face and this made me feel a little bit dazed
1515,<|emo_surprise|> ohhhhh my gosh it‚Äôs happening again
1516,<|emo_surprise|> Waaame! That game was the best game I‚Äôve been to.
1517,<|emo_surprise|> How many of us do you have? I've always found them to be extremely sympathetic.
1518,<|emo_surprise|> The way she always talks in those weird YT vids and her weird Reddit history is like wtf.
1519,<|emo_surprise|> This is literally me!
1520,"<|emo_surprise|> Lol I thought everyone was saying it was a new type of shard? Like, [NAME]"
1521,<|emo_surprise|> Thanks. I don't know how anyone could come away with that idea
1522,<|emo_surprise|> I am just happy this wasn't much of a thing back when we won the cup.
1524,<|emo_surprise|> How do you not laugh?
1525,<|emo_surprise|> Omg! But I just had a panic attack OMG I can't do it!
1526,<|emo_surprise|> Wow your age difference is insane I‚Äôd be surprised if you were that old by your current date of birth.
1527,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! The degree is in natural history. Not computer science. How did I not know this
1528,<|emo_surprise|> You seem fun
1529,<|emo_surprise|> I can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre giving him a $550k buyout for the rest of his life...
1530,<|emo_surprise|> i feel really curious about the other children
1531,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised we didn‚Äôt get to see a screaming [NAME].
1532,<|emo_surprise|> I'm shocked by how many people don't support Arizona going for [NAME].
1533,<|emo_surprise|> Lol this is amazing. Tried doing that once and it was an absolute blast
1534,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that's an adventure!"
1536,<|emo_surprise|> OMG she's gorgeous!
1537,<|emo_surprise|> I'm more surprised that they're showering people in the park.
1538,<|emo_surprise|> i feel very surprised and impressed to know that i meet such a person
1539,<|emo_surprise|> Thanks I hate it.
1540,<|emo_surprise|> Oh shitttt.
1541,<|emo_surprise|> Omg I was there yesterday! The view of Allianz field was truly amazing.
1542,"<|emo_surprise|> A surprise turn of events! I've always been a huge fan of her work, and this is a really good sign!"
1543,<|emo_surprise|> i have been feeling a bit overwhelmed with everything that is happening around me lately
1544,<|emo_surprise|> i feel pretty stunned with the news this week but i will get over this next week
1545,<|emo_surprise|> That's so awesome to know. You went out of your way to find this out so people can't be all judgey and say I deserve all the blame
1546,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, thank you!"
1547,<|emo_surprise|> I had a stroke reading these
1548,"<|emo_surprise|> What? I‚Äôm new here, thanks for the correction. I‚Äôm not so sure he would have said that."
1549,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that‚Äôs an entirely new level of stupidity and lack of foresight for her to believe that this was a wise use of funds.
1550,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, you‚Äôre quite the romantic..."
1551,"<|emo_surprise|> Omg, yesssssssh!"
1553,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I'm sorry but does anyone have YouTube?"
1554,"<|emo_surprise|> He's 30, damn it"
1555,<|emo_surprise|> I just came home and my wife told me she hates me
1556,<|emo_surprise|> How did I not notice this?
1557,"<|emo_surprise|> Ah yes, the infamous tucker barreled video. Truly the scariest thing he did all together."
1558,"<|emo_surprise|> Is it weird that I keep longing for a ‚Äútoned men‚Äù? I mean, toned men can definitely do that"
1559,<|emo_surprise|> Well I think that was a pretty poor take on what [NAME] said.
1560,<|emo_surprise|> *Poop hole* Owwww I'd gooooood for that!
1561,<|emo_surprise|> OMG the bra hanging out of the back of the dress is so cringe. I‚Äôd never even thought of that.
1562,"<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs not just me who feels that way, I‚Äôm literally shaking and crying right now."
1563,<|emo_surprise|> i feel so amazed
1564,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG dad, I thought about this...my heart!"
1565,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I saw something similar with 3D printed clothes. What a strange idea.
1566,<|emo_surprise|> Omg. I'm so sorry.
1567,<|emo_surprise|> You're so right! Thank you for the info. I appreciate your input! Thank you for being so calm. I'm so glad things looked out of my control
1568,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, how I miss the north hills bottom dollar when it comes to beer."
1570,<|emo_surprise|> i feel overwhelmed but believe us
1571,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] that's so sad. And she is a very accomplished chore artist.
1572,<|emo_surprise|> Wow... That's a lot of calories
1573,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised he didn't ask for a picture with the bride-to-be though.
1574,"<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised it held so many players, maybe they did something to cause it to happen more often?"
1575,<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is the first time I‚Äôve seen this... interesting.
1576,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, what a find."
1578,<|emo_surprise|> Oh man another year
1579,<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is more cringe than anything.
1580,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if the deer eyes are that black. Look closer and you'll see it isn't.
1581,<|emo_surprise|> > [NAME] gets more minutes but he's worse on defense than [NAME] ever was.
1582,<|emo_surprise|> Omg. You are blessed. ‚ù§Ô∏è
1583,<|emo_surprise|> There can be an entire team of 6 who play same role but get a lot more responsibility lol. Good play
1584,"<|emo_surprise|> Ohhhhhhh, they are so delicious. "
1585,<|emo_surprise|> omg the face
1586,<|emo_surprise|> There's no limit on the number of characters allowed in a username...it's just a matter of taste though.
1587,<|emo_surprise|> i have a feeling it will be good when my parents do
1588,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh no, my [NAME] "
1589,<|emo_surprise|> Yikes. That sounds horrible. Good luck!
1591,<|emo_surprise|> Oh gosh. I didn't know there was a button for this. Thanks for sharing!
1592,<|emo_surprise|> The fuck out of that shit pool
1593,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, I thought was a thing?! ü§Æ"
1594,<|emo_surprise|> i remember feeling something just as weird
1595,<|emo_surprise|> That was amazing.
1596,<|emo_surprise|> Omg I'm crying rn [NAME] I was so excited to see him. But then I saw the injury he sustained
1597,<|emo_surprise|> Wow what kind of support is this getting?
1598,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised they didn't say ""to the left of normalcy""."
1599,<|emo_surprise|> I watched the show for a week and didn't realize he did this...
1600,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you‚Äôre quite the romantic..."
1601,<|emo_surprise|> The fact that she thinks 3am is a date is astounding.
1602,<|emo_surprise|> >he was in his early 20's but still looks young enough to be me. Never older than 30
1603,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I‚Äôm a terrible reader]
1604,<|emo_surprise|> Thanks. Wasn't too happy to see that but you seem pretty cool.
1605,"<|emo_surprise|> i don t feel more shocked, than i did at the fact it made me feel like a new woman"
1606,<|emo_surprise|> What a sweetheart!
1607,"<|emo_surprise|> This is one of my favorite takes on the whole sub reddit, btw. I love it."
1608,<|emo_surprise|> i went to bed feeling pretty impressed even though i was skeptical of things
1609,<|emo_surprise|> Is that really fucking real
1610,<|emo_surprise|> It was literally the tip of his tongue....
1611,<|emo_surprise|> i feel surprised that someone dares to call me a dirty n***
1612,<|emo_surprise|> I find it kinda weird that half the posts on /r/bchare are about the other half..
1613,"<|emo_surprise|> If this is true, and I'm still surprised it's not, then why it's getting such press."
1614,<|emo_surprise|> He absolutely does.
1615,<|emo_surprise|> i remember feeling surprised a lot by how little i thought of it
1616,<|emo_surprise|> wow i would have thought they were going to be a little more conservative with her but c'mon lakers
1617,<|emo_surprise|> I've never read a more disgusted and condescending review of the novel by a single person.
1618,<|emo_surprise|> I would be surprised if she is. I know a couple of moms who have had their twins. They are really into each other. No matter where it is.
1620,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôd be surprised if she voted for him since it‚Äôs all so familiar
1621,<|emo_surprise|> I had no idea they were vegan. I'm surprised more people didn't catch on.
1622,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what would happen if we did that
1623,<|emo_surprise|> I watched that video twice. Weirded out and discouraged
1624,"<|emo_surprise|> You better be, because otherwise, we're taking away away your freedom."
1625,<|emo_surprise|> It does sounds like a terrible thing to do... But I haven't done it myself either... So I m wondering if this is the only way to do it.
1626,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my god what happened?? I‚Äôm on my phone! What did I do?!
1627,<|emo_surprise|> i feel surprised that a few days ago we didnt hear something like that
1628,<|emo_surprise|> He must really love the drama around him
1630,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is the most underrated [NAME]. I always play him with [NAME] and I‚Äôm amazed at how much I like him
1631,<|emo_surprise|> i must admit in that game of basketball my hands were shaking the whole entire game
1632,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow just wow. He had one hand on the handle, but he was never likely to lose control or trip."
1633,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I'm so sorry about your great friend
1634,<|emo_surprise|> They made one from scratch that had a 4D printed plastic jaw. Feels like an improvement.
1636,<|emo_surprise|> Oh really? I thought that you said you were from the south saskatchewan area?
1637,"<|emo_surprise|> Omg what if [NAME] actually said this to [NAME] before the ump, ugh. Wtf."
1638,"<|emo_surprise|> Just got it, thanks for the report! "
1639,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. This is the most generous I've ever seen someone be.
1640,<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs so weird
1643,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh!
1644,<|emo_surprise|> It's only 5 minutes long? Wow I don't swallow toothpaste idiot
1646,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm wondering if the police are being more pushy on him.
1648,<|emo_surprise|> i remember feeling very surprised when i found out that the only things that jill had on her bed were two pillows and a duvet
1649,<|emo_surprise|> The thing I'm most excited for is her unlikely connection to [NAME]
1650,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what his schedule looks like this season.
1651,<|emo_surprise|> That was a game-changer.
1652,<|emo_surprise|> Damn it. I'm sorry.
1653,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh, I read this entire back issue and was like holy shit, how did I miss this? Wow, great write up dude. "
1654,<|emo_surprise|> I'm just amazed that you were able to tell that with your face.
1655,<|emo_surprise|> Who a surprise...
1656,"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah, it's because I was young enough in the season to not remember it. "
1657,<|emo_surprise|> I'm not a [NAME] fan but this was the best reaction I've seen so far this season.
1658,<|emo_surprise|> Wow.. what happens when you give a teenager advice on how to avoid a sexual predator. He/she instead of helping you avoid their evil behavior. What a strange thing to say
1659,<|emo_surprise|> If by this it means that your father is a porn addict you'll be surprised how much I've changed my mind.
1661,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like everyone got really overwhelmed and rushed through about something like that
1662,<|emo_surprise|> Who here speaks fluent Ukrainian?
1663,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I didn't even know this. Thanks for the update bro
1664,<|emo_surprise|> What a day! What a wonderful day! This is the kind of story I'd have told had I been born yesterday.
1667,<|emo_surprise|> i feel really strange not being able to enjoy my days outside of school
1668,<|emo_surprise|> Oh man. Stay warm.
1669,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! Never thought of that! I hope this is true
1670,<|emo_surprise|> That guy seems genuinely surprised to have found this. I think I've just seen the beginning of disillusionment.
1671,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I had no idea [NAME] even exists. Got to check that out.
1672,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised they're letting this sub have a sub anymore haha
1673,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, what a nightmare."
1674,<|emo_surprise|> Wow it looks like we've gone two years without a title dramatic or shocking twist.
1675,<|emo_surprise|> Well this is a little surprising tbh tbh.
1676,<|emo_surprise|> im so damn excited and relieved
1677,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh- what a save!
1678,<|emo_surprise|> oh [NAME] is that ya
1679,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] has gotta be the same person who thinks he can jump out of a fucking window
1680,<|emo_surprise|> Yikes. What a weird thing to say.
1681,<|emo_surprise|> Lol you just outed your crush on [NAME]?!
1682,"<|emo_surprise|> oh, it worked"
1683,<|emo_surprise|> oh i've never seen nor heard of this either before
1686,<|emo_surprise|> What a gift.
1687,<|emo_surprise|> You're so right! My life is complete
1688,"<|emo_surprise|> I don't know how any of this is possible, but wow I'm glad you're on your way out. "
1689,<|emo_surprise|> Well the guy that was talking about taking the child away said how worried he was the child would actually become violent.
1690,<|emo_surprise|> i would feel like a strange one
1691,<|emo_surprise|> i can think of is how after years when i left the university i came back feeling very amazed to find all my relationships with friends had changed from good friends to friends who looked and were an awful lot older
1692,<|emo_surprise|> You're welcome! Happy new year and year to you as well!
1693,<|emo_surprise|> omg yes!!
1694,<|emo_surprise|> And [NAME] was a BEAST.
1695,"<|emo_surprise|> Lmao no wonder people think he's so ""cute"" lol"
1696,<|emo_surprise|> Really?
1697,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, is that true? I‚Äôve spoken to many players who told me they found it weird how it just took over first after the stun etc."
1698,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised they're surprised that the building they're demolishing isn't a hotel
1699,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, what is with all the downvotes?"
1700,<|emo_surprise|> Weird flex I know
1701,<|emo_surprise|> The only [NAME] joke so far was him not getting a hug lol
1702,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] looks so damn surprised and disappointed. O-O does him ever?!
1703,<|emo_surprise|> Thanks I was wondering how I should start it.
1704,"<|emo_surprise|> Ouch, now I‚Äôm crying"
1705,"<|emo_surprise|> He was great, but I think the real gem is watching him backpedal as he was corrected."
1706,<|emo_surprise|> That is an amazing living room.
1707,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I wish I could say that but I‚Äôm sorry dude
1708,<|emo_surprise|> I am at a loss for words for words... Wow you're absolutely right!
1710,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I never knew you could do that"
1711,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! Noted!
1712,<|emo_surprise|> i thought about it the other day and didn t feel impressed that there is any other way to have the same feeling but i didn t feel impressed at all
1713,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling amazed right now
1714,<|emo_surprise|> i feel weird saying it because i feel how i sound to people
1715,<|emo_surprise|> OMG is that a little goat?! ü§£ ü§´
1716,<|emo_surprise|> i mean honestly i wish i knew everything that everyone had said about the show before it came out but even back then i was surprised by how big an effect it had on me as i always liked it to be a little girl
1717,<|emo_surprise|> Oh geez. I'm so sorry for your loss lol. Best wishes to you and your family.
1718,<|emo_surprise|> What in the actual fuck? That was amazing. What a steal that was
1721,<|emo_surprise|> i feel really amazed and grateful
1722,<|emo_surprise|> How is it racist? I'm sorry you feel this way.
1723,<|emo_surprise|> I can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre talking about [NAME]. Is he seriously that good?
1725,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] this poor sap
1726,<|emo_surprise|> OMG I like theÔøΩÔøΩ Apple Music store
1728,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I wasnt expecting that
1729,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I hope they fix the zoomed out sun right after the shot.
1730,<|emo_surprise|> What a time to be alive
1731,<|emo_surprise|> She looked really hot in those shots.
1732,<|emo_surprise|> I think my boyfriend and I have one of those. It's so sweet!
1733,"<|emo_surprise|> That's such a selfish mentality to have, to think you deserve to be punished for something that's essentially your natural state. "
1734,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] how awful
1735,<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe he called [NAME] his brother. You can't tell with this.
1736,<|emo_surprise|> What a valuable tool!
1737,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like i m living in the popular science world a bit more like s like why do you want to learn about this stuff so much
1738,<|emo_surprise|> Oh that's right!
1739,<|emo_surprise|> The fact that we are trying to find a team to play against them makes you believe there is a chance we might lose to them.
1740,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling so impressed with myself as i get further along now
1741,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, I think you've got me "
1742,<|emo_surprise|> Soooo...yikes
1743,"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah, I didn't know anything about the cult before I started doing research, sorry for any ignorance haha. "
1744,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, it's just me."
1746,<|emo_surprise|> What can be learned from watching you try to be nice to her..?
1747,<|emo_surprise|> Ooof. That was a brutal open shot.
1748,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! Didn't expect him to go down there. He must love his playing time.
1749,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I didn't know about that. Thanks for sharing!
1750,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised that [NAME] didn‚Äôt name [NAME] a god of warcraft
1753,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME]. He's alright but his jumper is horrid.
1754,<|emo_surprise|> How do you lose that gunfight?
1755,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh! He actually did it!
1756,<|emo_surprise|> It's the worst when it's something you were passionate about
1757,<|emo_surprise|> No it‚Äôs more like I‚Äôm saying that the media isn‚Äôt reporting the truth despite their usual obsession with it.
1758,<|emo_surprise|> Oh god yes.
1759,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is actually a fascinating and surprising choice for president.
1760,<|emo_surprise|> i actually feel a little surprised just how well he had shaken it off before going to sleep
1761,<|emo_surprise|> Well that's just... wow
1762,<|emo_surprise|> This is so cool! I love Arkansas
1763,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôve never even heard of Reddit culture before this
1765,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, it's you again."
1766,"<|emo_surprise|> Haha, damn."
1767,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, thanks! It makes me so happy that people care!"
1768,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you really outdid yourself there pal"
1769,"<|emo_surprise|> Weird, no links in this post."
1770,<|emo_surprise|> wow!!
1771,<|emo_surprise|> The real joke here is how everyone is driving like cats instead of driving like humans
1772,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling somewhat overwhelmed with the news
1773,<|emo_surprise|> He wasn't lying then and he isn't today.
1774,<|emo_surprise|> oh man
1776,<|emo_surprise|> I'm actually shocked by how well [NAME] held on against [NAME]
1777,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling this strange energy that is not pleasant
1778,<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs not a shock that a fat DnD kid is a potential violent mover.
1780,<|emo_surprise|> i could feel so shocked
1781,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder why they're not asking for a medical test when they claim to have never seen a dentist or even a family doctor.
1782,<|emo_surprise|> i feel curious and excited
1783,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a little weird when im around this community
1784,<|emo_surprise|> Oh god the ‚Äúsad‚Äù faces
1785,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling impressed just because i sat down and went over it with her
1787,<|emo_surprise|> i remember feeling amazed at how easily im able to pull it off
1788,<|emo_surprise|> Wow he was actually in shock lol
1789,"<|emo_surprise|> I don't know what [NAME] was just trying to say, but damn I thought he was having a heck of a lot more success than me and Shanny did in the previous 2 seasons."
1790,<|emo_surprise|> Omg so so did the car!
1791,<|emo_surprise|> Why? Who decided the borders? It was based off the wrong map.
1792,<|emo_surprise|> I would have thrown up right away if I had a bruise on my finger from handling a steak
1793,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Your age difference is incredibly creepy.
1794,<|emo_surprise|> I'm shocked they let a 4 win team in here
1795,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] this is so cringe
1796,<|emo_surprise|> Is this still a thing? Because I was wondering why it's still a thing. 
1797,<|emo_surprise|> > I wonder if there was a sub called ‚ÄúNews Now‚Äù. Not to mention I‚Äôve never heard of it.
1798,"<|emo_surprise|> Ah [NAME] - that's funny how it always ends, like in a movie."
1799,<|emo_surprise|> Locking up asylum seekers is like a drug to me it's just sad that we have so few effective means to combat the problem
1801,<|emo_surprise|> What is crazy is he's been at the NHL All-Star Game 5 times and has never been even on the ice for that.
1802,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, [NAME] has finally found home"
1803,<|emo_surprise|> Wow if I had to pick one I‚Äôd side with Amazon instead of Best Buy lol. Definitely gonna go this way
1804,<|emo_surprise|> wow I think I speak for people when I say I was surprised this hit that close to our house.
1805,<|emo_surprise|> He‚Äôs so calm and collected omg
1806,<|emo_surprise|> How'd you get into my brain??
1807,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I think you're the only one who thinks that!"
1809,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised they have the same amount of members.
1810,<|emo_surprise|> I was wondering what ‚Äúwhat‚Äù would happen if you hit 10k
1811,<|emo_surprise|> i feel suddenly shocked and overwhelmed
1812,<|emo_surprise|> The fuck? I can‚Äôt tell anything by looking at it :(
1813,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, I didn't know there was a movement to boycott them, thanks for the update"
1814,"<|emo_surprise|> I still think the dude looks like he‚Äôs about 5'11"" and probably just weigh 100 pounds more than [NAME] haha lol"
1816,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is a dirty chicken
1817,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling a little overwhelmed i will try and share some of my favorite things i have to look at and maybe even some of things that i might have yet to look at
1818,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh my goodness, is that who made this?!!!"
1819,<|emo_surprise|> Ohhhhh that couple!
1820,<|emo_surprise|> WTH? Just horrible.
1821,<|emo_surprise|> i feel just shocked
1822,<|emo_surprise|> What a weird way to spell [NAME].
1823,<|emo_surprise|> What a crazy post omg
1824,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME], stop making me talk about yourself. "
1825,<|emo_surprise|> How do you know he has not played since January.
1826,<|emo_surprise|> i was feeling rather overwhelmed
1827,"<|emo_surprise|> My god, that [NAME] face - never saw him smile like that"
1829,<|emo_surprise|> What a find! Glad you found it was actually books not a gun!
1830,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling fairly impressed
1831,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh cool, sorry bud"
1832,<|emo_surprise|> omg wtf are you on about now
1834,"<|emo_surprise|> No, not funny enough for that"
1835,"<|emo_surprise|> I'll remember this, I'll be a terrible parent next time, you'll help me out "
1836,<|emo_surprise|> Ah true blue love
1837,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] the person is fascinating
1838,"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] was just a pleasant surprise, honestly."
1839,<|emo_surprise|> i feel surprised that the car was so immobile without the doors open because of how well it does on these roads
1840,<|emo_surprise|> My wife and I have had it in common almost two years now it's such a struggle for us to not think the phrase.
1841,<|emo_surprise|> Really? I thought he had a good relationship with his parents.
1842,<|emo_surprise|> i would feel weird that i didnt have a lot of them
1843,<|emo_surprise|> i am not feeling so creative
1844,<|emo_surprise|> Oh hell no no
1845,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] that's a really good line if I ever met her...
1846,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you really don't know much about law though do you?"
1847,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I have no clue what that even means
1849,<|emo_surprise|> So you actually believe in [RELIGION] and not a bunch of different theories??? Wow...
1850,<|emo_surprise|> What a lucky guy.
1851,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like i am on a crazy ride
1852,<|emo_surprise|> Wow no wonder [NAME] was chosen to replace [NAME] so suddenly. So much hate for [NAME]!
1853,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow... Your sister knows Reddit. What a surprise. Thanks, Reddit."
1854,<|emo_surprise|> What a fucking weird post omg
1855,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, so this is the first I've heard of her aligning with the far right."
1856,<|emo_surprise|> Damn. I know. I would of had a text message or something at this point
1857,<|emo_surprise|> i could feel the air around me being shaken and rushed
1858,"<|emo_surprise|> *""Wow""*"
1859,<|emo_surprise|> i have been feeling quite overwhelmed with work and some of it is not quite as pleasant
1860,<|emo_surprise|> This is the sweetest
1861,<|emo_surprise|> Oh yep. What a nightmare. What can I do to you?
1862,<|emo_surprise|> Can‚Äôt believe no one guessed he‚Äôs in the Nats system
1863,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] is [NAME] really upset now.
1864,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, goodness!"
1865,<|emo_surprise|> This is what I love about cats
1866,<|emo_surprise|> oh [NAME] whoops
1867,<|emo_surprise|> Well.... I think it would be best if the whole school were to go... because all those people have absolutely nothing to do with [NAME] and his mad theories.
1868,<|emo_surprise|> Can't wait....
1870,<|emo_surprise|> i wonder what that feels like im overwhelmed
1871,<|emo_surprise|> How is it racist? I‚Äôd start out with the racism. How is it not an abuse?
1872,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised [NAME] didn't say the last bit.
1873,<|emo_surprise|> OMG she's BYEsexual
1875,<|emo_surprise|> I'm gonna go say this about [NAME] now: He'll eventually regret this.
1876,<|emo_surprise|> He knew he wasn‚Äôt supposed to be posting pics of that much weight being lifted.
1877,<|emo_surprise|> i feel strange not sure if i am over reacted to the new information or not
1878,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I'm getting off track just reading about this
1879,<|emo_surprise|> This was my joke
1880,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs just crazy. The fact you‚Äôre talking about your relationship is insane
1881,<|emo_surprise|> This is amazing.
1882,"<|emo_surprise|> How does it actually work when you put together 2 jerseys, what a stupid way to do it though?"
1883,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, that's interesting! Do you know more about that story? I'd love to read more about that on this sub. "
1884,<|emo_surprise|> What a steal that was.
1885,<|emo_surprise|> i have tried to write in a pretty positive way for so long without feeling like i could be negative
1886,<|emo_surprise|> The whole thing was jaw dropping. Not to mention the ring announcer going off on [NAME] was hilarious.
1887,<|emo_surprise|> i love the way he talks! surprising him!
1888,<|emo_surprise|> What a weird place.
1889,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, your sister has a boyfriend!"
1890,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs amazing. Good to know she is okay.
1891,<|emo_surprise|> So [NAME] actually went for it lol
1892,<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is repulsive
1894,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh! But it looks like the man is a cosplayer!
1895,<|emo_surprise|> What a fucking moronic comment
1896,<|emo_surprise|> I don‚Äôt see why [NAME] isn‚Äôt getting 1st
1897,<|emo_surprise|> You have an interesting Take 3
1898,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how [NAME] would have come off to that. Was he a better fit for a 4-3?
1899,"<|emo_surprise|> The whole thing with the giant letters ""JJW"" stand out to me."
1900,<|emo_surprise|> Damn that was dirty.
1901,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling pretty impressed with myself
1902,<|emo_surprise|> Omg she actived really good in the charity scenes but then in season 2 she goes from being a very considerate friend to a cold killer.
1903,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I know right! The one before mine. My mom was pregnant once and it was the worst time of our pregnancy.
1904,<|emo_surprise|> i feel it taunts
1905,<|emo_surprise|> oh wow I didn't know about this. sorry for my ignorance!
1909,<|emo_surprise|> What makes you say that?
1910,<|emo_surprise|> Omg i got a high from watching this
1911,<|emo_surprise|> A fuckin men
1913,"<|emo_surprise|> It's weird, I don't see this being a thing for console. I enjoyed Kojima's Old Forest Woods a lot, though. "
1914,<|emo_surprise|> This is beautiful
1915,"<|emo_surprise|> Hey guys, I was under the impression you had a sub account..."
1916,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow. ""I've never had sex before, but I might later."" Wow."
1917,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] nagy amod
1918,<|emo_surprise|> That's so awesome! I thought about doing the same thing. Never do I use anything else :)
1920,<|emo_surprise|> This is just mind blowing!
1921,<|emo_surprise|> Weird game.
1922,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, you are quite the romantic..."
1923,<|emo_surprise|> The man is truly bizarre.
1924,<|emo_surprise|> Lmao I want to cry
1925,<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs a bit surprising that't a thing came of it
1926,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Who can blame you. That video is just too damn creepy.
1927,"<|emo_surprise|> If this isn't ""the new norm"" then what the hell is it?"
1928,<|emo_surprise|> oh [NAME] [NAME] just told me what a good dad he is
1930,<|emo_surprise|> The guy is so fucking creepy.
1931,<|emo_surprise|> Wow 10/10
1932,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, talk about being [NAME]!"
1933,<|emo_surprise|> I love the burn
1935,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a weird sense of humor tonight
1936,<|emo_surprise|> i feel curious surprised and very excited
1937,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow. This is a lot to take in, but I honestly can't imagine not doing any of these."
1939,"<|emo_surprise|> That's the saddest thing I've seen on today's Reddit, I hope one day you can follow this up with a good blog post."
1941,<|emo_surprise|> i think its weird how im feeling right now
1942,<|emo_surprise|> You had a bit of a field day there! Good to know the ground rules are the same outside of water!
1943,<|emo_surprise|> Oh he dead
1944,<|emo_surprise|> i just feel really overwhelmed
1945,<|emo_surprise|> Damn I got a virus from just looking at this post
1946,<|emo_surprise|> I always thought back to this. It was like a dream.
1947,<|emo_surprise|> The surprise was even greater!
1949,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, she sounds like a really cool model."
1950,<|emo_surprise|> What? I was expecting a fat DnD kid
1951,<|emo_surprise|> i feel amazed to see that i have a friend like that
1952,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what happened to the original box set?
1953,"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]? We could actually get something worthwhile out of this. Wait, no."
1954,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling somewhat overwhelmed and am wondering as to why i am so curious
1955,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, no wonder this is getting attention"
1956,<|emo_surprise|> Wow thanks for sharing that. That sounds awesome. What if this is you guys secret?
1957,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that is the first I‚Äôve heard of that. I‚Äôm really wondering what happened"
1958,<|emo_surprise|> Omg no way she's 30 lol
1959,<|emo_surprise|> He wasn't even trying!!
1960,"<|emo_surprise|> >it‚Äôs not illegal to have sex with dogs? Wow... Not a shocking finding for you, anyway."
1961,<|emo_surprise|> That's so crazy to hear about what's happened in Venezuela. I'm glad I called in before it happened. I hope it doesn't happen again.
1963,<|emo_surprise|> Oh noooo. Imagine thinking this comment was okay and not making a fuss over it.
1964,<|emo_surprise|> Wauw! Those weapons are awesome!
1965,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder why the cops haven't arrested her yet tbh...
1966,<|emo_surprise|> Omg my eyes!
1967,<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit!
1968,<|emo_surprise|> > It's very telling that they're posting this nearly daily. Probably more than the [NAME] on this sub.
1969,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow they changed their minds, is there any way I can complain?"
1970,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] a fucking hero
1971,<|emo_surprise|> Ouch....
1972,<|emo_surprise|> i feel there was a horrible accident
1973,"<|emo_surprise|> >""I""m a person not a machine Well damn, I thought machine learning was about finding those edge cases where machine learning could not solve, but I was wrong"
1974,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] this is horrible
1975,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I thought there were more posts like this...
1976,<|emo_surprise|> Weird flex.
1978,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is not impressed.
1979,<|emo_surprise|> i feel there is a really beautiful message in there with you all there are some very creative reasons behind that
1980,<|emo_surprise|> You're an amazing momma and dad too! Hugs to you!
1981,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised these don't already have an Apple Music store.
1982,"<|emo_surprise|> Can't speak for that, [NAME] can."
1983,<|emo_surprise|> i feel surprised to say that this is one of the few places i ve been that i actually go
1984,"<|emo_surprise|> No, I wasnt in the mood to find out how many people had already played, but I will gladly give this a try regardless. "
1985,<|emo_surprise|> OMG dad! I‚Äôm really starting to think about doing this
1986,<|emo_surprise|> My favorite [NAME] defeated him handily and has never lost a title since.
1988,<|emo_surprise|> omg yes!!!!
1989,<|emo_surprise|> I was surprised by the lack of options. Most of the available classes seem pretty useless.
1990,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, I didn't know this! I'm sorry for your loss!"
1991,<|emo_surprise|> OMG. The third picture is real. Is [NAME]?
1992,<|emo_surprise|> What a sweet revenge story! One of my favorite readings!
1993,<|emo_surprise|> I don‚Äôt think [NAME] would have made it back to the Big 12 if he was injured as he is now.
1994,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that‚Äôs a lot of bp
1995,<|emo_surprise|> And I've never before watched it online. So I haveno idea what [NAME] is talking about.
1996,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you‚Äôre an animal..."
1997,<|emo_surprise|> I love how the last picture is a close-up of part of the face
1998,"<|emo_surprise|> Ah yeah, that"
1999,"<|emo_surprise|> Yesssss.... Have fun with that ""got hurt"" crap"
2000,<|emo_surprise|> This is the first I've seen of this... wow.
2001,"<|emo_surprise|> I actually really like this, better than the original!"
2002,<|emo_surprise|> It's a pretty common saying that a guy just gotta sleep with a girl. I like it.
2003,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you quite the romantic..."
2004,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow at that age, you wouldn't be out of jail if you didn't have a $10k+ debt."
2006,<|emo_surprise|> Wow!!
2008,<|emo_surprise|> I am still SHOOK. He said he had no idea what they were talking about. I really feel like he was completely uninformed.
2009,<|emo_surprise|> It wasnt even a hit that was the catch though.
2010,<|emo_surprise|> i feel very shocked and disappointed
2011,"<|emo_surprise|> It literally took me 10 minutes to list all the reasons why we should celebrate this, from their selfish embrace of progress to the fact that half the population are still alive to just how insane the leaders in our country can be."
2012,<|emo_surprise|> What does that really mean? What is he talking about?
2013,<|emo_surprise|> Lol this is the first I‚Äôve heard of her aligning with al qaeda 
2014,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how much each person's online footprint is.
2015,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, your sister is in abusive relationship, what a surprise :)"
2016,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I thought he'd be a fat moron.
2017,<|emo_surprise|> Lmao what a surprise i never saw coming
2018,"<|emo_surprise|> What a weird way to find out that you are indeed a ""rad"""
2019,<|emo_surprise|> i get that feeling as well as the odd horror story
2020,<|emo_surprise|> Wow you guys are insane
2021,<|emo_surprise|> I'm so amazed [NAME] ignored him for so long.
2022,<|emo_surprise|> i just feel really amazing
2023,<|emo_surprise|> omg I‚Äôm so surprised i clicked this link

2029,<|emo_surprise|> Wow what a wake up call
2030,<|emo_surprise|> The fact that it's not a [NAME] t shirt justows it even more off.
2031,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised she didn't catch her brother lancing it
2032,<|emo_surprise|> Omg yes lol. Dont call this a honeypot. The point is that she is not giving us anything new.
2033,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs absolutely amazing. I‚Äôm very happy for [NAME] too. Wish him nothing but the best!
2035,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like im a strange bird who cant fly
2037,<|emo_surprise|> This is theiest thing i've ever seen

2039,<|emo_surprise|> Ah I didn't see it..I thought the other comment was from the start...
2040,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a bit surprised to find it on this sub
2041,<|emo_surprise|> i feel as though im being tortured inside
2042,<|emo_surprise|> i feel surprised that a man in his fifties even bothered to give such a call

2045,<|emo_surprise|> i have a feeling this will just go south
2046,<|emo_surprise|> How did I not know it was him?

2050,<|emo_surprise|> i was feeling really weird
2051,<|emo_surprise|> This is so awesome!
2052,<|emo_surprise|> Well it wasnt a surprise. I have had some really bad vertigo when i ride a bike in foggy weather. My vertigo has actually vanished completely
2053,<|emo_surprise|> The only thing I'm missing here IS [NAME]!!
2054,"<|emo_surprise|> No, the issue is that the tax rate for those at the top is actually much higher than for everyone else"
2055,<|emo_surprise|> Yikes lmao no idea what that was
2056,<|emo_surprise|> i really dont know what i expected i was left to feel amazed that i dare to call myself a young adult and still so young

2069,<|emo_surprise|> Wow there it is
2070,<|emo_surprise|> I had no idea. She looks just like [NAME]
2071,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised she let her Instagram do all the work for her.
2072,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you got me "
2073,"<|emo_surprise|> The surprise is, she's incredibly beautiful."
2074,<|emo_surprise|> i actually feel stunned and wondering how its all been.
2076,<|emo_surprise|> Oh ok nice
2077,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] this movie is bad
2078,<|emo_surprise|> The only thing we had going for us was a 2 year contract so that's what we got.
2079,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! So you actually did it! So you *did*!
2081,"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, look at that body"
2082,<|emo_surprise|> i have to give it to the guy i met here who is the reason why i feel so comfortable with this group
2083,<|emo_surprise|> I find it strange how people can get so caught up and ignore such issues as a health care system with a single payer program.
2084,<|emo_surprise|> The only one to have a chance today was [NAME]. I went crazy for a moment lol
2086,<|emo_surprise|> i still had a blank space so i did i moved to the other page of the second page and read your full story
2087,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, the comments are still coming in..."
2088,"<|emo_surprise|> Is this a known issue? If so, I'd like to try to reproduce it."
2089,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I wish I could buy this as a gift for a loved one.
2090,<|emo_surprise|> That's actually incredible. Thank you!
2091,<|emo_surprise|> i began feeling really weird
2092,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]... I wish I could say the same. But I can't.
2093,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like im doing something that will be a surprise
2094,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] IS TRYING TO GET HIS ASS RIPPED OFF.
2095,<|emo_surprise|> This is my nightmare
2096,<|emo_surprise|> Omg i love it
2097,<|emo_surprise|> The only thing left from my childhood is my fondness for systems and generation stuff
2098,<|emo_surprise|> Lmao no wonder it‚Äôs so cheap. They can‚Äôt make them big :(
2099,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I knew you had a family!!
2100,"<|emo_surprise|> You'd think they'd be happy to help with the cleaning for $3,000.... Wow"
2101,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow...
2102,<|emo_surprise|> i feel kind of surprised that they didnt have a little piece of candy
2103,<|emo_surprise|> i feel surprised when people say they like me even if i just dont agree
2105,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, what a finish"
2106,<|emo_surprise|> Damn I miss the north hills bottom dollar... they used to be great. You can buy a used mattress for about $20 in the bayshore
2108,<|emo_surprise|> What did you get [NAME] for? He has played only 14 minutes this game.
2109,"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, I really can't believe that's what we did, but I am glad"
2110,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] no wonder we don't have a [NAME] ouija board in our school

2115,<|emo_surprise|> i think im trying to work on feeling more emotional
2117,<|emo_surprise|> Omg no way a woman of color was surprised by this tbh
2118,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs terrifying
2119,<|emo_surprise|> This is a lovely tumblr account
2121,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I'm glad I grew up killing infants at hospitals instead of being on my nokia
2123,<|emo_surprise|> I don't know any but my own I have no idea anything like 10 years from back now
2124,<|emo_surprise|> i feel shocked to learn that duluth has more students than us
2125,<|emo_surprise|> Oh god it‚Äôs happened before
2126,<|emo_surprise|> i was still feeling a bit overwhelmed but i assured myself that if i didnt meet my goals the next day on i'd be fine.
2128,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a bit stunned to say that i actually came across this sub last night
2129,<|emo_surprise|> My parents died outside the church I went to school with. My older sister and I still live with them today!
2130,<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs all good man
2131,<|emo_surprise|> I think it's safe to say we never really know everything there is to know about the Holy See.
2132,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling a little surprised that we didnt make the cut
2133,"<|emo_surprise|> Damn I thought he said: ""time to make a deal with gods"""
2134,<|emo_surprise|> Happy Cake day!
2135,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Maybe her ex would have been upset if she told him she had a boyfriend.
2137,<|emo_surprise|> It's like how most games in this world are - literally - an excuse for not having good people
2138,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised they didn‚Äôt name it ‚ÄúLazyMan‚Äù
2140,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh boy, they did/"
2141,<|emo_surprise|> It was a nice compliment.
2142,"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah, but it did help when your stepdad insulted you on the flight. I can see how that would work for him though! "
2143,<|emo_surprise|> Well that makes sense.
2145,<|emo_surprise|> OMG! I'm so sorry you had to go through that!
2146,<|emo_surprise|> What a fucking thot*
2147,<|emo_surprise|> What a hilarious yet sad story.
2148,<|emo_surprise|> And the new ones are hideous
2149,<|emo_surprise|> This thread is too damn interesting
2150,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] and [NAME] are both blessed to have their children. Be happy for them.
2151,<|emo_surprise|> She's dead af
2152,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs so awesome!!! I wish you have a boyfriend who can make the same amount of them

2154,<|emo_surprise|> i can not wait for our miracle baby boy
2155,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] oh my [NAME]
2156,"<|emo_surprise|> A couple things: 1.) I feel very sorry for your daughter because she was probably high when you were with her, 2.) Now she‚Äôs a college student and probably a year away from having kids!!!"
2157,<|emo_surprise|> I find it so crazy that both the Knicks and Suns are in this same boat with [NAME] and [NAME].
2158,<|emo_surprise|> *lo and behold was a huge influence on my gaming tastes.
2159,"<|emo_surprise|> That's actually amazing, didn't know of that before."
2160,<|emo_surprise|> And that wig? Wow.

2162,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling overwhelmed and it s wonderful
2163,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling quite overwhelmed
2164,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I didn't know!
2165,<|emo_surprise|> He was too busy playing God mode to notice I took a picture of him...
2166,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, there are some really weird things out there."
2167,<|emo_surprise|> I still can't believe he said that
2169,<|emo_surprise|> I had a near panic attack after reading this. Yikes
2171,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what his arms look like...
2172,<|emo_surprise|> i can feel the way the wind blows around my hair playing off the color of the hair that i'm going to be wearing
2173,<|emo_surprise|> Why [RELIGION] people put up with this? It's the norm but they find it disgusting.
2174,<|emo_surprise|> Well then why can't I?
2175,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like i m on the verge of tears at all the sounds we have in the background and is it because im playing music or just the fact that im feeling so overwhelmed and overwhelmed by everything around me
2176,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, really?"
2177,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is why I love reddit.
2178,<|emo_surprise|> This is so cool! I love it

2186,<|emo_surprise|> I've had sleep paralysis once and it was really bad.
2187,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I would not be surprised. I wonder if they charge for next day delivery."
2188,<|emo_surprise|> He is not a natural born democrat.
2189,<|emo_surprise|> Well that's quite Interesting tbh
2190,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] I LOVE YOU DEEP SHIT

2197,<|emo_surprise|> i was feeling funny on tuesday so i ate my cake and took some guacamole
2198,<|emo_surprise|> i was feeling a little more than a little overwhelmed
2199,<|emo_surprise|> I find it somewhat surprising that both houses are looking very different.
2200,<|emo_surprise|> Oh that's awesome news. I wouldn't be surprised if he takes it to the E.U.
2201,<|emo_surprise|> i was feeling really doubtful about myself at this point but since you have reassured me that what i am doing is ok and what i do is safe i can finally start feeling better
2202,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! No wonder theians still hate them
2203,<|emo_surprise|> Omg! I love the burn

2208,<|emo_surprise|> What a valuable tool.
2209,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, wow, you don't have any ""experience"" either?"
2210,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that's incredible. I'm surprised he didn't go with the more familiar ""we're all doomed in some way, no one can save us"" line."
2211,"<|emo_surprise|> Omg! A6,000pts!? Yes! Those guys are scumbags. I'm so sorry for the loss [NAME] and [NAME] have sustained."
2213,<|emo_surprise|> And why they don‚Äôt have a tv room but a fucking cinema room??? I fucking love this place!!
2214,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like i was watching someone else's story and i watched a video

2222,<|emo_surprise|> Omg no I couldn‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs talking about himself‚Äôs drug use or just how messed up his mind is. I hope his life is better now.
2223,<|emo_surprise|> i was feeling kind of doubtful last night
2224,<|emo_surprise|> Weird that you link to a third party ad. wow
2225,<|emo_surprise|> Haha I thought he seemed really upset that [NAME] didn't pick [NAME] üòÇ
2226,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I can‚Äôt believe you actually made that claim.
2227,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Never seen one like this.
2228,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like he doesnt want to be the mother
2229,<|emo_surprise|> It really is. One of my least favorites having to do it in a video
2230,"<|emo_surprise|> Hm I think the biggest surprise is still no [NAME], surprising that after he failed the drug test and blew his cover they decided to go after him."
2231,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling overwhelmed by all these lovely things
2232,<|emo_surprise|> i cant help but feel overwhelmed
2233,"<|emo_surprise|> What a fucking asshole. Good riddance to sorts of shit, I'm so sorry."
2234,<|emo_surprise|> It's a fucking wonder a kid who's lived in his parent's house only moments longer isn't already dead from diarrhea
2235,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] was literally hit by a car once when he was a kid
2236,<|emo_surprise|> Omg a case of munchausen!
2237,"<|emo_surprise|> There, I said it."

2241,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I know! I forgot about my super sweet Give aole a bone exchange pack
2242,<|emo_surprise|> They‚Äôre calling the cops to block the road. The cop seems genuinely shocked.
2244,<|emo_surprise|> I'm also scared.
2245,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my good lord. Please do more of them please.
2247,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, not surprising from a guy who was once caught shoplifting 12 cases of beer"
2249,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I am so sorry that happened to you, it‚Äôs something I often deal with."
2250,<|emo_surprise|> What a nightmare.

2259,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] these are some of the worst I've seen
2260,<|emo_surprise|> The last sentence pains me
2261,<|emo_surprise|> What a lovely story!
2262,"<|emo_surprise|> Well, I'm not surprised he's angry at the thought of working with women."
2263,<|emo_surprise|> The good thing is [NAME] also played for the Chargers and then sat out a season as well.
2264,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] good one
2265,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a bit overwhelmed with it all
2266,<|emo_surprise|> i can feel them taking it in turns and feeling curious
2267,<|emo_surprise|> Happy Cake day! üêª
2268,<|emo_surprise|> i always feel surprised when i think about how little time a lot of these women spend with their kids
2269,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, what a find"
2270,<|emo_surprise|> I don't think either of them are trying to be obnoxious I think they're genuinely shocked to find out just how much support they've gotten.
2271,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, great news bro! "
2273,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I didn‚Äôt know I‚Äôd see a comrade here

2285,<|emo_surprise|> Thanks I was wondering what you were talking about.
2286,<|emo_surprise|> And I'm wondering what the joke is.
2287,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised they're still legal, though."

2298,"<|emo_surprise|> I wonder about your wife. Did she ask you to put your shirt back on or did she say that ""no""?"
2299,<|emo_surprise|> You're so Right!?!

2307,<|emo_surprise|> i feel amazed at how i can do things and how i can live things when they cant happen to me
2308,<|emo_surprise|> How is [NAME] even an argument [NAME]? One of the dumbest players I've seen in a while. Can't even argue with his stats.
2309,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I‚Äôm not surprised his family didn‚Äôt find out
2311,<|emo_surprise|> i will tell you i was feeling a little weird when i decided to get in the car
2312,"<|emo_surprise|> I didn‚Äôt catch that, thanks. It was literally just [NAME] talking."
2313,"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is really what's keeping me up at night? Like, fuck who started it"
2314,<|emo_surprise|> I'm a little stunned they haven't done that yet tbh
2315,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, you are the best! Keep up the amazing work!!!"
2316,<|emo_surprise|> And it‚Äôs almost certain the top 2 choices would be from big pharma and mega energy companies luring people away from healthcare and into energy industries...
2318,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] I'm so sorry. I hope your girlfriend can relate.
2319,<|emo_surprise|> I just realized I never posted a picture of the actual tshirt
2320,"<|emo_surprise|> Ah man, I thought this was a really big deal. Thanks for sharing! /s"
2321,<|emo_surprise|> omg I can cry at this
2322,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling a little funny at least right now
2323,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I can't believe you accepted the job without having any previous experience."
2324,<|emo_surprise|> They could have easily given him the odd one. What's sad is that everyone thinks he's OP.
2325,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling kind of weird today
2326,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that's some impressive brainpower."
2327,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôve never seen a more adorable description for a picture in my life!
2328,<|emo_surprise|> i feel funny cause every time i wear them i feel more ridiculous
2329,"<|emo_surprise|> No, the important thing is his mental health after he broke his jaw twice."
2330,<|emo_surprise|> i cant help but feel a little helpless
2331,<|emo_surprise|> That sounds amazing. You know it's out now btw. I'm pretty spoiled on PSN. My favorite devs are always on there xD
2332,<|emo_surprise|> OMG.... Dad
2333,<|emo_surprise|> i honestly had been reluctant to go but then i read about a guy being sued by his ex wife for emotional neglect and i couldn't not feel this way
2334,<|emo_surprise|> Omg yes
2335,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] looks so cool in these pics...
2336,<|emo_surprise|> This is what I was thinking too. Lol
2337,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a little overwhelmed after doing this
2338,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, your sister has a fascinating sense of humor"
2339,<|emo_surprise|> That's a cool find! I wonder what triggered this episode!
2340,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] it‚Äôs happening again
2341,<|emo_surprise|> I'm not surprised they're allowed to be in the same city. Is Newry City weird?
2342,<|emo_surprise|> OMG this team! Where did we go wrong?
2343,<|emo_surprise|> i also feel amazed that the boy who said nothing when i went for a hug last night was willing to go out of his way to hold out for that
2345,"<|emo_surprise|> Well I'm also wondering, are you under contract or done?"
2346,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I think I see cheekbones! (outrage face)
2347,<|emo_surprise|> Omg I love this thank you
2348,<|emo_surprise|> My man!
2349,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I didn't see that coming tbh
2350,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm so glad!
2351,<|emo_surprise|> Oh sh*t man don‚Äôt take the wrong train
2352,<|emo_surprise|> Omg it‚Äôs a [NAME] shirt!!!
2355,"<|emo_surprise|> Well, I'll be honest and say I was surprised when the cast got together to vote for [NAME]. A few things haven't happened in a while that made everything that much of a shock."
2356,<|emo_surprise|> i feel overwhelmed im happy
2357,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling really overwhelmed
2358,<|emo_surprise|> i feel surprised how fast he is accepting of me and that he is so understanding
2359,<|emo_surprise|> I see you have friends that don‚Äôt watch porn either... nice ;)
2360,"<|emo_surprise|> You mean *after* this comment? Who decided to comment ""after""?"
2361,<|emo_surprise|> i feel extremely intimidated by him
2362,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what it would be like to have a penis.
2363,<|emo_surprise|> i was feeling curious and curious i knew it was a good thing
2364,<|emo_surprise|> Happy birthday to him
2365,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like im living in wonderland
2366,"<|emo_surprise|> They always say ""a car accident is the spontaneous development of tissue"" "
2367,<|emo_surprise|> i can t help but feel a little overwhelmed
2368,"<|emo_surprise|> The guy who reviews my products is my absolute favorite person in the whole world, he‚Äôs the reason I don‚Äôt have to ask, I really wish he was able to do this... "
2369,<|emo_surprise|> i still feel as if im completely amazed that i ve never been to a party before
2370,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that‚Äôs just... wow that‚Äôs so amazing... Can you imagine a scenario like that in the real world (I know there are lots of awful things in here).
2371,<|emo_surprise|> OMG I had a feeling there was some illegal weed growing out there. I don‚Äôt even know what to say üôÑ
2374,<|emo_surprise|> This is the first time I‚Äôve ever seen anybody say that about their relationship! What a crazy thing to believe!
2375,"<|emo_surprise|> Well, let us know if you do, and let us know how it all goes."
2376,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! Thanks for sharing that! He definitely has a good sense of humor
2377,"<|emo_surprise|> Hey, is there a special place in Hell for these people? (No, it's the rich, red states, where people can actually find these)"
2378,<|emo_surprise|> i guess i had it coming for a long time but it finally hit me and now i m feeling pretty weird but not completely dead
2379,<|emo_surprise|> i feel shocked and helpless
2380,<|emo_surprise|> Wow no wonder crime is going up if these morons are in charge.
2381,<|emo_surprise|> How terrifying.
2382,<|emo_surprise|> Wow so much younger but sounds mature. What are his ages?
2383,<|emo_surprise|> That looks like an oldie but a goodie.
2384,<|emo_surprise|> This is my favorite wild memory
2385,<|emo_surprise|> Oh god there‚Äôs no way [NAME] should lose this game. We defeated them 3-0 already.
2386,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. What other jobs offer health benefits?
2387,<|emo_surprise|> Yeah now I‚Äôm wondering why these questions keep cropping up.
2388,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised they lived together since she seems extremely cold
2389,<|emo_surprise|> My condolences.
2390,<|emo_surprise|> Omg yeah.
2391,"<|emo_surprise|> Damn. The real answer is ""no"" and ""don't."""
2392,<|emo_surprise|> There's a lot I didn't know about [NAME] other than he's actually interesting
2394,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] this was bad
2395,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling a little overwhelmed with everything so im going to post something about it later
2396,<|emo_surprise|> The fact that his bed was next to hers was extremely creepy!
2397,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, not even halfway there. Thank you!"
2398,<|emo_surprise|> Weird game lol
2399,<|emo_surprise|> i was feeling all strange but then i relaxed
2400,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Yes
2401,<|emo_surprise|> Wow..!
2403,<|emo_surprise|> The real joke is that all the people in this thread are either quite ignorant or have little to no interaction with the actual community.
2404,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre saying that
2405,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. That is shockingly uncool.
2407,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm shocked he didn‚Äôt name his son [NAME]
2408,<|emo_surprise|> This was literally me!
2409,<|emo_surprise|> Ahhh the city of brotherly love <3
2410,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG the bra hanging out of that dress is rebellious. I mean, he's wearing comfortable clothes everyday"
2411,<|emo_surprise|> How amazing is it to be so incredibly disgusted and surprised at such incredibly similar things? It absolutely ssles me out.
2412,<|emo_surprise|> Who has the biggest penis? I was surprised to see a picture of [NAME] and still am not.
2413,<|emo_surprise|> If it's true I'm sad for the workers. I would vote to fire them all
2414,<|emo_surprise|> I hope so. I have very few memories that don't make me flail around in frantic circles for hours after
2415,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, the ""hmm"" sounds..."
2417,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] no!
2418,<|emo_surprise|> i love it! :)
2419,"<|emo_surprise|> Hey, if you're a fan of theNING, you might like this - thanks!"
2420,<|emo_surprise|> oh no no no
2421,<|emo_surprise|> I never thought someone would ask that but damn...
2422,<|emo_surprise|> Wow so glad to see my Reddit and BBM info is no longer public record
2423,<|emo_surprise|> Oh absolutely!
2424,<|emo_surprise|> i feel amazed as if something has happened to me which is a first
2425,<|emo_surprise|> Can't believe she actually said that
2426,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you haven't been on a Reddit sub in a while."
2427,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. You‚Äôre hardly unique on that one either.
2428,<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit I thought she had a kid with him tbh
2430,<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe they used [NAME] voice for that part.
2432,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, so you admit to being a pedophile. Wow."
2433,<|emo_surprise|> Really surprised I clicked this link.
2434,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] yes.
2435,<|emo_surprise|> I hope they make it for both series. I love [NAME] and [NAME] but I think this could be a great team for them to build off.
2436,<|emo_surprise|> Oh no she didn't
2437,<|emo_surprise|> Hahaha damn you are troll of the highest order
2438,<|emo_surprise|> What happened??
2439,<|emo_surprise|> What is scary? Is it the face?
2440,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh yeah, was that the only problem you had with the game - or are you still having issues?"
2441,"<|emo_surprise|> wow, thank you! you have really opened my eyes a lot to the crazy places that can happen in the world."
2442,<|emo_surprise|> I'm wondering how you account for the fact he does whatever the hell he does.
2443,<|emo_surprise|> i feel weird about the whole thing
2444,"<|emo_surprise|> Ah, I thought he was speaking of the same thing because it's not, in fact, a new development."
2445,<|emo_surprise|> i feel it s a bit strange not seeing them together again but i feel like we were an amazing couple
2446,<|emo_surprise|> i feel suddenly very strange
2447,<|emo_surprise|> Hey now.
2448,<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit I‚Äôm so impressed.
2449,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. It‚Äôs incredibly condescending and cringy. I can‚Äôt believe it
2450,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh!!!!!!!!! I thought you liked Lucky's.
2451,"<|emo_surprise|> Lol, you had a different view."
2452,<|emo_surprise|> Wow she gets a lot of weird looks omg
2453,<|emo_surprise|> i think i just have that feeling that i should be excited about this
2454,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, a double amputee!"
2456,<|emo_surprise|> I am surprised there is a Reddit community for Weird Al.
2457,<|emo_surprise|> I can‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs in New Orleans.
2458,<|emo_surprise|> I was wondering that too ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
2459,<|emo_surprise|> i love you hahahahha
2460,"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, I missed that. üò¢"
2461,<|emo_surprise|> What a terrible list
2462,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME], now I really am wondering how I got away with that"
2463,<|emo_surprise|> I've wondered this too!
2464,<|emo_surprise|> If I don‚Äôt get some ice time soon my job is done.
2465,<|emo_surprise|> Damn. I remember back in '91 and remember the game. My emotions were running wild
2467,"<|emo_surprise|> Yup, sorry for the confusion :D"
2468,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I'm sorry you had to deal with all that."
2469,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow! Noted, I see three different colored balls."
2470,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised she didn't say ""him"" in response to why he wanted to come see her."
2471,<|emo_surprise|> I think it's pretty safe to assume that your wife worked out with a guy who didn't actually show you his penis.
2472,<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is creepy.
2473,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like its a pleasant surprise
2474,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I never noticed that either. Can you point me to the video?
2478,<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs weird that I went 6 for 30 against Syracuse last year. I‚Äôm definitely not a shooter
2479,<|emo_surprise|> This would be so amazing if we had a ring. How about we name it after [NAME] instead of [NAME]? Also would cost less too
2480,<|emo_surprise|> Oh dear.
2481,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you have someore there. Looks like we got a new hero "
2482,<|emo_surprise|> Wow... You sure got me. I was just calling in sick and wondering what the appropriate response would be.
2484,"<|emo_surprise|> Lol, a lot of people on here don't even know what we stand for lol"
2485,<|emo_surprise|> Wow did not know [NAME] was still alive
2486,<|emo_surprise|> Wauw! Those weapons are awesome!!
2487,<|emo_surprise|> Omg she reminded me of Ginger from Ginger Snaps! I'm so in love
2488,<|emo_surprise|> It's not unusual for a man in his fifties to feel appalled at the idea of asking for a woman's card.
2489,<|emo_surprise|> The comments on this thread are what I expected but wow you did an amazing job. Not sure what [NAME] and [NAME] are up to but good for ya!
2490,<|emo_surprise|> > it's all going to be okay Thanks
2491,<|emo_surprise|> YOOOOOOOHN
2492,"<|emo_surprise|> Omg, it's real"
2493,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] how incredibly dangerous
2495,"<|emo_surprise|> It was a nice break from usual fare, too. was just about as obnoxious as the game itself."
2496,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my good gracious
2497,<|emo_surprise|> Wow she is pretty fit
2498,<|emo_surprise|> What the fuck is [NAME] doing in a business suit
2499,<|emo_surprise|> No wonder crime is going up in these inner cities.
2500,<|emo_surprise|> i feel more than a little curious
2501,<|emo_surprise|> There must have been an accident.
2502,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] do you even post music on your SoundCloud? I can't even tell who you are from there (IE Canada)
2503,<|emo_surprise|> I'm so surprised he didn't make [NAME] cry...
2504,"<|emo_surprise|> I think this was a case of me not trusting him, but I'm very open to information"
2505,<|emo_surprise|> Wow just wow. What a weird thing to say. Jokes are evenweier now.
2506,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised he's still using it as an argument.
2508,"<|emo_surprise|> wow, thanks. not sure how I would have phrased it if it came out that way. "
2509,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, what a steal that was."
2510,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like ive been intimidated and not taken seriously for a long time
2511,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm getting an alert when you type something that isn‚Äôt funny lol
2512,<|emo_surprise|> You are so right! I have a feeling this is the start of a very interesting thread!
2513,<|emo_surprise|> OMG where did I even find that out?
2514,<|emo_surprise|> i feel i am so shocked
2515,"<|emo_surprise|> i dont think people who have these beliefs are seriously making any of the more serious, serious misrepresentations that many of them would believe"
2517,<|emo_surprise|> Yow thats gnarly.
2518,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs a lot of karma!
2519,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is making the crowd's reaction to him after he is called for 3 fouls look like this
2520,<|emo_surprise|> wow i wasnt expecting that! awesome news!
2521,<|emo_surprise|> Woot! Happy New Year!
2522,<|emo_surprise|> Ohhhh so it's not weird that I think it is.
2523,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, I never realized there was a history of this happening."
2524,<|emo_surprise|> Oh man oh man
2525,<|emo_surprise|> I'm sorry. What country is it again? I don't speak the same language.
2527,<|emo_surprise|> This is actually the third one I've seen of this...this is just bizarre.
2530,<|emo_surprise|> WTH?!?!? Just horrible!
2531,"<|emo_surprise|> What happens in a world of 20,000 words?"
2532,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! You are lucky your doctor prescribed it!
2533,<|emo_surprise|> Happy cake day üçï
2534,<|emo_surprise|> Ah good grief.
2535,<|emo_surprise|> Oh man that's so sweet tbh
2536,<|emo_surprise|> Wow it was a hit and it made the video
2537,"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, I didn't know we had a newscaster on the Today show."
2538,<|emo_surprise|> i feeling a little bit dazed out there and looking for my car
2539,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I have never heard of this. Do you happen to know if it's a NY address?
2540,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised Reddit doesn‚Äôt provide a desktop client for Mac or Linux (I don‚Äôt have a development environment from 2008 though).
2541,"<|emo_surprise|> I thought I was the only one! Thanks for the report, we did notice an unusual number of hits."
2542,<|emo_surprise|> Holy crap.....
2543,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like ive been distracted because i didnt have time to update on my trip and was left waiting for a whole day before i finally realized i had gone over my travel plans.
2544,<|emo_surprise|> Omg I cant believe it worked.
2545,<|emo_surprise|> It would be so weird not to feature her
2546,"<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what the ""it's all good man"" bit is about."
2547,<|emo_surprise|> She probably got winded while doing these things...
2549,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like im always being surprised about the things that im wondering about
2551,<|emo_surprise|> Is it weird to be a fan of the Knicks without also being a die hardder than everyone else?
2552,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what would happen if we used [NAME] as our QB...
2553,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] oh no
2554,<|emo_surprise|> i like to think i am living in some kind of a weird world of yours where you like to play along with me knowing that your experience of strange is in some way accurate
2556,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] isn‚Äôt [NAME] anymore i think you‚Äôre pretty well assured he is.
2557,"<|emo_surprise|> Omg this guy who lives in Germany has apparently never seen a vagina, never even heard of the term vagina, so he can't imagine a UK one!!"
2558,<|emo_surprise|> This is amazing oh so good
2559,<|emo_surprise|> This is r/funny now
2560,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] I fucking love these
2561,<|emo_surprise|> i feel absolutely shocked that such a respected and generous person could do such disgusting things
2562,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like im living in a postnuclear nightmare world
2563,<|emo_surprise|> i hope and pray god will tell me on christmas how im doing in school and i can feel more faithful to this god and my god
2564,<|emo_surprise|> What a weirdo.
2565,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, yesssss!"
2566,"<|emo_surprise|> Hey, at least you could relate to her!"
2567,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I'm surprised she didn't name him [NAME]
2569,<|emo_surprise|> i feel weird doing this now
2570,<|emo_surprise|> They're both bad.
2571,<|emo_surprise|> Wow so you are finally admitting you are a muh bigot
2572,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm amazed he didn't say, ""IT'S LAMBDA OLD"""
2573,<|emo_surprise|> Wow there is not a single legit source on this story... WTH?
2574,"<|emo_surprise|> Weird how popular it is, especially on the GFW."
2575,"<|emo_surprise|> What a rude, obnoxious nag."
2576,<|emo_surprise|> Happy cake day Mr bot
2577,<|emo_surprise|> wow your sister is a lifesaver. love this.
2578,<|emo_surprise|> Omg no way I would miss this
2579,<|emo_surprise|> Holy crap.
2580,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I see so many different posts with the same title
2581,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I was wrong about them not having the power"
2582,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh man, I read this inasted. Yikes. I can't imagine I'm a fan but yikes on yikes."
2584,<|emo_surprise|> i just keep thinking wow thats the first time id feel like that in a long time
2585,<|emo_surprise|> How did he just run out of money for a new gun? What the fuck was that
2586,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, your a pro! I'm glad to hear you got your degree though. üíó"
2587,"<|emo_surprise|> Hey listen I can give him a whack about it, he‚Äôs an ass"
2589,"<|emo_surprise|> Omg I just made a Reddit account to support [NAME], but I see so many dumb comments..."
2590,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling really amused actually
2591,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME]. Is this real? That is so creepy.
2592,"<|emo_surprise|> I never once took this as ""it's not the right wing, it's the left wing!"" This was fucking OMG YESSSSS CJJJJJJJJ"
2593,<|emo_surprise|> Really wow. I‚Äôve only been on Reddit a week but this is already on top of it
2596,"<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs a matter of personal taste what you enjoy most - whether it‚Äôs a film, song, poem or video."
2598,<|emo_surprise|> i feel weird about how much i love the new movie
2599,<|emo_surprise|> Soooo [NAME] is on fire!!!
2600,<|emo_surprise|> She actually got off? But [NAME] was screaming her up so loud...
2601,<|emo_surprise|> Oh for sure. At least I think I do now.
2602,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, I feel like I know this person. is so awesome."
2603,<|emo_surprise|> i feel surprised i did it
2604,<|emo_surprise|> OMG... Dad!
2605,<|emo_surprise|> Omg yesss!
2606,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh damn it, guess i messed up my order too? Thanks!"
2608,<|emo_surprise|> i dont mind feeling shocked
2609,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I‚Äôm hearing you mate and calm down. We‚Äôre all in this together dude.
2610,<|emo_surprise|> Ouch. That's too much.
2611,<|emo_surprise|> My surprise too. He was hardly a household name in Britain then.
2612,<|emo_surprise|> Wow the kids are turning 14 in just 8 months.
2613,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like the story itself would be a lot longer if we broke it down and wrote out all the events line by line
2614,<|emo_surprise|> Wow 5 downvotes in 3 minutes
2615,<|emo_surprise|> Happy cake day to him
2616,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, it was *Thomas the nuclear bomb*! Yikes."
2617,<|emo_surprise|> Oh it‚Äôs actually a r/tworeddit sub oh wow wow
2618,"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME], I thought he went off the deep end and not toward the goalpost. Not even close. "
2619,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, my good lord. What are the odds of that happening?"
2620,<|emo_surprise|> I am a big fan of this game and having two years like this is amazing.
2621,<|emo_surprise|> Thanks I hate it I love it
2623,<|emo_surprise|> How surprising it is that a man I've known for several years is now posting these sorts of things online.
2624,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, hate that!"
2625,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is a fucking monster
2626,<|emo_surprise|> Oh that's just... Wow.
2627,<|emo_surprise|> Happy little lies.
2628,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh!! I did not know! Oh no!
2629,"<|emo_surprise|> My [NAME] thinks the new generation of daddys are all sex kittens, they all seem to hate the old daddies!!"
2630,<|emo_surprise|> *oh god oh fuck*
2631,<|emo_surprise|> Omg I think I'm going to die from laughing
2632,<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit that's crazy.
2633,<|emo_surprise|> oh [NAME] I thought you hated the word fascism
2634,<|emo_surprise|> How many have I lost to accountancy?
2635,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling really a little reluctant to start over but at least now im not in the same spot i was 10 days ago
2636,<|emo_surprise|> What an amazing video. I can‚Äôt believe he hits the ground running.
2637,<|emo_surprise|> I was expecting someone to call the cops and say they saw something and that it was actually one of the kids
2638,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I'm sorry you had to go through that. I hope you're doing better now.
2639,<|emo_surprise|> The fact that you've had enough of waiting is awesome.
2640,<|emo_surprise|> What a year! We did it!
2641,<|emo_surprise|> You. I like you
2642,<|emo_surprise|> You have a much better educated and experienced team than us. Congratulations :)
2643,<|emo_surprise|> I thought about it a lot and finally decided that the best course of action was to come out. :)
2644,<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit!!!
2645,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, super glue gun. Yikes."
2646,<|emo_surprise|> There must be a story to be told on the subject. So many people think it will be easy.
2649,"<|emo_surprise|> You would think as a football fan, it'd be a little weird for me to root for a team that hasn't even played a game."
2650,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I think I see cheekbones!"
2651,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] this.
2652,"<|emo_surprise|> wow, you really missed the point"
2654,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like a weirdo for trusting this img src http twitter
2655,<|emo_surprise|> This is the cutest thing I've seen today.
2656,<|emo_surprise|> i still can t believe that i am feeling so unsure
2658,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, ‚Äúhaunted by text‚Äù. I'm glad you found it!"
2659,<|emo_surprise|> If anything we were just happy to get [NAME] back but he could have easily played more minutes if he hasn't injury been good.
2660,<|emo_surprise|> I'm shocked I didn't see more of this! I can't imagine life without her
2661,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that's quite the opposite of what I thought..."
2662,<|emo_surprise|> A surprise. But a welcome one
2663,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh man, the comments. Shit is going in the comments."
2664,<|emo_surprise|> Oh cool...
2665,<|emo_surprise|> Oh that‚Äôs lovely! I‚Äôm sending a thank you card.
2666,<|emo_surprise|> Hey [NAME]! I want to play with you at Games!
2668,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if he knows of a specific veganuary he could link to.
2669,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, my two favorite franchises are Star Wars and Angry Birds "
2670,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is a BEAST for our defense
2671,<|emo_surprise|> Ahhhhh now I know it all together
2672,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised it didn't catch fire like that
2673,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! You've journeyed far and wide for a moment like this?
2674,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, so that's what is gives this sub its value."
2675,<|emo_surprise|> i feel surprised when i see that i will get quite a bit more into them as i get older
2676,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if the dog owner will actually file a police report against the cat. The pet shop owner could be sued for damages as well.
2678,<|emo_surprise|> A surprise... A FUCK YES!!!!
2680,<|emo_surprise|> I'm shocked they haven't done a similar thing to Detroit
2681,<|emo_surprise|> Lol that's a weird way of spelling Disenchanted
2682,"<|emo_surprise|> Ah, yes my apologies."
2683,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is a little stunned... wondered what [NAME] was saying
2684,<|emo_surprise|> This is like a bad dream.
2686,<|emo_surprise|> Yikes I'm cringy already for this girl
2687,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like she is totally sincere but why is there such a blank page for her when i am in such a position
2688,"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, they are only breaking stories from here"
2689,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, who cares? I feel like everyone here just wants a little bit of attention from us."
2690,<|emo_surprise|> The man is so cool!!
2691,<|emo_surprise|> The fact that you think it's possible to find [NAME] in a porno isn't weird at all.
2692,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I didn't really notice it, thanks for the correction! "
2693,<|emo_surprise|> There's something else you should know about him too. He's married three times.
2695,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I cringed.
2696,<|emo_surprise|> I didn't know about that. Is it illegal?
2697,<|emo_surprise|> This is one of the weirdest I've seen.
2699,"<|emo_surprise|> Is that a clue, or is it a further clue that he is an idiot?"
2700,<|emo_surprise|> I didn't know this was happening
2701,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh. Oh no, my very heart!"
2702,"<|emo_surprise|> Who cares, they already gave you a free car!"
2703,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] fucking [NAME]
2704,<|emo_surprise|> This is me a lot this time of year. My eyes are hurting from how much I love it
2705,<|emo_surprise|> Oh damn it.
2706,"<|emo_surprise|> Can't stand the taste, replaced it with new label kim kardashian but it's still a poor man's kardashian"
2707,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs the weirdest thing ever
2708,"<|emo_surprise|> So....this is how many people actually believe in the supernatural? Wow, gotta be a miracle."
2709,<|emo_surprise|> Holy sh*t he sold out for that?!
2710,<|emo_surprise|> What a joke.
2711,<|emo_surprise|> i felt a bit surprised after i saw the title
2712,<|emo_surprise|> Ah. I thought I was alone
2713,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I don't know you, but ""stood up straight"" makes me happy. "
2714,<|emo_surprise|> Oh cool! I remember seeing that movie!
2715,<|emo_surprise|> This is the best news I have heard all season. How much I‚Äôm missing [NAME] is still a mystery üòÇ
2716,<|emo_surprise|> >I get a weird vibe from their reaction. Seems like it's totally fake tbh
2717,<|emo_surprise|> i can feel strange sometimes
2718,"<|emo_surprise|> Omg, and now I'm wondering who the hell that is, lol "
2719,<|emo_surprise|> Wow what a surprise...appears to be 3M
2721,<|emo_surprise|> What a fucking weird person he is
2722,<|emo_surprise|> Omg so glad your okay
2723,<|emo_surprise|> I didn‚Äôt know it said 14 ‚Äòage‚Äô
2724,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, my first comment here is a positive (and also a ""what the fuck"" but whatever)"
2725,<|emo_surprise|> A surprise to be sure
2726,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, I would have never guessed that would be the case! I‚Äôm very happy for you."
2727,<|emo_surprise|> Oh no no he didn't
2729,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs awesome news. Really made me feel for you last year...
2730,<|emo_surprise|> i feel weird saying this since i do
2731,<|emo_surprise|> My goodness! He kept saying ‚Äúwhat a baby‚Äù
2732,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I thought I was alone"
2733,<|emo_surprise|> I feel like I've just seen something amazing
2734,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh, no wonder everyone has kids."
2735,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you and the baby are lucky to be alive."
2736,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you've been a net loss in the wars that you're supporting."
2737,<|emo_surprise|> Omg yes. Was the best moment ever
2738,"<|emo_surprise|> It's weird that he seems to think Reddit has become a real ""thing"" (which might be another reason why he's unsure of proper spelling)"
2739,<|emo_surprise|> I'm confused but happy that began to turn into a full on SHUUUUUTT
2740,"<|emo_surprise|> My gosh it's actually happening. But we both heard a loud, sudden bang and the whole world went deaf..."
2741,"<|emo_surprise|> He's a bit of a quitter, but he loves football and we're lucky he's not with us."
2742,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I‚Äôm surprised they didn‚Äôt use him in the movie
2743,<|emo_surprise|> What a fuckin n
2744,<|emo_surprise|> She‚Äôs just a model citizen after all...
2745,<|emo_surprise|> It's oddly comforting to know that a president wasn't born in the US.
2746,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I wish I could have had it before my eyes.
2747,<|emo_surprise|> He finally got it!!
2748,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh no, she is using her older self, remember [NAME] "
2749,<|emo_surprise|> You can buy many used carry-on checked bags. TSA is ridiculous.
2750,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, more than 8 million likes!"
2751,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that's a big 3 year old..."
2752,<|emo_surprise|> i can feel myself getting a little overwhelmed but it s ok
2753,"<|emo_surprise|> Who are all these people, 10 feet away!"
2754,"<|emo_surprise|> What an obnoxious, drunk girl. "
2756,"<|emo_surprise|> How do you know this! He does say nice things, but it would be from memory."
2757,<|emo_surprise|> oh my [NAME] that's so creepy oh my
2758,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I've never seen such cringy old Baby [NAME] impersonations."
2759,<|emo_surprise|> And you thought they smelled bad on the outside!
2760,<|emo_surprise|> It's a joke I made up to make [NAME] mad
2761,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is a very interesting character and a great example of a human being
2762,"<|emo_surprise|> Ahhhhh, I see what you did there."
2763,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, the way he just took off is almost suspicious."
2765,"<|emo_surprise|> Omg, I just made a double entendre out of a frozen pizza using this! Yum!"
2766,"<|emo_surprise|> Who the hell believes that, actually! [NAME] gets absolutely destroyed from all the negative press he gets!"
2767,<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is just crazy
2768,<|emo_surprise|> Omg creepy!
2770,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] that sounds terrible man
2771,<|emo_surprise|> He's so damn cute!
2772,"<|emo_surprise|> Well, this is frustrating. Good riddance to awful rubbish."
2773,<|emo_surprise|> The worst is still to come!
2775,<|emo_surprise|> Omg! You‚Äôre so gorgeous! üòçüòÇ
2777,<|emo_surprise|> Oh for sure! But pleased I haven't bought into that yet. It could get a lot worse...
2778,<|emo_surprise|> What a weird thing to say. Thanks for the help though.
2779,<|emo_surprise|> i feel pretty cool
2780,<|emo_surprise|> What a strange thing to say
2782,<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs so fucking crazy that we have an ownership group lead by a former [NAME] fan.
2783,<|emo_surprise|> I think the biggest Nightmare
2785,<|emo_surprise|> Omg it looks like they're doing a 30 second spot? Omg!!!
2786,<|emo_surprise|> i feel that way all the time and i dont think im ever surprised
2787,<|emo_surprise|> Lol! What are you doing to deserve this? I‚Äôm so sorry you had to face that
2788,<|emo_surprise|> i can just feel what god is going through in there and then i feel the wonder
2789,<|emo_surprise|> Oh the horror! We must defend the honor of Lord [NAME] against the scum of r/NFL!
2791,<|emo_surprise|> How did I miss that?
2793,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised people didn't check the YouTube comments first.
2794,<|emo_surprise|> I think he should go to the league. Didn‚Äôt think he could do that in the minor league.
2795,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] I miss [NAME]
2796,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs pretty wild actually..
2798,<|emo_surprise|> i feel amazed that i can go and change anything in my mind
2799,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] this is why I love reddit!
2800,<|emo_surprise|> Damn I didn‚Äôt know your name. Never had a idea of who your real name was until you told me about it today
2801,<|emo_surprise|> i feel more and more overwhelmed
2802,<|emo_surprise|> Why? I love it
2804,<|emo_surprise|> Wow they just sold out. Be patient
2805,<|emo_surprise|> He was so calm when the guy started beating on him like it was a bug he was shocked and shaken to say the least. Amazing level of calm.
2806,"<|emo_surprise|> It's weird how much I've heard (and read) this over the past year or so. Happy for them, too."
2808,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I'm so glad this got lightening in the links because today I could have gone directly to The New York Times or Daily Wire
2809,<|emo_surprise|> The lack of a forward would be an interesting wrinkle if we end up with a forward line like last year.
2811,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if the balls got wet that quickly.
2812,<|emo_surprise|> What's your opinion on that? I'd really like to hear more if you comment.
2813,"<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if that's why most people get away with saying ""I know what it feels like to be a virgin"""
2815,<|emo_surprise|> i feel very overwhelmed with those i ve read over the last year
2816,<|emo_surprise|> You should send it to your mom to give it a whirl
2818,<|emo_surprise|> Hey! I‚Äôm on reddit! Let me know if you see him! Thanks!
2820,<|emo_surprise|> Why is it illegal to post a picture of yourself without a picture uploaded
2821,<|emo_surprise|> That's so awesome!
2822,<|emo_surprise|> Oh that's lovely. Did you experience any short term memory loss?
2823,<|emo_surprise|> The real shock is how many people didn't catch what [NAME] said when he first began talking about the club's future ownership.
2824,<|emo_surprise|> I couldn't believe [NAME] got his hands on a gun he didn't know nothing about.
2825,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] was just awesome. The dude is a legend of our industry.
2826,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is making some great plays at the rim. Love his tenacity and aggressiveness
2827,<|emo_surprise|> What an awful list
2828,<|emo_surprise|> I don't think a lot of people realize how crazy this is...
2829,<|emo_surprise|> i feel extremely helpless i feel like a third party citizen and so i try to do what i can within the system
2830,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I've said it before, he's terrible at his job and honestly does need to be more careful... "
2831,<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs shocking that such terrible people are still able to think like this.
2832,"<|emo_surprise|> wow, that's some information for a book"
2833,<|emo_surprise|> OMG kids are dying from polio??
2834,<|emo_surprise|> Wow he could hit that
2835,<|emo_surprise|> Hey! I started a Googling around and it actually results in lots of weird results
2836,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I didn't know [NAME] could do that. I mean he does have amazing strength for his weight"
2837,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, the parenthetical was more awkward than it should have been."
2838,<|emo_surprise|> OMG! You‚Äôre cool!
2839,<|emo_surprise|> Damn...I thought I was the only one.
2840,<|emo_surprise|> You have a weird way of phrasing things!
2841,<|emo_surprise|> i feel very special inside
2842,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] looks horrible
2843,"<|emo_surprise|> wow, glad they all seem to be getting their degrees in the fall instead of earlier"
2844,<|emo_surprise|> Omg did I just lose my mind LOL wow I have to read this multiple times
2845,<|emo_surprise|> Wow didn‚Äôt realize there was a name for this :(
2846,<|emo_surprise|> I am actually shocked that he thinks Reddit is some kind of an online alternative media.
2847,<|emo_surprise|> i think it may have just reminded me how much it disturbed me when i got to think about a bit more about it
2848,<|emo_surprise|> i have also seen many young women who are just so into it all at the moment and seem to have no concept of what is really sexualised is a thing
2849,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling that way aww that made me laugh
2850,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I have no idea what to say to this other than wow."
2851,<|emo_surprise|> What a sweetheart :D
2852,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling a little strange writing this post because the past few days i have been at work for a couple of days i have been away from home and i dont know if thats worth sharing
2853,<|emo_surprise|> So? I dont think he was drunk though. I think he was just nervous that theyrent going to leave him money.
2854,<|emo_surprise|> This is a good point. I wonder how bad this affected [NAME]... he got a lot of help for a while
2855,<|emo_surprise|> This is amazing!!!
2856,<|emo_surprise|> Just happened to me while using the wi-fi at an office park... LOL
2857,"<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm just going to say this, the [NAME] on this album sounds amazing."
2858,"<|emo_surprise|> There are literally 2.5M active members in this sub, why would anyone even want to be in it?"
2859,<|emo_surprise|> This is amazing!!
2860,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow that's amazing and you two have known each other for a long time. Thanks for sharing that.
2861,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling funny talking about it
2862,<|emo_surprise|> How amazing.
2863,"<|emo_surprise|> She would be devastated. Oh no, no no"
2865,<|emo_surprise|> I remember watching it once and it was amazing. Now I feel a little bit weird sharing it..
2866,<|emo_surprise|> OMG the bra hanging out of the back of that dress is freaking drool-worthy
2867,"<|emo_surprise|> Hey, y'all are being an asshat again..."
2868,<|emo_surprise|> OMG I thought you said YES
2869,<|emo_surprise|> omg i felt so damn emotional reading that
2870,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my.
2871,<|emo_surprise|> She can tell just about anything for how long... *snort*
2873,<|emo_surprise|> i feel so dazed and totally unsure
2876,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, so you actually went to Horry after all."
2877,<|emo_surprise|> wow! trust issues ü§£
2879,<|emo_surprise|> The comments on reddit haven‚Äôt helped either
2880,<|emo_surprise|> omg this is the best one ever
2881,<|emo_surprise|> That's just crazy
2882,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, hate them too."
2883,<|emo_surprise|> My heart melted omg [NAME].
2885,<|emo_surprise|> The surprise is just how much I liked the first one
2886,<|emo_surprise|> What a crazy story. I‚Äôm so glad the person telling it was able to get it through a skeptical skeptical skeptical skeptical skeptical skeptical skeptical skeptical skeptical skeptical
2887,<|emo_surprise|> Damn you are moody. It's been a shit day at the office.
2888,<|emo_surprise|> The whole thing is just... wow.
2889,"<|emo_surprise|> A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one"
2890,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, didn‚Äôt expect the final two hours"
2891,<|emo_surprise|> Hahaha I see no problem with that. I'm a little older (25) and you were not the target.
2892,"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah, and I could go on and on. That is so disgusting. "
2894,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling that sweet ooh
2895,<|emo_surprise|> The dude was dead for like....twelve fucking years!
2896,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a little weird
2897,<|emo_surprise|> You sound upset.
2899,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. The response was amazing!
2900,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] should get 2 more bbs and a bastard brooch
2901,<|emo_surprise|> Lol wow I thought the same
2902,<|emo_surprise|> omg that's gonna be a heck of a reunion as well
2904,<|emo_surprise|> i feel amazed that they can do it
2905,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, this is the first I've seen of this"
2906,<|emo_surprise|> Wow he sounds like he barely knows what he is talking about.
2908,<|emo_surprise|> i do feel that a lot of new blood is coming into the place
2910,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like i m in a strange country
2911,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that‚Äôs an interesting list
2912,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder who posted that.
2913,<|emo_surprise|> >It's always surprising how many people actually do. I * Haven't * seen any. You seem to think that being in a society with such strong social norms does things.
2914,<|emo_surprise|> The last 20 years have not been kind to oil barons but now is a very different political situation.
2915,<|emo_surprise|> i wonder why but im just feeling a little weirded out because this was something i was doing with some pretty regularity in the past few weeks
2917,<|emo_surprise|> oh god
2918,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow Thanks. I'll be sure to check this one out though
2920,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a bit shocked that i didnt find a different one
2922,<|emo_surprise|> Why do I love the mavs so much?
2923,"<|emo_surprise|> And a new favorite, ""Ouch, I thought we were getting a doubleheader."""
2924,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling pretty surprised that im still reading this because every time the last page of a book blows up on mine i feel shocked
2925,"<|emo_surprise|> I remember the very first post that got this up, and I was like wtf is this"
2926,<|emo_surprise|> oh no the poor man
2927,<|emo_surprise|> i feel so weird about this
2928,<|emo_surprise|> What a fucking moron lol.
2929,<|emo_surprise|> i hope there are a lot of people you feel overwhelmed by too
2930,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how he feels about the title change...
2931,<|emo_surprise|> i am truly shocked and feeling a little overwhelmed for what has befallen us
2932,<|emo_surprise|> What a weird way to write an article.
2933,"<|emo_surprise|> Damn. You should go to a movie theater in Dearborn, MI and see this amazing old movie called The Happening. This is about the time when everyone was talking about a dark lord coming to America"
2935,<|emo_surprise|> I'm thinking you should be. It's the most awesome story you Could ever imagine...
2936,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling doubtful lately
2937,<|emo_surprise|> Oh you mean it was *200* below normal? Sorry
2939,<|emo_surprise|> Who the hell thought he'd ever have a career beyond music lol
2940,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised they're allowed to have a website for a living.
2941,<|emo_surprise|> I remember the last time I was there it was like 2 weeks ago. Never heard of it before that.
2942,<|emo_surprise|> i feel shocked at how i felt when i read this post
2943,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a bit more stunned i think i told a story as i did before and my eyes welled up and my mouth almost fell out with excitement all i could think to say im lucky lol mpr
2944,<|emo_surprise|> i feel more and more amazed
2945,<|emo_surprise|> Ah this is scary. I hope you are doing okay.
2946,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I've only been online a month but already I've seen more posts than you!"
2947,<|emo_surprise|> OMG my two favorites üî•
2948,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. You are quite the romantic...
2949,<|emo_surprise|> And I said win what? There's no point thinking about it
2950,<|emo_surprise|> i just feel so overwhelmed lol
2951,<|emo_surprise|> There's no way they're not wrong
2952,"<|emo_surprise|> What a steal that was, the backtap was awesome."
2953,<|emo_surprise|> Really surprised he's in. Never seen theNAME so high up.
2954,"<|emo_surprise|> wow, you are quite the romantic...!"
2955,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh no, looks like she may have become pregnant"
2956,"<|emo_surprise|> I had the exact same thought, but then I checked my cell phone"
2957,"<|emo_surprise|> wow, the amount of hate [NAME] has inspired me to create these pieces is astounding"
2958,<|emo_surprise|> You are correct that the media has been extremely inaccurate in its reporting of this story.
2959,<|emo_surprise|> It doesn't surprise me given that its the parent company of the New York Times.
2960,"<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm shocked he wrote that. Keep playing him, don‚Äôt just farm him all the time. "
2961,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what happened to [NAME] after his marriage ended
2962,<|emo_surprise|> i was feeling a bit surprised that so much time had gone by since i had first set foot in the inn
2963,<|emo_surprise|> i feel really strange
2964,<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs kinda funny how that song has become a meme within the last year
2965,<|emo_surprise|> I am surprised they have to ask.
2966,<|emo_surprise|> I was surprised to see them at the grocery store. Wonder what happened?
2967,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I think I've heard before that 2% is actually a pretty high bar, so be surprised if it's that much. "
2968,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow that's great! I'm also in the area, can you recommend a couple of places I should check out?"
2969,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, the face"
2970,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, your age difference is incredibly creepy"

2979,"<|emo_surprise|> oh [NAME], dont talk about clippers"
2980,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that was fucking shocking."
2981,<|emo_surprise|> I knew this was true when he started getting weird comments on his Instagram just asking for pictures lol
2982,<|emo_surprise|> i have a feeling he wana be a terrific player
2983,<|emo_surprise|> This is a good point. I think people are shocked by the result and are very upset. This is the fault of the media too.
2984,<|emo_surprise|> Holy moly.
2985,<|emo_surprise|> i feel all startled and very surprised
2986,<|emo_surprise|> You are very welcome!
2987,<|emo_surprise|> It's amazing what people can't appreciate.
2988,"<|emo_surprise|> Omg! He lost an arm, hand, and leg to TB. I think he's still giggle"
2989,<|emo_surprise|> You are a freak
2990,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you seem like a sweet young woman."
2991,<|emo_surprise|> Omg yes feels like being new born. I still can't believe we elected this goon
2992,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh no, is that it? Sorry fell for a long time before I finally found it..."
2993,<|emo_surprise|> I had no idea that had happened. Im very very happy that no one got hurt.
2994,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] I love Meepo so much.
2995,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, I almost forgot about that episode. üòé"
2996,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if they have special powers you can use to hide stuff.
2997,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you really lucky to be in your late 30s and not doing anything aged 30+ yet"
2998,<|emo_surprise|> I'm a mom! I have two little kids and it still seems dangerous!
2999,<|emo_surprise|> Happy cake day!
3000,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if it's because they're younger.
3002,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you've been nothing but gracious to me today! "
3003,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. I had no idea! Thanks for sharing! üò¢
3004,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, I didn't know [NAME] was doing that üî•"
3005,<|emo_surprise|> How is this any different than racism? How has it ever been wrong?
3006,<|emo_surprise|> No comment. It was more of a lighthearted sarcastic comment than anything.
3007,<|emo_surprise|> What the hell?!?!?!?!?!
3008,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I can‚Äôt believe we elected this goon
3009,<|emo_surprise|> What in the actual fuck. I‚Äôm so confused.
3010,<|emo_surprise|> This is amazing.. OP just doesn‚Äôt seem right.
3011,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh ok. Never thought to check, sorry."
3012,<|emo_surprise|> I find it absolutely fascinating how little is known about this case other than what has been publicly revealed and it s absolutely astounding
3013,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you guys are lucky I did"
3014,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I know
3015,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, can you believe this? You sound like the average [NAME] mom!"
3017,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! This is going to help out a lot
3019,<|emo_surprise|> oh for sure
3021,<|emo_surprise|> OMG. I need more information on this. Is it the manager? The HR?
3022,<|emo_surprise|> Is this a real thing or just a clever joke? #4
3023,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow!!
3024,<|emo_surprise|> What if only the top 4 teams from each conference make the playoffs this year and the rest of the conference has 16? That makes it a really interesting argument
3025,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, it's safe to say I'm a ""fringe conservative"". "
3027,<|emo_surprise|> Well that's bizarre.
3029,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I didn't know. I thought they were actually making a stand but glad to hear they are still allowed to use public washrooms.
3031,"<|emo_surprise|> I wonder why they have it on their background? I mean, everyone knows the Amazon Echo is a smart speaker."
3032,<|emo_surprise|> Soooo.... He lost an arm.. How is it even possible for a man to lose an arm so horribly
3033,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I didn't know they changed the last name on their application to reflect their photo. Geez."
3034,<|emo_surprise|> My cat just attacked me for treats (and treats only) so I had him Dart up a tree!
3035,<|emo_surprise|> Omg. I think I'm gonna have a stroke right now.
3036,<|emo_surprise|> You are freaking insane
3037,<|emo_surprise|> i remember feeling a shocked and confused feeling
3038,<|emo_surprise|> Wow theyre finally admitting they are a hate sub
3039,<|emo_surprise|> i feel surprised if i think i will be able to afford one
3040,<|emo_surprise|> This guy has a very interesting take on everything.
3041,"<|emo_surprise|> What's the source? I've seen this before. I'm just wondering if that guy or that meme is ""true""."
3042,"<|emo_surprise|> wow, you must've never been in Sydney, by the way."
3043,<|emo_surprise|> I think that made sense because they actually don't have to pay for anything.
3044,<|emo_surprise|> Wow 8 people in 90 minutes. Not terrible at all.
3045,<|emo_surprise|> Hahaha it's funny what people say
3046,<|emo_surprise|> Oh boy.
3047,<|emo_surprise|> I have watched this game twice now and it really is a fascinating read.
3048,<|emo_surprise|> That looks like a dream.
3049,<|emo_surprise|> This is the scariest thing I've seen so far this week. I'm just gonna have to stay and listen to it.
3051,<|emo_surprise|> You're so amazing
3052,<|emo_surprise|> i didnt feel overwhelmed by it its amazing to do new things as a kid
3053,<|emo_surprise|> Happy new year everyone!
3054,<|emo_surprise|> Wow 8 years at 18 wow
3055,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that's amazing! What a story. I love local business."
3056,<|emo_surprise|> This video has creepy old people who say they are 40 years old OMG these are some seriously old people
3057,<|emo_surprise|> i feel weird
3058,<|emo_surprise|> Ynn that game hurt.
3059,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I am glad you like her. Maybe not, but she is a talented writer. "
3060,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what that was ‚Äúairport line up‚Äù like?
3061,"<|emo_surprise|> There's always a chance the No. 1 pick would go the extra mile, but this is incredibly unlikely."
3062,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised you didn't catch the ex-fianc's name
3063,"<|emo_surprise|> I am shocked that her question was not ""if"" but ""when""! She would have asked the exact same thing in May."
3064,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, a dude named [NAME] has become like a meme..."
3065,<|emo_surprise|> i start to feel a bit overwhelmed
3066,<|emo_surprise|> He's going to be a great president and will make the world a better place. Congratulations! We will all be better off.
3067,<|emo_surprise|> Well that was unexpected
3068,<|emo_surprise|> That sounds amazing. Never heard of contesting your age
3069,<|emo_surprise|> That's a new one I've seen
3070,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I‚Äôve never seen that one. I‚Äôd be surprised if it ran.
3071,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] you got him oh my [NAME] oh my [NAME]
3072,<|emo_surprise|> How weird! I‚Äôd be surprised if she has a husband..
3073,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like she was too gullible and i liked her a bit too much for that
3074,<|emo_surprise|> What a horrible list
3075,<|emo_surprise|> I feel like calling the police...
3076,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, you're funny, you're funny"
3077,<|emo_surprise|> Wow what a weird guy.
3078,"<|emo_surprise|> If he does win it will be in the hands of a racist, sexist, anti-Semite like [NAME]."
3080,<|emo_surprise|> What a wonderful post. Thank you. I'm sorry it happened like that to you!
3081,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, never heard of that! What a great story!"
3082,<|emo_surprise|> i guess im too impatient to wait for a man who hasnt kissed me and im just feeling weird
3083,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] this woman is horrible
3084,"<|emo_surprise|> My god, [NAME]!"
3085,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, that show is actually doing really well! ü§£"
3086,<|emo_surprise|> Oh boy!
3087,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that was beautiful."
3088,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised [NAME] let her post that.
3091,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] you made me lol I love it
3092,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh man, I hope she‚Äôs alright. He really was heartless"
3093,<|emo_surprise|> I was honestly surprised he didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúoh you‚Äôre so cool‚Äù
3094,<|emo_surprise|> I mean I‚Äôd be weirded out even thinking those are the two worst songs of all time by [NAME]
3095,<|emo_surprise|> Hahahahaha! I've never heard of such a thing! üòí
3098,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, what a crazy and diverse country!"
3099,<|emo_surprise|> What the fuck was that pass. That was brutal.
3100,<|emo_surprise|> I mean I‚Äôm shocked we haven‚Äôt seen that coming
3101,<|emo_surprise|> Oh boy that‚Äôs a new one
3102,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that was dirty. Gave me so many ideas that I still didn't have thoughts on sharing. "
3104,<|emo_surprise|> Damn how do we know this?
3105,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, you guys have a body language now?"
3106,<|emo_surprise|> i feel the earth move with curious trepidation
3107,"<|emo_surprise|> So this is how it works? Everyone hates you, then one guy leaves you messages..."
3108,<|emo_surprise|> Oh lord! I thought my entire family was these amazingly terrifying things!
3109,<|emo_surprise|> The only way I know [NAME] would have said that is if he was drunk.
3110,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I don‚Äôt know what I expected from a skeptical Reddit rant.
3111,<|emo_surprise|> The only difference between [NAME] and [NAME] is the hair.
3112,<|emo_surprise|> I just thought of Weird Al and I thought about how his stand up makes me cringe
3113,<|emo_surprise|> i feel funny just joking
3114,<|emo_surprise|> And a new shirt made for her new job. Nice üé∂
3117,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh no, you‚Äôre pregnant"
3118,<|emo_surprise|> oh [NAME] how awful the last day was
3119,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh this girl is 20 years old and I would be surprised if she didn't at least 1 year out of high school.
3120,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what his relationship is like? [NAME] and [NAME] would be a good couple.
3122,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] this is talented...
3123,<|emo_surprise|> It's so damn weird
3124,<|emo_surprise|> What a fucking cunt
3125,<|emo_surprise|> i dont feel surprised though
3126,<|emo_surprise|> i feel dazed and confused at times
3127,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] this episode is terrible...
3128,"<|emo_surprise|> I have no idea what we are talking about, is there a good reference given in the article?"
3129,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, my [NAME]. You lost my follow-up comment. How awful. Well, I‚Äôm just going to have to assume you‚Äôre a moron."
3131,<|emo_surprise|> i feel very apprehensive
3132,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, so it turned out that [NAME] really isn't that bad? "
3134,<|emo_surprise|> i feel amazed about him
3135,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I actually had no idea we had a sub for horror!! Amazing
3136,"<|emo_surprise|> What a fucking autist, that's all she wrote. Fuck her. "
3137,<|emo_surprise|> A surprise turn out the lights at night.
3138,<|emo_surprise|> i was watching it this morning and at one point i thought i saw a little kid who was watching the adults but hes head was a lot bigger
3139,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm shocked everyone thinks [NAME] is that good of a swimmer...
3140,<|emo_surprise|> That movie was a smash. raptors
3141,<|emo_surprise|> It's not like [NAME] doesn't speak three languages...
3142,"<|emo_surprise|> This actually sounds like cyberpunk slang to me, I would be so pissed if I were a cyberpunk."
3143,"<|emo_surprise|> He is a bit of a loner, I wouldn't be surprised if he keeps to himself."
3144,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I wonder what grade school I had to go to to be admitted to this school...
3146,<|emo_surprise|> i have a feeling i might be surprised
3147,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I can feel your pain
3148,<|emo_surprise|> Oh that's lovely.
3149,<|emo_surprise|> i feel amazed
3151,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised there‚Äôs a sub for this
3152,<|emo_surprise|> i feel in my heart that i should do them for the love of god only
3156,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm shocked. I mean, we had five point guards last season, so it's not like they're suddenly bad."
3157,<|emo_surprise|> I can do this! I live for this thread
3158,"<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what that Feudalism is, did he become Feudalism because he was Feudal, or because he realized Feudaling is Feudalism?"
3159,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, the number of kids that think this is cute is fascinating."
3161,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder where it goes after that!
3162,<|emo_surprise|> Is this [NAME] time to worry? His starting 11 was absolutely awful...he played a lot of minutes on both ends of the floor
3163,<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe we elected this goon
3164,<|emo_surprise|> I had a feeling he was going to say that.
3166,<|emo_surprise|> It's just a joke. I am actually interested in the evidence of whether or not that's true as a political scientist and so on
3167,<|emo_surprise|> I have a feeling he didn't say all of that just so I could tell how much I was rooting for him...
3168,<|emo_surprise|> *OwO]
3169,<|emo_surprise|> There was a moment in the video when the drone went flying off the end dishes.
3170,<|emo_surprise|> i have a feeling i could never really become that amazing about music because i cant see the road and thats what makes it so special
3171,<|emo_surprise|> > Wow you're an hour north of me
3172,<|emo_surprise|> He's been a little more indecisive lately though.
3173,<|emo_surprise|> oh man another year
3174,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, I didn't even know this existed!"
3175,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] I thought all of our posts were in a single post?! We‚Äòre so awesome!
3176,<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs been like a month now since I put anything positive on here. That‚Äôs good.
3178,<|emo_surprise|> You're a monster
3182,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, never seen a more eloquent and convincing presentation of the ""I have no opinion"" argument ever"
3184,<|emo_surprise|> Oh no that's horrible omg
3185,<|emo_surprise|> Yikes. How do you post something directly to the front page? I guess if you don‚Äôt do something good enough then not valuable at all.
3187,"<|emo_surprise|> No wonder the financial crisis is blamed on ""bad"" mortgage backed securities. Sounds familiar"
3188,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Noted
3189,<|emo_surprise|> i feel this strange sense of wanting so extremely much
3190,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling fairly overwhelmed right now but i am slowly starting to realize that i could be making some big changes in my life in about a month
3191,<|emo_surprise|> I can imagine. He could totally blow up at any time
3192,<|emo_surprise|> i was feeling really anxious
3194,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling surprised that people are saying that
3195,<|emo_surprise|> WTH? Just another afternoon of [NAME] on the floor
3196,<|emo_surprise|> Why is this still not banned
3197,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] and [NAME] were playing for the defending champs and it looked like one of the worst possible starts I've ever seen.
3198,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh look, it's *reshaped*!"
3199,<|emo_surprise|> OMG my heart!
3200,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised the suspect didn't run away
3201,<|emo_surprise|> i guess i m feeling a little bit overwhelmed but i know it s alright
3202,"<|emo_surprise|> Can't believe it took this long. I'm a little envious, though. I need to watch it a lot."
3203,<|emo_surprise|> How does it feel to win the Superbowl over the Giants so handily and end up missing a field goal
3204,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I would be really surprised if he played for less than 5 years. I'm a bit of a [NAME] type fan. I wish he kept playing for us.
3205,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, how awful."
3206,<|emo_surprise|> i think youre going to be surprised at who i end up with and just how deeply i ve accepted myself and where ive come from
3207,<|emo_surprise|> They‚Äôre all horrible
3208,<|emo_surprise|> Omg this is the best!
3209,<|emo_surprise|> I'm shocked she didn't name him [NAME].
3210,"<|emo_surprise|> Can't stand him, but he's funny AF in this movie"
3211,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, I didn't know that the term ""centrist"" had been around for so long."
3212,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, the lack of women in your subreddit is astounding."
3213,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow this is some good shit
3214,<|emo_surprise|> What? Didn't grow up with him?
3215,<|emo_surprise|> Omg i remember that! So cringe aware
3216,<|emo_surprise|> Wow 5 downvotes in 3 minutes. You have an adventure.
3217,"<|emo_surprise|> oh, oh no"
3218,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] looks more handsome in person.
3219,<|emo_surprise|> im not feeling very artistic or creative
3220,<|emo_surprise|> I never heard of that before
3221,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling so overwhelmed
3222,<|emo_surprise|> i feel really surprised that i have friends with this name
3223,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling really skeptical about the whole almond milk thing
3224,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is killing it in Raleigh. It could be the next four years
3226,<|emo_surprise|> i didnt feel very special but i liked him a lot
3227,<|emo_surprise|> I thought he was just a little dude!
3228,<|emo_surprise|> It was a really fun game. We defeated them handily.
3229,<|emo_surprise|> I can‚Äôt believe the Chargers lost to the Patriots in furious fashion. My god.
3231,<|emo_surprise|> That poor janitor.
3232,<|emo_surprise|> i think its important to hear these brave and curious stories
3233,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is just a guy who hates fags
3234,<|emo_surprise|> This actually made me laugh out loud.
3235,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, this is the first I've heard of him aligning with a fascist."
3236,<|emo_surprise|> The only thing less terrible than this is him actually owning a gun
3237,<|emo_surprise|> Is there any way to delete cookies on mobile? My problem is that I can't delete cookies on desktop.
3239,<|emo_surprise|> Really wow. I hope you make out well moved forward. Stay strong. Love you.
3241,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh what a recovery
3242,<|emo_surprise|> She's only 34
3243,<|emo_surprise|> Soooooo yes. I don't know why but I literally started laughing when [NAME] said that!
3244,<|emo_surprise|> Damn you! I thought I knew the identity of all the people on the internet! I'm so happy to know you all!
3245,<|emo_surprise|> Oh geez.
3246,<|emo_surprise|> The weirdest part is he's almost entirely unidentifiable....
3248,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder where the gun parts are.
3249,<|emo_surprise|> I was there the second week. It was horrible. I loved being a kid.
3250,<|emo_surprise|> How are you sure that the woman on her phone isn't reading all of's comments?
3251,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, my heart!"
3252,"<|emo_surprise|> Wtf? Really? I am new here, what's the point of this?"
3253,<|emo_surprise|> You. I think. I'm impressed.
3254,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] I didn't even think of that
3255,<|emo_surprise|> Lol. You just posted the dumbest thing I've ever said on here. Thanks for sharing. This is how it worksta groh
3256,<|emo_surprise|> >It's weird because it's exactly what people who hate on [RELIGION] do
3257,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh! I only saw the second half on YouTube, but this is so spot on!"
3258,<|emo_surprise|> Lmao I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre saying this
3259,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling very unsure about my career
3260,<|emo_surprise|> OMG. I've never seen so many deleted comments.
3261,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! We‚Äôve been hearing a lot lately about why she lost to [NAME]
3262,<|emo_surprise|> Holy crap that's actually funny. Is there any way to export this as CSV?
3263,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wait. Was that the other guy on the other side?!
3264,<|emo_surprise|> i always feel amazed how people can change completely
3265,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, this is the first time I‚Äôve seen this."
3268,<|emo_surprise|> i was shocked and feel very dumb
3269,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like im more of a girl then ive ever been
3270,<|emo_surprise|> The way she just kept pressing was extremely uncomfortable.
3271,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] I was expecting a much worse ""oh my [NAME]"""
3272,<|emo_surprise|> What a surprise i had not seen this either on here or on Baidu search. Good job!
3273,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I have found my calling
3274,<|emo_surprise|> The other day was the first real time I've ever sat in a car without a seatbelt. So much worse than the situation I was in back in 2005.
3275,<|emo_surprise|> Wow your mom actually did something right
3276,"<|emo_surprise|> wow, you're actually quite shocked to hear this though right"
3277,<|emo_surprise|> This was amazing.
3278,<|emo_surprise|> Omg I couldn't words describe how I felt watching that
3279,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling extremely reluctant to leave
3280,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling a little overwhelmed feeling like i dont have anything right now
3281,<|emo_surprise|> i actually feel impressed
3283,"<|emo_surprise|> They‚Äôre saying you‚Äôre a violent racist now, dude."
3284,<|emo_surprise|> What a fucking cuck
3285,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME]...
3286,"<|emo_surprise|> Just saw that, is live Another terrific interview!"
3287,<|emo_surprise|> Wow it was more votes than [NAME]
3288,<|emo_surprise|> Oi he got stabbed in the eye
3289,<|emo_surprise|> i didnt feel surprised
3290,"<|emo_surprise|> Lol that's so true, I‚Äôm surprised they still use it though."
3291,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a little surprised and confused
3292,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my wow. And it's off the coast of Florida
3293,<|emo_surprise|> i felt very amazed at the change in me
3294,<|emo_surprise|> i think i am pretty impressed with myself though
3295,<|emo_surprise|> The comment was so terrible. I literally blanked.
3297,<|emo_surprise|> This is why [NAME] can't be president.
3298,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] it‚Äôs [NAME] it made me laugh
3299,<|emo_surprise|> Woot oh yaaassss.
3301,<|emo_surprise|> How is it racist? It is pretty clear that he is ignorant and racist.
3302,<|emo_surprise|> Yeah I was thinking the same. I was wondering what went into it
3303,<|emo_surprise|> Why aren't you a [NAME] fanboy?
3304,<|emo_surprise|> Ah the high life...
3305,<|emo_surprise|> What? [NAME] was terrible during the regular season
3306,<|emo_surprise|> I think [NAME] just was too much
3307,"<|emo_surprise|> Ahhh, I've gotcha!"
3308,<|emo_surprise|> i can get a taste of the taste of the actual product im excited even though i dont know it is prepared in that way i feel like a dineee
3309,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow he actually said this?!
3310,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, that is some good karma"
3311,<|emo_surprise|> Who‚Äôs surprised he didn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy you‚Äù
3313,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is so cool
3314,<|emo_surprise|> And there you have it. The problem with the left is it doesn't really support anything.
3315,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like a freak in every way
3316,<|emo_surprise|> i could feel myself getting the sense i was about to be tortured by this
3317,<|emo_surprise|> What's the cringe?
3318,<|emo_surprise|> The fuck? Is this the new horror show from NoSleep?
3320,<|emo_surprise|> You need to buy one!
3321,"<|emo_surprise|> Hey, cool thanks!"
3322,"<|emo_surprise|> I think about it, there are quite a few people who would be keen to have an explainatory video about it."
3323,<|emo_surprise|> I had no idea that a sub had existed until I looked.
3324,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, they're so wrong on so many levels! Thank you for giving me some comfort and calm in the last hours. I'm so sorry for the whole situation!"
3325,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow thanks, i never knew about this! I was wondering what happened?"
3326,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, what a surprise i never saw coming"
3327,<|emo_surprise|> There is so much going on behind the scenes in that episode that i wonder if the showrunners ever tried to keep it real.
3328,<|emo_surprise|> He‚Äôs actually been a pro hockey player for 14 years...I‚Äôm shocked he‚Äôs a teacher.
3329,<|emo_surprise|> Yeah I thought this was a place to add something new and different. Well thank you very much i am just now realizing the amount of hate you haveors got behind you. You were the bad guys.
3330,<|emo_surprise|> What a steal that pick was
3331,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that's pretty unexpected actually. What can you expect?"
3332,<|emo_surprise|> Lol I can‚Äôt believe [NAME] does it
3333,<|emo_surprise|> Damn. I have seen plenty of ppl complain about [NAME] but for a top 20 this is fucking shocking
3335,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what the dress code situation is at Uptown.
3336,<|emo_surprise|> The amount of [RELIGION] in that statement...I can't believe it's that big of a problem for society.
3337,"<|emo_surprise|> This is insane. I feel for the kids, money is no object. "
3339,<|emo_surprise|> Wow i‚Äôm seeing now
3340,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I have never seen a more disgusted andinformative response to a question in my life.
3341,<|emo_surprise|> I can hear the boots clanging over the phone at work.
3342,<|emo_surprise|> Wow you‚Äôre so cool! Looks like you‚Äôre going to love college too!
3344,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a little surprised that he actually did
3345,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I knew him. He has been in many different media.
3346,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, I'm so sorry. That poor snake."
3347,<|emo_surprise|> Wow... Just Wow
3348,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I felt my heart drop."
3349,<|emo_surprise|> wow I felt you. thanks for sharing.
3350,<|emo_surprise|> i remember feeling weird and strange because i had such a hard time putting my finger on my nose for several minutes
3351,<|emo_surprise|> I'm literally screaming.
3352,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, the cop said you hit two innocent people, what a fucking idiot."
3353,<|emo_surprise|> oh [NAME] i forgot about that! i was actually going to tell you this just in case this turns out to be a fucking joke
3354,<|emo_surprise|> I actually liked the new fatalities. Was that a copypasta?
3355,<|emo_surprise|> i feel more interested in this
3356,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling fairly doubtful that this will ever be truly resolved
3357,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôve been catching and loving this one since it first came out
3358,<|emo_surprise|> You're a weirdo.
3359,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised the government isn't doing something about this already.
3360,<|emo_surprise|> i just think maybe she was feeling a little overwhelmed
3361,<|emo_surprise|> > But it is uncertain if this has to do with your personal financial situation. Which is completely beside the point
3362,<|emo_surprise|> The fuck? I thought he was calling his mom about his dad spending too much of his Christmas money and not sending her gifts...
3363,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Your sister's boyfriend called the police on your mom for threatening to hurt your sisters...
3364,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]! You should come try out for the L5 team!!
3366,<|emo_surprise|> Ohhhhh my gosh i saw that there was a sub forgers
3368,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that's just some of the bullshit passed off by those idiots!"
3369,<|emo_surprise|> i feel so impressed with every bit of my brain that its working
3370,<|emo_surprise|> The first picture with him is of what is left of his beard... looks like it was years ago
3371,<|emo_surprise|> I get nervous just reading your flair
3372,<|emo_surprise|> Damn you!
3373,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like life is sort of blank
3374,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I'm sorry, but did anyone reply to you?"
3376,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling a bit of wonder woman
3377,<|emo_surprise|> She seems like a very nice and studious 15 year old that is very curious about the world. She impressed me quite a bit with her questioning and studying abilities.
3378,"<|emo_surprise|> It's a weird thing to be true, though."
3379,<|emo_surprise|> wow what a nightmare
3380,<|emo_surprise|> i feel in my left hand something precious something inside me that is so precious
3383,<|emo_surprise|> Ah yeah.
3385,<|emo_surprise|> This is the first time I‚Äôm hearing this.
3386,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is also going to hit his stride. I'm expecting him to hit over 100 d it's all going to come together for him 
3387,<|emo_surprise|> i want to say something but i m feeling a little bit weird because i dont have a lot to say
3388,<|emo_surprise|> Omg. I have been thinking about these too. What else can I do to help them? 
3389,<|emo_surprise|> My wife and I got engaged over a year ago and she's become our second officer in her company. It has been an amazing 5 years.
3391,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, I thought all my questions were about this episode..."
3392,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, congratulations :D"
3393,<|emo_surprise|> The weird eyes. I really don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre looking at.
3394,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs the cutest thing I‚Äôve ever seen on a man
3395,<|emo_surprise|> Lol what a surprise i hardly knew existed
3396,<|emo_surprise|> >he took his wife's wedding ring What *hell*
3397,<|emo_surprise|> How very comforting.
3398,<|emo_surprise|> I don‚Äôt know if you are but I absolutely LOVE your cover art at this point
3399,<|emo_surprise|> That's... pretty unexpected actually.
3400,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, the horror..."
3401,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I can‚Äôt believe people still fall victims to that system.
3402,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised he didn't say it was [NAME] and [NAME].
3403,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised she passed the English language questions with flying colors
3404,<|emo_surprise|> I'm afraid to look.
3405,<|emo_surprise|> How do ya feel about [NAME] being in your background?
3407,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Didn't know [NAME] could sing.
3408,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] I felt you.
3409,<|emo_surprise|> You think I was being sarcastic about the fact that I think they‚Äôre all pretty terrible?
3410,<|emo_surprise|> i feel amazed at what i have been learning
3411,<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs a weird thing to be excited for. It could be a great thing
3412,<|emo_surprise|> Well this is strange.
3414,<|emo_surprise|> Lol!!!
3415,<|emo_surprise|> oh what
3416,<|emo_surprise|> Damn.
3417,"<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if that's why it's so hard for people to accept transgender people. They're usually assumed to be strong, beautiful and intelligent."
3418,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I don't know what to say."
3419,<|emo_surprise|> Really amazed there is still room for improvement though.
3420,<|emo_surprise|> i wonder if they feel anything just wondering
3422,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm about to die right nowüòéüòéüòéüòç
3423,<|emo_surprise|> Oh yeah?
3424,<|emo_surprise|> Wow.. Sounds like you have a lot of people who really dont know much about politics yet who like your YouTube
3425,<|emo_surprise|> Omg no way I live there
3426,<|emo_surprise|> I was freaking out watching this. What??
3428,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]! Where the hell is that damn business card?!
3429,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I'm glad I grew up in the U
3430,<|emo_surprise|> Lol!
3431,<|emo_surprise|> This is oddly specific. I might actually be interested in it.
3432,"<|emo_surprise|> I've found that these kinds of comments don't always leave the sub, but they're more active when they do."
3433,<|emo_surprise|> Can't believe he just used 4 words that reference his religion. Wonder how high [NAME] will sink.
3434,<|emo_surprise|> How scary!
3435,<|emo_surprise|> i am going to be truthful with you and say that i can t be totally certain because it happened so suddenly
3436,<|emo_surprise|> Damn that's cute
3437,"<|emo_surprise|> Ah, victory "
3438,<|emo_surprise|> He was good to us this year... we could have easily won the cup
3439,"<|emo_surprise|> Well that's certainly a shock to be sure, but it's better than nothing!"
3441,<|emo_surprise|> What a fucking cuck!
3442,<|emo_surprise|> i wonder though when im feeling uncertain
3443,<|emo_surprise|> So did mine! And it was the best birthday gift ever!
3444,<|emo_surprise|> i feel the first step is to get it over with so i can move on to more productive things with my life
3446,<|emo_surprise|> What a weird thing to say
3447,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, oh! I didn't even think of that haha"
3448,<|emo_surprise|> I do so love my state sometimes. But this just is not one of them.
3449,<|emo_surprise|> What? That's a fucking looooooong time ago
3450,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Don't live in a bubble then.
3451,<|emo_surprise|> This is one of the top 5 most infuriating YouTube comments I've seen all month.
3452,<|emo_surprise|> Oh yesssss I'm so lucky! üíï
3453,<|emo_surprise|> Omg I just read the entire thing and it makes my hair bleed
3454,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! What a steal that was
3456,<|emo_surprise|> Damn I‚Äôm old
3458,<|emo_surprise|> What a weird thing to say. I love the weirdness
3459,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you think he actually went to that? Because it's more like he went to see a movie or something"
3460,<|emo_surprise|> Thats definitely something
3461,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, gosh! I see it now!"
3463,<|emo_surprise|> Yeah the last week of May was amazing.
3464,<|emo_surprise|> i don t know how i could have written it more naturally but wow what a gorgeous message this is to me
3465,<|emo_surprise|> That's a fucking mason jar full of shite!
3466,<|emo_surprise|> i feel curious and excited but just wonder
3467,<|emo_surprise|> I'm also shocked there isn't more of a community around this.
3468,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised he didn't say something like that to the kid, especially since it was so incredibly cringy."
3469,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, hate that we don't get to see more of her."
3470,<|emo_surprise|> There's nothing more frustrating than a situation where you didn't react the way you should have. This is one of the reasons I become an event attendee. *shudders at how easily this happens*
3472,<|emo_surprise|> She did mention a crazy expensive jewelry line she used to own..
3473,<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is a thing? Thanks!
3475,<|emo_surprise|> i was going to try this and be honest i am feeling pretty skeptical and not very well but then i thought about this
3476,<|emo_surprise|> i can take and leave and feel amazing
3477,<|emo_surprise|> That's one way to teach a bay is a bay
3478,"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah, the way he wrote it was really weird"
3479,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] has a strange sense of humor.
3480,"<|emo_surprise|> oh i get an animation saying ""the ground is level"" and then a falling tree into it then that's strange"
3482,<|emo_surprise|> And that other man with that bag of mayo?! RIGGED!
3483,<|emo_surprise|> Damn you're right!
3484,<|emo_surprise|> There was a horrific accident
3485,<|emo_surprise|> I've seen before that this is the most times my ex-girlfriend goes out with her friends and has no idea...
3486,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I just discovered her today too! I really like her!
3487,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm wondering if that was a new Reddit account that I missed
3488,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I bet ya won't mind if I use my real name on here justin xerner xerner
3489,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is on fire!!!
3490,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised [NAME] lets her have porn.
3491,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I mean really wow.
3493,<|emo_surprise|> i just want to scream and scream and scream
3494,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh! You didn't even realize you were talking about me!
3495,<|emo_surprise|> Yup that would have definitely shaken his confidence a bit
3497,<|emo_surprise|> I think my favorite part of the whole thread is the new background art. What a nightmare.
3499,<|emo_surprise|> Whoa that's really cool. Thanks AO
3500,<|emo_surprise|> It's not like we don't have other amazing options. Just not in the metropolitan area I'm hearing this is.
3501,<|emo_surprise|> Oh is that it
3502,<|emo_surprise|> Lol! Wonder if we'll ever see a real Take That.
3504,<|emo_surprise|> What do I call someone who hasn't seen his or her share? Kids are a strange breed üòÇ
3505,<|emo_surprise|> *giggle* I was literally making fun of just how ridiculously high that bar was.
3506,"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah, you're right. I've been trying to be more likeable on it but haven't been a huge problem. "
3507,<|emo_surprise|> oh [NAME] how terrible
3508,<|emo_surprise|> Wow did not know [NAME] was in the league that long
3509,<|emo_surprise|> My favourite gusgasm
3510,<|emo_surprise|> What does it look like? I'm a little surprised they haven't done it already.
3511,<|emo_surprise|> Oh the horror. Have you never seen [NAME]? She has a couple of them. Weird! Maybe [NAME] would creep you out.
3512,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh no, what now?"
3513,<|emo_surprise|> i went to visit the pagetitle was curious what it was about his presentation and i was surprised he went into such detail as to describe the story of the rise of his family and particularly his brother who he feels is the real hero
3514,<|emo_surprise|> It is a very dangerous game to keep track of someone's financial interests
3517,"<|emo_surprise|> Whoa, ok now I'm wondering what happened"
3518,<|emo_surprise|> i don t ever feel weird or uncomfortable with how i dress
3519,"<|emo_surprise|> omg, that's the only thing that came to mind for me! thank you! its lovely to have a friend of which to turn again!"
3521,<|emo_surprise|> The saddest part is that [NAME] is a college student.
3522,<|emo_surprise|> > it's amazing how much I love the show haha
3523,<|emo_surprise|> I see [NAME] but wonder if they have his eye holes figured out yet
3524,<|emo_surprise|> Omg so glad this post made you stop reading. Wtf is reddit?
3525,<|emo_surprise|> Omg this is so creepy. Wtf is that.
3526,<|emo_surprise|> i thought i was just a guy but guess i m a weirdo
3527,<|emo_surprise|> i can remember feeling this strange feeling i could hear only the little squeak of the squeak tube radio
3528,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs a nice-ish haird
3529,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my that
3530,<|emo_surprise|> i feel shocked i feel dazed i feel stunned i feel shocked
3531,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs pretty wild.
3533,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, now I am sad"
3534,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I remember reading that article. I'm pretty shocked I didn't realise I'd join in.
3535,<|emo_surprise|> OMG it's SO HARD to get your hands on a 3D printer!
3536,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised [NAME] hasn't been made GM
3537,<|emo_surprise|> Damn who got the bad end?
3538,<|emo_surprise|> You‚Äôre doing you mama a favor. Maybe that‚Äôs worth learning a lesson about.
3539,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my. Oh my gosh
3541,<|emo_surprise|> Wow... I've been catching and loving these. It's hard to pick just one though...
3542,<|emo_surprise|> Hahaha i agree. But what‚Äôs a surprise is it that nobody thought of that in the planning.
3543,<|emo_surprise|> wow so you really are pro-abuse huh
3544,<|emo_surprise|> Oh! You‚Äôre back!!!
3545,<|emo_surprise|> It's a matter of life and death for him to not be the first choice for starting this. I think it's more of a show where there is a split or not so split than just a decision
3547,<|emo_surprise|> Oh no the poor nag. Go play Angry Birds Go or something.
3548,<|emo_surprise|> i don t feel i can write about this without feeling kind of weird
3549,<|emo_surprise|> Oh god it‚ÄôsÔøΩm the same rick he‚Äôs been talking about since the start of the year
3551,<|emo_surprise|> > The whole party has suddenly become a cult. WHAT?!
3552,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is so valuable as a DB....
3553,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, now I am wondering what they are suppose to sound like..."
3554,<|emo_surprise|> I've never heard of a situation like this. I'm glad you and the young woman are safe.
3555,<|emo_surprise|> Omg I just finished and I am SHOOK! üí≠
3556,<|emo_surprise|> I was wondering if any of you guys had this book! I'm afraid I'll have to check it out some day.
3557,"<|emo_surprise|> I think [NAME] is going to back his wife and kids, but it's not because she's a [NAME]."
3558,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Did not expect this thread to go this long. Thanks for the points. So happy this all came out
3559,<|emo_surprise|> Hmhmm
3560,"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, that was deep."
3561,<|emo_surprise|> Wow your creepy
3563,<|emo_surprise|> I have no idea what that is but thanks
3564,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] why you crying on /r/cringe /u/Rising_Up_The_Forgetfulness
3565,<|emo_surprise|> i know youre probably not a medical doctor but i wonder how someone can be so stupid and also believe in science lol but im just wondering if there's any way that
3566,<|emo_surprise|> Wow [NAME] actually got into politics to hurt people..
3567,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. I didn‚Äôt even see that coming
3568,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow I‚Äôm just gonna check this link out for myself, it‚Äôs actually pretty interesting"
3569,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you've truly spent an afternoon Googling ""fire makeover"" and ""trendy"" and ""sexy"" and ""hacker"" and this is what you came up with. ü•Ç"
3571,<|emo_surprise|> i still feel amazed by the number of doctors who read these books
3572,<|emo_surprise|> i thought i was going crazy after this episode but i really want to see the whole thing cause he seems amazing
3573,<|emo_surprise|> > How dare you? What an entitled little shit.
3574,<|emo_surprise|> OMG! I thought about it in the DAA meeting but I'm not quite sure I'd recommend it!
3575,<|emo_surprise|> i feel amazed how easily my feelings regarding the matter have been accepted
3576,<|emo_surprise|> How is it racist? Are all those statements about all the good things [NAME] didnt mention in their original statement?
3577,"<|emo_surprise|> I read [NAME] about a week ago and thought this was pretty cool - except for the ""haha no no kajaha no"" thing."
3578,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised you called your ex that. Seems weird, especially since they are on a date together."
3579,<|emo_surprise|> If you ever decide to travel to the US you should definitely consider this
3580,<|emo_surprise|> Thanks I couldn't help but chuckle when I first saw this.
3581,<|emo_surprise|> I was wondering what [NAME] was doing in the background. I‚Äôm guessing something along the lines of ‚Äúhe went to jail but now he‚Äôs free.‚Äù
3582,<|emo_surprise|> i feel curious about it
3583,<|emo_surprise|> > And I'm wondering if you're trolling because you're not familiar with the meaning of what I just said.
3585,"<|emo_surprise|> So, you're a man hating racist?"
3586,"<|emo_surprise|> Damnit, [NAME]!"
3587,<|emo_surprise|> I thought this was the best post I've ever read on Reddit. The photos are there and relatable.
3588,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that‚Äôs a burden, I‚Äôm sorry."
3589,<|emo_surprise|> My surprise too. He's 40
3590,<|emo_surprise|> I know! I would get freaking calls if I put the word ‚Äúmanginia‚Äù in my post.
3591,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what would happen if [NAME] tried to get him to trade all his shit.
3593,<|emo_surprise|> Omg yes. In Canada too! Lol
3594,<|emo_surprise|> i get on here and i just feel really amazed by your success
3595,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME], you beat me to this!"
3596,<|emo_surprise|> My mom has had the same exact experience and it's actually quite common for people to be like that too. 
3597,<|emo_surprise|> Wow thanks so much for the note. That's really good to hear. The worst is when those moments pop up while reading a blog post. üò¢
3598,<|emo_surprise|> What a find! Very nice indeed.
3599,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, how can you say that? He was terrible all game but played like it"
3600,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, that sucks, I expected them to be much better than this!"
3601,<|emo_surprise|> i can remember feeling amazed just watching the second episode
3602,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you got the name right!"
3603,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised Reddit never got into gaming with the ban on the r/television subreddit
3604,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] no it was me!
3605,<|emo_surprise|> *lo and behold metroid
3607,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, I was expecting a horrifically broken ankle."
3608,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, glad I came across your story."
3609,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] oh my [NAME] just go inside him and out
3610,<|emo_surprise|> > a href http > http mhkaha href > http img src http img src http img src
3611,<|emo_surprise|> OMG there's a twist!
3612,<|emo_surprise|> i feel confused and wondering
3613,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I thought it was just a joke then it grew on me
3614,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh! Where did I leave that hat when I went?
3615,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME], just read your flair "
3616,<|emo_surprise|> Omg she had a pretty amazing lipsync!
3617,<|emo_surprise|> I always wondered what happened when he fell. Maybe some flashbacks from his childhood
3618,<|emo_surprise|> I do not like him and I never will. Sorry you had to deal with that.
3619,<|emo_surprise|> Yikes. I thought this was pretty chill.
3620,<|emo_surprise|> >[NAME] has a weird relationship with his father.
3622,<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe he won!
3623,"<|emo_surprise|> It really depends on your definition of a fascist. I am not a fascist because of the tactics, I am a fascist because of my political beliefs."
3624,"<|emo_surprise|> What can I say, it isn't surprising that it exists if it is, just like ""cute"" dogs."
3625,<|emo_surprise|> Damn! I‚Äôm surprised it took this long. I‚Äôd seen it 4 times in the past 2 months.
3626,"<|emo_surprise|> If they are allowed to buy and keep guns, why are they even required to training? Also, stop fortnite"
3627,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. Noted
3628,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that‚Äôs a real story
3629,<|emo_surprise|> Oh and now vini is down... Im almost done for the night.
3630,<|emo_surprise|> i feel curious about these
3631,<|emo_surprise|> Oh really? I only watched a short while but I think I liked it.
3632,<|emo_surprise|> I'm about to die when someone points out that [NAME] is a better defender than [NAME] is...
3633,<|emo_surprise|> I thought it was just the name of it but u/Kelsey__Peters said it was an actual thing
3634,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you‚Äôre awesome. üíú"
3635,<|emo_surprise|> Well he didnt get anything. That is a decent return. Hope he finds work.
3636,<|emo_surprise|> oh god i don‚Äôt know
3637,<|emo_surprise|> i don t really feel like any of the major characters are sympathetic
3638,"<|emo_surprise|> If you are that concerned, perhaps consider doing something productive while you are gone"
3639,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you came a long way from http!"
3640,<|emo_surprise|> I'm amazed there's still this sub :(
3641,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, a 3.5? "
3642,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I think I found it
3643,<|emo_surprise|> Omg this is so cool! Thanks for sharing!
3644,<|emo_surprise|> I didn't know it was that accurate.
3645,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that story was a real SHIT story. You guys are pro!"
3646,<|emo_surprise|> Oh gee he did it
3647,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Never knew there were so many here
3648,<|emo_surprise|> *Ow! I'm dead*
3649,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow this is the first I‚Äôve heard of this
3650,<|emo_surprise|> I've never been this happy to have a productive work week in the whole life of me
3651,<|emo_surprise|> What? I thought we were talking about this
3652,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, I never felt anything like that. Thanks for sharing!"
3653,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. That is so infuriating.
3654,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, your story is a real... interesting one."
3655,"<|emo_surprise|> Ahhh, the ""less of what you don't know"" argument."
3656,<|emo_surprise|> The [NAME] of horror!
3659,<|emo_surprise|> I am actually surprised everyone thinks he's going to win.
3661,<|emo_surprise|> Oh there goes my mind
3662,<|emo_surprise|> That is oddly specific.
3663,<|emo_surprise|> > And it's also why I'm so angry they're letting [NAME] walk
3664,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] this is why I‚Äôm glad I live in Cali
3665,<|emo_surprise|> i dont know why but it is making me feel such anticipation
3666,<|emo_surprise|> *flicking eyes in shocked silence* oh my god
3667,<|emo_surprise|> I have no idea how you do that lol you just straight up crush them
3668,<|emo_surprise|> oh god another injury
3669,<|emo_surprise|> Lmao. Thanks for your response. I'm really confused as to what to say. Really? I thought he had said it was fine.
3670,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that's amazing. What a story."
3671,<|emo_surprise|> There it is.
3672,<|emo_surprise|> Really surprised that [NAME] let him.
3673,<|emo_surprise|> I was shocked when they told the story. They seemed to genuinely believe what they were saying.
3674,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh man. Goodness, there are worse things to come by in your short life."
3675,<|emo_surprise|> So excited to have [NAME] back
3676,<|emo_surprise|> You must be fun at parties
3677,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME]... I thought it was [NAME] when I saw this
3678,"<|emo_surprise|> A weird thing happened though, her face seemed to solidify into the figure below."
3679,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, your mom is actually pretty smart lol"
3680,<|emo_surprise|> Omg I cant believe [NAME] didn't get fired
3681,<|emo_surprise|> Who knew [NAME] never had a problem leaving the net and was a legit threat all game long
3682,<|emo_surprise|> Wooooooooo!
3683,<|emo_surprise|> i feel overwhelmed because i dont know what i do yet
3684,<|emo_surprise|> Well done. Loved reading this. What a week.
3685,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. I didn‚Äôt even think of that. Thanks!
3686,<|emo_surprise|> My life is complete
3687,<|emo_surprise|> That was the only correct answer. Why is it surprising there's been such bad faith on this issue?
3688,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised [NAME] let her post that. Sounds awful.
3690,<|emo_surprise|> Haha! That‚Äôs totally something I would do.
3691,<|emo_surprise|> i didnt know there wasnt a lot posted on any of these sites and i was feeling pretty skeptical about it just as I had been for a few years
3692,<|emo_surprise|> It would be weird to be able to fly
3693,<|emo_surprise|> That's... quite unexpected actually
3694,<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs like a miracle
3695,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is something [NAME] can do, I think I'm in for a surprise"
3696,<|emo_surprise|> What a waste of packaging.
3697,"<|emo_surprise|> I've always wondered what became of [NAME] after he left OG. Was it too successful for him to just ""melt"" on the scene?"
3698,<|emo_surprise|> What's really interesting is that he changed his story a ton without actually confirming it.
3699,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if they feel the need to go through a makeup test before they submit an application.
3702,<|emo_surprise|> > But that's why I'm afraid to fly. Because the government contracts them out to private pilots? Who can tell.
3703,<|emo_surprise|> So did mine! :)
3704,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling very amazed at what i did
3705,<|emo_surprise|> i had to agree with him which is somewhat surprising as i had been feeling pretty impressed with him in that area
3706,"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, I wish the top comment was the only one that said that."
3707,"<|emo_surprise|> How? The tax code already bars investment income, and that income does not ""earn"" taxed money. Not to mention it taxes almost everyone."
3708,"<|emo_surprise|> So....I‚Äôm in. I mean I‚Äôm not in yet, but I‚Äôm eager to catch the second game. "
3709,<|emo_surprise|> I thought I was the only one!
3710,"<|emo_surprise|> Omg yes, she said ""Is it possible for me to change?"" and i said yes."
3714,<|emo_surprise|> Happy Birthday!
3717,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh no, [NAME]. What did I say?"
3718,<|emo_surprise|> This was amazing
3719,<|emo_surprise|> i didnt do anything but just enjoy it
3720,<|emo_surprise|> This is so cool. Wearing your heart on your sleeve so to speak. I wish I actually did this myself.
3721,<|emo_surprise|> Lol he actually called in sick
3722,<|emo_surprise|> That seems like months ago. I'm glad you're still with us!
3723,<|emo_surprise|> i feel really amazed and relieved
3724,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what that is...
3725,<|emo_surprise|> And you were wondering how she was doing on Reddit.
3727,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]. She is not normal.
3728,<|emo_surprise|> Oh good lord I didn‚Äôt even realize he was injured...
3729,<|emo_surprise|> i have a feeling it could be amazing and the best of both worlds
3730,<|emo_surprise|> I'm shocked the state of Arizona doesn't have a version of this.
3731,<|emo_surprise|> How wonderful. Please tell me you got it.
3732,<|emo_surprise|> oh and now vini is down
3733,<|emo_surprise|> You are creepy
3734,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, didn't know that there were so many here... I am so happy"
3735,<|emo_surprise|> Damn I love me some winter depression
3736,<|emo_surprise|> i feel this strange sense of wonder strange wonder
3737,<|emo_surprise|> He was very funny and knew his stuff. Very importantly he never said anything racist.
3738,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how he got his hands on the 2 x4?
3739,<|emo_surprise|> i love [NAME] she‚Äôs so strong i really feel for her
3742,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow! I see no sign of him being abusive lol!!
3743,<|emo_surprise|> i don t feel quite impressed by this picture and wonder if it is a bad one
3745,<|emo_surprise|> i could feel myself catching my breath
3746,<|emo_surprise|> OMG what? He didn't actually lose by more than 20 points...
3747,"<|emo_surprise|> If you think that the only path to a successful life is doing the dishes, you've never lived."
3748,<|emo_surprise|> You don't know what the real name of the film is? You are truly living in the 90s
3750,<|emo_surprise|> The irony..he's trying to save us from the high cost of medical care
3751,"<|emo_surprise|> Thanks for sharing, I really thought I was alone for posting this."
3752,<|emo_surprise|> Yuck i didn't say anything about having fun but im definitely discouraged. Well done OP you did!
3753,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh my god, there is an actual subreddit for cheating on your wife"
3754,<|emo_surprise|> Well it is weird I hope you like it
3755,"<|emo_surprise|> No offense, but your parents are assholes."
3756,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised more people don't already know this.
3757,"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] these are horrible... I mean no one could ever do that for us, how awful"
3758,<|emo_surprise|> i feel so overwhelmed by it all
3760,"<|emo_surprise|> If you happen to be in the area, stop by and pick it up. I'd love some local beer and tacos "
3761,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, you are strong, look like you took a trip down memory lane"
3762,<|emo_surprise|> Oh yeah sorry
3763,<|emo_surprise|> I just read it and wondered what the comment was about. Weird phrasing
3764,<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is amazing. üòÅ I love our dairy free options now but haven't thought of it until I saw this
3765,<|emo_surprise|> You‚Äôre right! It‚Äôs amazing to think how far ahead of her time it was in terms of politics. What a horrible underestimate
3766,<|emo_surprise|> i do not feel shy
3768,"<|emo_surprise|> Ah, the original turd burger"
3769,<|emo_surprise|> i remember feeling at the time shocked and amazed by the way he wrote the first draft of the book
3770,"<|emo_surprise|> That's a pretty generous offer, to be fair. Hopefully he'll take it."
3771,<|emo_surprise|> i was sitting at my desk feeling funny and it was strange to look up and then look around
3772,"<|emo_surprise|> Ah, it's that other ""got legs"" kid that I've wondered about"
3773,"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is a very nice man, and he reassured me that other relationships arent just physical ones, but also mental ones, too! "
3774,<|emo_surprise|> I've seen the behind the scenes videos of these shows and they're actually quite fascinating.
3775,<|emo_surprise|> It's pretty odd that he gave such a broadside against Amazon. [NAME] I'd love any details!
3776,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] can you hear that? Oh my [NAME]
3777,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Not really cringe. Just... Wow.
3778,<|emo_surprise|> What do you know about [NAME]?
3779,<|emo_surprise|> Yikes...I don't like him.
3780,"<|emo_surprise|> This is amazing, I love Reddit!"
3781,<|emo_surprise|> i am not feeling fearful of anything
3782,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh. I got you.
3783,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised [NAME] didn't catch that.
3784,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised he doesn't say ""I'm not sleeping well"" over and over"
3785,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I thought he played a lot worse than he said
3786,<|emo_surprise|> You've gotta be a weirdo to think such a thing might exist.
3787,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm just wondering how that‚Äôs possible and why this is hard to believe
3788,<|emo_surprise|> This is an opportunity I never saw coming
3789,<|emo_surprise|> What a fucking monster.
3790,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, didn't know [NAME] was a [NAME] fan"
3791,"<|emo_surprise|> Omg, the face"
3792,<|emo_surprise|> i got a feeling there was some mistake made that made it look like a single handed job
3793,<|emo_surprise|> wow that‚Äôs so true
3794,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised he didn't say it was *almost* aollipop
3795,<|emo_surprise|> That's one way to ruin his story. He needs to get off that story.
3796,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] I didn't know that
3797,<|emo_surprise|> >the guy who actually showed up to the event had some weird idea of what he was doing and went for a long time without saying anything He was just a normal attendee who thought he was going to sing the national anthem.
3798,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if everyone knows what an ex-secretive firm is.
3799,<|emo_surprise|> I like surprises.
3800,<|emo_surprise|> My god. Oh my god it's so bonkers.
3801,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I didn't really know this, is that right? Thanks!"
3802,"<|emo_surprise|> I had a similar thought, I hope it isn‚Äôt just isolated. "
3803,<|emo_surprise|> The amount of hate that some random internet stranger has gotten in comments on this thread... I've become numb to it all. Good times.
3804,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised she's not press charges.
3805,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised [NAME] didn't give her a hug. She can take a lot but she can't take much less
3806,<|emo_surprise|> That sounds weird.
3807,<|emo_surprise|> i feel something is fishy omg
3808,<|emo_surprise|> The only one I really feel sorry for is his sister
3809,<|emo_surprise|> >he actually believes he can control 10% of the population What a fucking knob right?
3810,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, I didn't see it. Was wondering how it works atm."
3812,"<|emo_surprise|> >""Wow"" Love it."
3813,"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, I'm so sorry this happened to you."
3814,<|emo_surprise|> And people would still continue to use it. That's almost crazy.
3815,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, we‚Äôre still using old power tool bits "
3816,<|emo_surprise|> OMG! A 6 pack! That's awesome! I'm in my late thirties.
3817,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh no, my [NAME] forgot about the cup of tea"
3818,<|emo_surprise|> Lmao omg yes
3819,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a sense of helplessness
3820,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, my two favorite franchises and my two favorite childhoods. This thread is going to be a huge help for me in the future, thanks for sharing! Edit: thanks for the edit "
3821,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling surprised at times
3822,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh boy, the new year's eve special! It'll be a super special surprise, as well."
3823,"<|emo_surprise|> The comment was so terrible, I almost downvoted it just because it made me so cringe."
3824,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a bit helpless this week
3825,<|emo_surprise|> What a cringeworthy list
3826,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I didn‚Äôt know [NAME] was in a rock band!
3828,<|emo_surprise|> Wow...love that
3829,<|emo_surprise|> Well that's bizarre
3830,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow didn't even realize they were on a video, what a weird one"
3831,<|emo_surprise|> Weird how [NAME] just pulled off a surprising 4.5 over [NAME] in his rookie year. How strange.
3832,<|emo_surprise|> oh geez i never noticed that. I thought you were just joking about that.
3833,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I see. Well I guess I have been wrong.
3834,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] here...that guac looks horrible
3836,<|emo_surprise|> WTH?!?!??!!!
3837,<|emo_surprise|> i feel the strange mix of anxiety and excitement that usually comes with these things
3838,"<|emo_surprise|> What a bummer, but we are in the process of finding a new coach at this point."
3839,"<|emo_surprise|> Well, it was the best available 4 player roster and it‚Äôs still a terrible record 14 years later "
3840,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised they're allowed to. Even worse is that some states don't have laws against child labor, so the kids are actually forced into these jobs"
3841,<|emo_surprise|> How did you get onto an ASMR video?
3842,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I thought I was the only one who was shocked to say that
3843,<|emo_surprise|> omg this is a good read
3844,<|emo_surprise|> What a weird world we live in
3845,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow! Thanks for sharing!
3846,<|emo_surprise|> Wow...I don't even know what to say about that
3847,<|emo_surprise|> It makes you wonder just how isolated you are...
3850,<|emo_surprise|> i did though cause of that one day feeling shocked was that i could truly relate
3851,<|emo_surprise|> Oh god.... üòÇ
3852,<|emo_surprise|> Oh no he didn't!
3854,"<|emo_surprise|> No biggie, thanks, I meant to be sarcastic, but I'm not."
3855,<|emo_surprise|> Omg!!
3856,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh boy, she has more confidence than [NAME] and [NAME]."
3857,"<|emo_surprise|> So, do I watch porn or not at all?"
3859,<|emo_surprise|> Hahaha I see what you did there!
3860,<|emo_surprise|> i feel kinda amazed that my mom couldnt imagine this
3861,<|emo_surprise|> i find myself constantly wondering how can im not feeling pretty
3862,<|emo_surprise|> I was surprised to see ten different names for the same thing on this subreddit
3863,<|emo_surprise|> So you're actually a racist? Wow. I'm sorry.
3864,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I didn't know there was a name for that.
3865,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, I can hear the beeping!"
3866,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, I totally forgot about that episode. What a nightmare.rated T"
3867,<|emo_surprise|> She‚Äôs a pro-Assad piece of shit.
3868,<|emo_surprise|> i feel amazing with just three hours of sleep
3870,<|emo_surprise|> Well good for you man. Enjoy the loss. Stay strong.
3871,"<|emo_surprise|> This is amazing, I love photography"
3872,<|emo_surprise|> Holy crap this stuff is awesome!
3873,<|emo_surprise|> OMG she's 30
3874,<|emo_surprise|> i feel strange calling myself christian or a jesus here on earth it s my birthright
3875,<|emo_surprise|> i feel completely overwhelmed
3876,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh look, it's Shrek Ghrok!"
3877,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is the same dude that's against divorce for all of us. The problem is he's also fighting against wealth and taking it in his own personal hands
3879,<|emo_surprise|> Hahaha I'm surprised they are charged as a defense.
3881,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling a little surprised by the lack of negative reaction from this thread
3883,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow she sounds like a really good friend
3884,"<|emo_surprise|> No, no, no!"
3885,<|emo_surprise|> Ahhhh I see now
3886,<|emo_surprise|> Omg lol where were you?
3888,<|emo_surprise|> What a year.
3889,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, my parents died, I love them "
3890,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that really is disgusting"
3891,<|emo_surprise|> What a wake up call! It‚Äôs crazy
3892,<|emo_surprise|> Wow - you are quite the romantic...
3893,<|emo_surprise|> Omg I actually thought it was funny until you mentioned the.
3894,<|emo_surprise|> Really surprised he didn‚Äôt get sent to the minors
3895,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like no one is saying anything right now after he posted his video on yTube and r/iamverysmart which is weird im so envious of this guy
3896,<|emo_surprise|> This is an incredible wealthcare scam
3897,<|emo_surprise|> Oh cool! I didn't know! Please let me know if you find it too funny to edit. Cheers!
3898,<|emo_surprise|> Oh shittt i got sent to the rubbish!
3899,<|emo_surprise|> Really? I mean I'm not sure what you are on about but I've heard alot about how good he is at throwing and have watched some of his videos
3900,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is playing tonight because [NAME] played yesterday. [NAME] is playing tomorrow because [NAME] had a serious injury
3901,<|emo_surprise|> i wonder why but it feels very strange i feel really strange
3902,<|emo_surprise|> Omg that‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve ever said that about the service industry
3903,"<|emo_surprise|> It's okay, I didn't say anything about food allergies. I just noticed that I was actually eating out this evening and that was pretty odd."
3904,<|emo_surprise|> Wow how incredibly dangerous
3906,<|emo_surprise|> My [NAME] this is so funny
3907,<|emo_surprise|> OMG this kid is going to end up a Sounder someday....
3908,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, that speaks to me"
3909,"<|emo_surprise|> Omg, it's a fake YT channel wtf"
3910,"<|emo_surprise|> No I don‚Äôt, you‚Äôre a weirdo. "
3911,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I did not realize that the top comment in the thread was from a [NAME] cosplayer! This means the world!
3912,"<|emo_surprise|> This is what has gotten me so worked up about this so much, the fact he‚Äôs aian himself "
3915,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, a no call"
3917,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you're so right!"
3918,<|emo_surprise|> What a night.
3919,"<|emo_surprise|> If you've seen the trailers for Wonder Woman and The Lego Movie, you'll know that this series absolutely teases the genre. "
3920,<|emo_surprise|> So...what?
3921,"<|emo_surprise|> Really surprised I had to come this far down to find these. Take a seatbelted shirt, we've had better things to do"
3922,<|emo_surprise|> Damn you're strong haven't you?
3923,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised everyone thinks [NAME] is hot.
3924,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] i wanted to die
3925,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling really skeptical about the whole bfg thing
3926,<|emo_surprise|> Well that's the first time I've ever had a comment like that on this sub
3927,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised he wasn't a tad more obnoxious when he told his mom he didn't know the difference between a can of beans and a can of Pringles
3929,<|emo_surprise|> What a crazy story.
3930,<|emo_surprise|> i feel shocked by it all and wonder whats next
3931,<|emo_surprise|> Well damn.
3932,"<|emo_surprise|> Weird, I thought there was just a tree."
3933,<|emo_surprise|> This is beautiful!
3934,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if [NAME] would comment on that if she is being treated like a freak. I have not seen how she deals with her irrational fear of her own body.
3935,<|emo_surprise|> How dare you
3936,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh!!!!
3937,<|emo_surprise|> It was honestly one of the funniest things I‚Äôve read on here in a while.
3938,<|emo_surprise|> What in the actual fuck why are you doing this???
3939,<|emo_surprise|> wow I didn‚Äôt know that of a guy actually exists
3941,<|emo_surprise|> Omg [NAME] you‚Äôre on fire!
3942,<|emo_surprise|> And if he does not he is required to substance abuse counseling for at least 6 months.
3943,<|emo_surprise|> It's hard to believe someone with this mindset actually watches porn
3944,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. That's so weird to hear. Are you with park services?
3945,"<|emo_surprise|> And, guess how he fits? A forward? A winger? A defender?"
3946,<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit I thought you‚Äôd be more specific
3947,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. Are all of them?
3948,<|emo_surprise|> And I thought everyone hated the Wonder Woman movie!!
3949,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, in 5 days the CFF will be up. I‚Äôm out here for one ü§£"
3952,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! Thank you! We live in a country that was written off as hopeless just a while ago. We're doing much better than you.
3953,<|emo_surprise|> Wow your husband's so cool
3955,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like its not going to convince any court because
3956,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling amazed to awake in the morning
3957,<|emo_surprise|> They played the song twice and it was both times during the game. Weird
3959,<|emo_surprise|> i don t feel as surprised as i did with the news that i am a mom
3960,<|emo_surprise|> Oh of course it is!!!
3962,<|emo_surprise|> No. They're worried you may be stealing their thunder.
3963,<|emo_surprise|> And I thought we were losing to Boston. Wait no nevermind
3964,<|emo_surprise|> i feel very strange but also very happy
3965,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, it was that?"
3966,<|emo_surprise|> oh what a surprise i couldn't have guessed
3967,<|emo_surprise|> Holy fuck I miss this.
3968,<|emo_surprise|> Yup that game ended with [NAME] diving through the back (my favourite part of that video)
3970,<|emo_surprise|> She looks so damn cute in that dress
3971,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I knew someone else had the same idea!
3972,<|emo_surprise|> Omg stop spamming.
3973,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] that's so delicious!
3974,"<|emo_surprise|> Ah okay okay, thanks for the correction. This post makes me sad"
3975,<|emo_surprise|> That was a good one
3976,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] has been here for literally 11 years. Never been worse.
3977,<|emo_surprise|> Why do I love you?
3979,<|emo_surprise|> What a year to be a teen!!!
3980,<|emo_surprise|> oh the worst
3981,<|emo_surprise|> Ohhhhh my gosh! That poor janitor! Poor janitor!!!!
3982,<|emo_surprise|> He was such a pleasant surprise!
3983,<|emo_surprise|> Who thought it was a boy?
3984,<|emo_surprise|> I'm honestly surprised this isn't on the front page.
3986,<|emo_surprise|> i was left feeling surprised and also a bit more skeptical
3987,<|emo_surprise|> oh god a cat!
3988,<|emo_surprise|> And it only gets worse. Because the rate at which these people deforesting trees is so out of whack that it's actually astounding.
3989,<|emo_surprise|> i have some problems feeling a bit overwhelmed
3990,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] has a fucking family!!!!
3991,<|emo_surprise|> WTH? Just crazy.
3993,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, you just described my life!!!"
3995,<|emo_surprise|> >I know a couple of people who do Exactly Yep.
3996,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow that's amazing. I did the same exact thing. I'm still healing from it btw, hope everything works out for you, mate. "
3997,<|emo_surprise|> What a game. Gotta stay alive in a group of 6 to take all the damage. Very frustrating.
3998,<|emo_surprise|> They‚Äôre the loudest and most obnoxious animals that I‚Äôve ever seen on a ship.
3999,"<|emo_surprise|> A surprise no, but a welcome one "
4000,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, she still hasn't helped even though you had it out with her."
4001,<|emo_surprise|> This looks like the work of a madman.
4002,<|emo_surprise|> Just wow.
4003,<|emo_surprise|> i feel surprised that a video has that much of a following
4004,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] damn I want those damn dunks for my free throw shooting!
4005,"<|emo_surprise|> I remember the first time I watched it, it was on VHS, it was incredible. Shocking stuff."
4006,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like i ve gone from being surprised everyday to Wow this dude is crazy
4007,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh no, the poor man"
4008,<|emo_surprise|> You. I know. How.
4009,"<|emo_surprise|> > It was like a Super 7 storeys high wire walker. Yes, your imagination is off base!"
4010,"<|emo_surprise|> Omg, I actually just went about my day, what a day!"
4011,<|emo_surprise|> Oh for sure! I did a double take that was as close as I could go.
4014,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm 5'11"" and my mom always comments how thin I am. I must have looked 13 years old."
4015,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how the hell that works... :*
4016,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that's awesome. Good for you! It's going to take a lot of time for her to recover, but you did an amazing job. "
4017,<|emo_surprise|> How I have never heard of this. So strange
4018,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder why theian are so upset
4019,<|emo_surprise|> Omg that was a high five
4021,<|emo_surprise|> I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre considering this
4022,<|emo_surprise|> i feel something is not quite right
4023,<|emo_surprise|> Haha well this could have gone any other way. Loved that fight.
4024,<|emo_surprise|> WTH? Just terrible.
4025,<|emo_surprise|> This is so cool and I love it
4026,<|emo_surprise|> I was wondering what that was!!
4027,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I'm really not sure how this works but I'll remember this comment. Thanks for catching me. Ok! 
4028,<|emo_surprise|> Oh boy. I am in for a surprise
4029,"<|emo_surprise|> It was only a matter of time before someone started to think ""I can't wait until spring break"" and start working on their offseason shit."
4030,<|emo_surprise|> Oh man. Is it that bad [NAME]? That live performance was absolutely beautiful
4031,<|emo_surprise|> Omg this is the most recent news I read about her. Wow at what she accomplished while in office.
4032,<|emo_surprise|> i can feel that i ve grown a lot in just a matter of months
4033,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling skeptical about everything
4034,<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit that's nothing
4035,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I've never read that before!
4036,<|emo_surprise|> I can‚Äôt believe this is real
4037,<|emo_surprise|> What a gift. What a miracle.
4038,<|emo_surprise|> And how she didn't name her service dog after a movie character...
4039,<|emo_surprise|> Damn I never knew there were so many people who liked this!
4040,<|emo_surprise|> I love [NAME] and the rest of the Pats but......
4041,<|emo_surprise|> What a weird and wonderful thing to read about
4042,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, are you saying they didn't get the ball because [NAME] wasn't on the court?"
4043,"<|emo_surprise|> I haven't found many comments that were as outraged as ""you should've told him to stop eating shit"""
4044,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, wow. You are quite the romantic..."
4045,<|emo_surprise|> Oh gosh it's actually happening!
4046,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] don't you know
4048,"<|emo_surprise|> Ah yes, the ""for my own good"" part."
4049,<|emo_surprise|> This is weird. The image is slightly worse then the description.
4050,<|emo_surprise|> Happy Cake day bruh
4051,<|emo_surprise|> This is so cool! Thanks for sharing though. Lol
4052,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I did not know state laws did not contemplate a drunk driver."
4053,"<|emo_surprise|> Lol, it's okay, I'm not upset! "
4054,<|emo_surprise|> What a bummer. [NAME] is a special talent. I can't imagine him ever being 4th
4055,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs fantastic news! You‚Äôre right to be worried. Good to know that she‚Äôs getting away
4056,<|emo_surprise|> Oh the irony in the title
4057,<|emo_surprise|> i began to feel a little overwhelmed
4058,"<|emo_surprise|> Hey, it's a movie. Not a joke"
4059,<|emo_surprise|> i thought about feeling overwhelmed sometimes
4060,<|emo_surprise|> Oh! I didn't see that! Thanks!
4061,<|emo_surprise|> I really want a hot dog. But that's also why I'm posting this. Because I really want a hot dog and I can‚Äôt find one
4062,<|emo_surprise|> No biggy.
4064,<|emo_surprise|> I was just in shock...
4065,"<|emo_surprise|> If the Saints can't figure this out, they might go below.500 that year."
4066,<|emo_surprise|> Ah damn.
4067,"<|emo_surprise|> Lol, what has the meme been up to since I've been posting it?"
4068,<|emo_surprise|> I remember seeing that on the news
4069,<|emo_surprise|> Well I have a feeling they won't let him go to a school other than Harvard..
4070,<|emo_surprise|> Wow...reserved seats have never been this sold out
4071,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that‚Äôs awesome! Congratulations! Have a nice day
4072,<|emo_surprise|> What? I didn't say anything.
4073,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] it's [NAME]! I've been waiting for this!!!!
4074,<|emo_surprise|> Thanks I didn't notice. I'll have to get used to it.
4075,<|emo_surprise|> My [NAME] brother has been with my mother for 30 years. 20 years! She does wonder what her son is doing with his life.
4076,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] has some pretty weird words.
4077,<|emo_surprise|> Ah the high life. Must be sweet.
4078,<|emo_surprise|> Well that was damn funny.
4080,<|emo_surprise|> What a surprise.
4081,<|emo_surprise|> I thought they were having a field day and wondered how many had it.
4083,<|emo_surprise|> i am really feeling this shocked and appalled by what ive seen today
4084,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling like im really being the strange one
4085,<|emo_surprise|> The whole story is an absolute bollocks.
4086,"<|emo_surprise|> You're the worst kind of person, trust me, you are."
4087,<|emo_surprise|> And you know it wouldn't do him any good if people found out he was also a porn star
4089,<|emo_surprise|> He also got the weirdest possible treatment for his back. He had a spine spasm at the time too.
4090,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, I didn't see the article about the cat attacking the dog, just some old folks talking about a funny bug that doesn't happen."
4091,<|emo_surprise|> i cannot say how amazed i am to find myself writing a book about a subject that i feel is so dear to my heart
4092,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs a terrifying amount of bp for a 1/4 scale figure.
4094,<|emo_surprise|> Damn that‚Äôs a good one to have in your back pocket!
4095,"<|emo_surprise|> I was wondering how often it updated, and it's always update was like 5 times between now and then."
4096,<|emo_surprise|> And wow how she kept getting younger. All the adults seem amazed.
4097,<|emo_surprise|> i feel very strange these days
4098,<|emo_surprise|> Haha love it.
4099,<|emo_surprise|> I'm really surprised the Steelers didn't take him off the PUP list
4100,<|emo_surprise|> i just think i should be doing something more useful for myself without some ridiculous expectations
4101,"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, that is the first time I‚Äôve ever grown fond of [NAME]. "
4102,<|emo_surprise|> What a fucking moron lol. What a moron lol.
4103,<|emo_surprise|> Hahaha this is the dumbest thing I've seen today.
4104,<|emo_surprise|> Wow no wonder everyone is mad about this ad
4105,<|emo_surprise|> The irony! üòÇ
4106,<|emo_surprise|> He's 40
4107,"<|emo_surprise|> The guy who reviews movies doesn't like them, he reviews them because he enjoyed them, and he'll find fault with almost any part of them."
4108,<|emo_surprise|> i mean i feel quite stunned by it
4109,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh I wish you had a video to share, i'd be impressed"
4110,<|emo_surprise|> Ouch! My hear sank. I think I damaged my hearing
4111,<|emo_surprise|> > What kind of relationship? Why do you say you‚Äôm in a relationship?
4113,<|emo_surprise|> That was truly an amazing play by [NAME]. Did not know [NAME] had a son the 5 that high.
4114,<|emo_surprise|> Omg no way [NAME] just got called a muh racist by another native american 
4116,<|emo_surprise|> I'm amazed people found all this stuff
4117,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] I feel attacked!
4119,<|emo_surprise|> What the hell? I thought he liked to throw chairs and keep walking out from behind them.
4120,<|emo_surprise|> Wow what an asshole.
4123,<|emo_surprise|> My new favourite bromance
4124,<|emo_surprise|> Can you believe that shit actually got downvoted? Lol!
4125,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow your sister is a pro-Assad piece of shit, I‚Äôm glad your mom didn‚Äôt encourage you to go to school."
4126,"<|emo_surprise|> Well, no, but people do really like or are easily attracted to others of the same sex."
4127,<|emo_surprise|> A surprise turn of events! I'll have to remember this one.
4128,"<|emo_surprise|> Holy miracle worker, what a surprise. He hasn‚Äôt told anyone yet."
4129,<|emo_surprise|> Wow so brave!
4130,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow. If you haven‚Äôt seen it, it absolutely is shocking."
4131,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I didn't know that there was a term for that
4132,<|emo_surprise|> Omg what??? I thought it was a bookmark üòÇüòÇ
4133,<|emo_surprise|> i was left feeling amazed amazed and surprised
4134,<|emo_surprise|> i never got that feeling like in that movie but the feeling is probably still there even now and i still cant help that it s driving me insane even now
4135,<|emo_surprise|> Wow what a rude way to say I love you.
4136,<|emo_surprise|> i feel completely overwhelmed and i want to give it all up but im afraid
4137,<|emo_surprise|> i feel that the young people from across the world are becoming more interested in music not so much as dance but in the theory and theory alone
4138,<|emo_surprise|> What a find. I was wondering what kind of questions to ask but I feel better than expected
4141,<|emo_surprise|> The absolute worst!
4142,<|emo_surprise|> i know there are still some folks down south who wonder why i m down south but i feel oddly stunned thinking about it
4143,<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe [NAME] actually called his mom...
4144,<|emo_surprise|> Oh...oh....
4145,<|emo_surprise|> i feel curious about this
4147,<|emo_surprise|> I can‚Äôt believe [NAME] beat [NAME] so handily that last time
4150,<|emo_surprise|> oh of course
4151,"<|emo_surprise|> Ahhhh, I see... I had no idea the term ""plaintiff"" had even come into common parlance!"
4152,<|emo_surprise|> The guy who plays [NAME] is like the voice of [NAME] if [NAME] had a son
4153,<|emo_surprise|> Omg 10/10 would I do that again?
4155,<|emo_surprise|> Oh no!!!!!!
4156,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh it looks amazing in this pic tbh
4157,<|emo_surprise|> Hey just noticed.. got a text a couple days ago that my post was seen by 695 people! Oh my thank you!
4158,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, I didn't read all of it, but if they were implying that it was the owner of the business fault, I didn't see any."
4159,<|emo_surprise|> What a weird thing to be disillusioned about.
4160,<|emo_surprise|> What a surprise that an earlier version of this website used this name
4161,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh no, I didn't mean to cause any trouble for you"
4162,<|emo_surprise|> Wow i didn't even read that...
4163,<|emo_surprise|> This will forever be my most fav April moment
4164,<|emo_surprise|> Oh look at this
4165,<|emo_surprise|> She should be ashamed of herself
4166,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow! Thanks for the advice. It sounds like a very difficult thing to do.
4167,<|emo_surprise|> What?! That‚Äôs so amazing...I‚Äôm so surprised couldn‚Äôt go with it üòÇ
4168,"<|emo_surprise|> My [NAME]! Your birthday today, too! What a honor to have him celebrate with us!"
4169,<|emo_surprise|> i feel overwhelmed but i can control the flow of the water and the pressure
4170,<|emo_surprise|> Can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre saying this. I have never seen a person so un considerate and nice
4171,"<|emo_surprise|> How? You had more than 1,000 subscribers at the peak."
4172,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like a strangeo being a school girl by watching this
4173,<|emo_surprise|> What a complete and utter cunt.
4175,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs right! You‚Äôre no help! Your mother probably sucks for another reason!
4176,<|emo_surprise|> That's awesome! What did you do to deserve that fine?
4177,<|emo_surprise|> How did I not know this?!?!?!? Omg!
4178,<|emo_surprise|> i feel surprised and impressed if i think about it like ive done before
4179,<|emo_surprise|> Sooooo happy for [NAME]!!
4180,<|emo_surprise|> Oh that goes without saying tbh
4181,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling funny but at the same time im a little worried about my progress on that front
4182,<|emo_surprise|> Omg [NAME] made my day!
4183,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh god, no. That one hurts."
4186,<|emo_surprise|> i feel quite impressed
4187,<|emo_surprise|> Hey this game got real serious last year with all these invitationals. This is the first year its been like this.
4188,<|emo_surprise|> Omg. You‚Äôre such a gift.
4189,"<|emo_surprise|> Omg, I‚Äôm so sorry! üòÇ"
4190,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what that's like for a trans man.
4191,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] that's so sad!
4192,<|emo_surprise|> That's an adventure!
4193,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you had me at ""WWW.RUNTIMEBOUT""."
4194,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling very overwhelmed like at points yesterday
4195,<|emo_surprise|> What a crazy story...
4197,"<|emo_surprise|> If you're looking for a specific example of racism, you shouldn't watch the documentary [NAME] on YouTube."
4198,<|emo_surprise|> i feel the same emotions but i think i am less aware of them
4199,<|emo_surprise|> It's pretty amazing how few people in this thread know about this.
4201,"<|emo_surprise|> Why yes, that is absolutely disgusting."
4202,"<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs so cool, how does it work? I‚Äôm pretty new here, no idea. Thanks"
4203,<|emo_surprise|> He could easily get 2 stars if he held out for 2 longer. Not bad buy.
4204,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my. Just realized I forgot how important it is to write a thank you note and how hard it is to find someone who is able to receive one.
4206,<|emo_surprise|> i feel surprised that such an old fool as me can call himself an imaman
4207,<|emo_surprise|> i don t feel shocked but im not sure if im getting more than what i thought
4209,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is giving us so much life
4210,<|emo_surprise|> i started off feeling surprised
4211,<|emo_surprise|> Wow so you guys actually believe what you say.
4212,<|emo_surprise|> Ahh another one of their members posting on reddit
4213,<|emo_surprise|> i feel so stunned that they can teach me anything i want to know about myself
4215,<|emo_surprise|> The second half is getting interesting tbh
4216,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling reluctant but eager to see this film
4217,"<|emo_surprise|> >it will help keep Canada a country worth fighting for when every single cent goes to pay for the next 10 years It‚Äôs an attractive argument. The problem I have is, they‚Äôre lying. "
4218,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, if you look at a tree that's alive it isn't dead. Sure looks like he's alive!"
4219,"<|emo_surprise|> This is actually interesting. When people are asked if they've ever had porn, they usually reply with ""I like it"" and a laugh"
4220,<|emo_surprise|> Haha I see what you did there
4221,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if any of this is *my* fault. I read the post... damn.
4222,<|emo_surprise|> You. Wanna. Wait. For..
4223,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh look, it's free with prime now! What a steal that was"
4224,<|emo_surprise|> It's so fucking creepy.
4225,"<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs amazing, I would of made the same move. Love the fact he didn‚Äôt get it"
4226,<|emo_surprise|> Damn. You must've been there for a good three minutes.
4227,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh for the love of [NAME], how do words fail you?"
4229,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, I didn't see that coming"
4230,<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs really amazing how [NAME] has never really been bad and [NAME] is the last one with a single goal and an assist all season
4231,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs crazy. We did it we got three.
4232,<|emo_surprise|> i can t help but feel a little touched and wondering what these men will do when this is all complete
4234,<|emo_surprise|> Wow.. I'm glad you were able to defeat him!
4235,<|emo_surprise|> A surprise turn of events. I'll never understand why it happened the way it did. Unbelievable.
4236,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, no wonder she's an ""outsider"" in her family!"
4237,<|emo_surprise|> Wow another vegan restaurant inore! Congrats on the business sense you have chosen! Where do you live then?
4238,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, your mom is a mama bear!"
4239,<|emo_surprise|> Omg my brain
4240,<|emo_surprise|> Omg no way [NAME] can be worse.... OP you're insane
4241,<|emo_surprise|> What a weird game
4242,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs a pretty high burden to carry
4243,<|emo_surprise|> He‚Äôs not sorry for anything....
4244,<|emo_surprise|> The only positive thing to come out of [NAME] comment was that he is still supporting [NAME].
4245,<|emo_surprise|> I'm honestly shocked you didn't get deleted.
4246,"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah, it kinda sucks how easily they can fool people into thinking their bullshit. "
4247,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised everyone is sharing it on social media.
4248,<|emo_surprise|> This is incredible. Wow.
4249,<|emo_surprise|> That's pretty hi!
4250,<|emo_surprise|> What? How does it work? The only change you're asking for is to get rid of the posts that use the old format and format!
4251,<|emo_surprise|> And to think we haven‚Äôt had a serious attempt at a meme since the days of [NAME]
4252,"<|emo_surprise|> He seemed to have a great sense of humor, surprising he didn't expect one of his employees to die."
4253,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I didn't realize they had season renewals."
4254,<|emo_surprise|> i was making a joke about how great it was not to feel so funny or just a little bit off
4255,<|emo_surprise|> What a weird way to introduce yourself...
4257,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I'm glad it's not just me
4258,<|emo_surprise|> It is strange to think of them having sex for the first time together.
4259,"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME], did we just get banned for asking about the price?"
4260,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh we did it
4261,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is a pro who's a pro who's a pro... Get the [NAME] out of here!
4263,"<|emo_surprise|> That first scene was awesome, wow. Damn, [NAME]"
4264,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME]. Stay strong [NAME]
4265,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that is quite a bit creepy
4266,<|emo_surprise|> That's an issue I had with the first book. Wherein we get a lot of background on and are surprised quite a few questions are resolved.
4267,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my. This can be a clue to something important.
4268,<|emo_surprise|> Yikes. Did he really say that? üòÜ
4269,<|emo_surprise|> wow so brave!
4270,<|emo_surprise|> i just know he is so agitated when he feels frustrated or unsure
4272,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a little helpless and somewhat of a fool
4273,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you‚Äôre on another level of dumb."
4274,<|emo_surprise|> Oh no we got assaulted
4275,<|emo_surprise|> This is terrifying. I'm a 22 y/o man and I was overjoyed when I found out I was going to be a father. Good news bro!
4276,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow no wonder they call it the ""shrug-off"" instead of the real thing. Smh"
4277,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! You're amazing. I'd be scared too if I were you.
4278,<|emo_surprise|> Oh it's a joke
4279,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a bit dazed here
4280,<|emo_surprise|> What did you do?
4281,"<|emo_surprise|> This looks like concept art, I think the shoes are hideous."
4282,<|emo_surprise|> Well that was stomach churning.
4283,<|emo_surprise|> I've heard such funny stories!
4286,<|emo_surprise|> So many tears - she is nothing but a god to me! She is my only comfort in a very long time.
4287,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if the [NAME] was in the bathroom for a second.
4288,<|emo_surprise|> What a shock it was for him to come out and say that.
4289,<|emo_surprise|> > But what is beauty? I haven't watched any horror movies yet so I don't know.
4290,<|emo_surprise|> Wow this was a thing back in the day. Weird.
4291,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling very pleased
4292,<|emo_surprise|> I think you need a stronger stomach to watch that video
4293,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised people didn't catch that comment was about [NAME] which makes it even more cringe worthy.
4294,<|emo_surprise|> i have not been feeling quite so lucky and its been more of a wake up call
4295,<|emo_surprise|> What surprised me was that he seemed to have no idea of where to get milk.
4296,<|emo_surprise|> This is so cool! I love art and fashion but this is awesome to see!
4297,<|emo_surprise|> They‚Äôre so eager to talk shit about anything any other politician. It‚Äôs insane.
4298,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a little bit more surprised
4299,<|emo_surprise|> Oh yahhhhh that's it I'm a creeper
4300,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME]!!!
4301,<|emo_surprise|> Omg yes! We need to sign her!
4302,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling a little overwhelmed but i am working on it
4303,<|emo_surprise|> You win again!
4304,<|emo_surprise|> Damn we got a new episode!? Lmao
4305,<|emo_surprise|> i feel surprised at first i am amazed at what i found
4306,<|emo_surprise|> I was surprised to see they had no idea!
4307,<|emo_surprise|> This is the sweetest.
4308,<|emo_surprise|> i want to ask but im feeling a little skeptical about that too
4309,<|emo_surprise|> i feel amazed to look at your work
4311,"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah the ‚Äúsad"" joke was a bit cringy. I‚Äôm just fine with people saying dumb stuff without actually saying it."
4312,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. I never knew this! How did you get in touch with them? I thought they were just friends :)
4313,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh look, he's Here and He'llavor you over the night shift worker."
4314,<|emo_surprise|> Omg! I'm so ashamed.
4315,<|emo_surprise|> i feel very emotional reading this article
4316,<|emo_surprise|> I feel like it's almost uncanny valley from hell right now.
4317,<|emo_surprise|> You freakin wizard!
4318,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that's amazing. So he went away a month later and came back a month later. That's impressive
4319,<|emo_surprise|> Wow dad this is amazing! I‚Äôm 20 and still this haha
4321,<|emo_surprise|> Lol no wonder people hate him so much..
4323,<|emo_surprise|> I was shocked to say the least. I hope he recover fast!
4324,<|emo_surprise|> I watched the news at 3:30 in the evening tonight. Was shocked at what my husband and I did to our own economy.
4326,"<|emo_surprise|> Heyyy, [NAME]! Don't worry about [NAME]."
4328,<|emo_surprise|> i was also surprised to see their new logo not showing the toro family s logo
4329,<|emo_surprise|> Oh no that's terrible. I'm so sorry for your loss
4330,<|emo_surprise|> Weird I like this so much
4332,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised he didn‚Äôt try to hit it off the bat.
4333,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. I‚Äôm so glad she did that. I hope you‚Äôre having a lot better life now!
4334,<|emo_surprise|> What the actual fuck lol
4335,<|emo_surprise|> What a weird relationship.
4336,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling a little overwhelmed with all the research i need to do
4337,<|emo_surprise|> Wow didn‚Äôt know I could ever say that
4338,<|emo_surprise|> Really? I had no idea he played for the Hurricanes.
4339,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] has such an adorable carryover from her smash broshness days!
4341,"<|emo_surprise|> It's interesting how that works, I think I might be an added bonus."
4342,<|emo_surprise|> The most recent pics are of [NAME] wearing his business suit and t shirt...
4344,<|emo_surprise|> Wow....
4346,<|emo_surprise|> I love you
4347,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! Didn't know [NAME] had a son...
4348,<|emo_surprise|> How weird.
4350,<|emo_surprise|> You got a mean phobia of owls!
4352,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, wow. Your calmness and non-escalation are truly something else...!"
4353,<|emo_surprise|> Just happened to me!
4354,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you have a very interesting and wonderful family history."
4355,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm just a child too I think I just remember her saying ‚Äúoh my. ‚Äù
4357,<|emo_surprise|> i did feel a little shocked at the age difference between them for sure but it wasnt as if it wasnt what was expected
4358,<|emo_surprise|> i feel weird about that
4359,<|emo_surprise|> i can feel i get a good night's sleep and i go to sleep with my eyes open
4361,<|emo_surprise|> What the hell is going on here. I've only been on Reddit a month or so but it's already crazy!
4362,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, she had *so* many close friends."
4363,<|emo_surprise|> Wow you‚Äôre cute
4364,"<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs a great way to say the N-word, lol."
4365,<|emo_surprise|> Yikes
4367,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME]. I'm so glad you weren't physically hurt
4368,<|emo_surprise|> i feel surprised that not many people know about it
4369,<|emo_surprise|> I'm still a little surprised that they're Both Over-Ear Shures.
4370,"<|emo_surprise|> What a hilarious, yet sad, story. I was so shocked to find such TBM goodness out there. "
4372,<|emo_surprise|> Wow 4K wow
4373,<|emo_surprise|> No wonder we don‚Äôt really have any isolation scorers
4374,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, just wow."
4375,<|emo_surprise|> I find all this to be very worrying.
4377,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm amazed at how quickly they found a picture without her hair on it, just her head shot."
4378,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow... Thats honestly pretty unexpected. I don't know how else to explain it.
4379,<|emo_surprise|> Omg so cringe
4380,<|emo_surprise|> *sobbing uncontrollably* OH MY GOD MOM!
4382,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs crazy. I‚Äôm scared to tell my parents.
4383,"<|emo_surprise|> Yup, I actually have no idea what's going on so I'm just guessing and being paranoid for no reason."
4384,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I'm so glad you're safe.
4385,<|emo_surprise|> Oh dear!
4386,<|emo_surprise|> I'm honestly shocked they're letting her use their escalator.
4387,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I‚Äôm sorry. Wasn‚Äôt aware of anything like that. Can you explain?
4388,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, my heart!"
4390,<|emo_surprise|> Lol. My heart!
4391,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that‚Äôs a big meal
4393,<|emo_surprise|> I'm shocked they don't have a vanity plate that reads ‚ÄúBeer Cheez‚Äù
4394,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG dad, they used [NAME] voice!"
4396,<|emo_surprise|> It surprise me how many of them are college students. Maybe it's the jobs?
4397,<|emo_surprise|> Omg this made me think about my late uncle. RIP
4398,<|emo_surprise|> That's quite a few months post...
4399,<|emo_surprise|> i guess im being generous it actually makes me feel a little hesitant that he doesnt know me from my blog
4400,"<|emo_surprise|> Well, here we go again..."
4401,"<|emo_surprise|> And also, they never mind that this happened on their campus."
4402,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how they do it. My pressure was just.6
4403,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] that poor janitor.
4404,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a tad more stunned and relieved having watched that video
4405,<|emo_surprise|> I would be surprised if they had any working control screens.
4406,"<|emo_surprise|> This is the first time I have ever heard of someone saying this, wow."
4407,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! All that work alone would've cost $72k! You've got a $100k budget
4408,<|emo_surprise|> What a lucky day we had.
4409,<|emo_surprise|> What a weird situation.
4410,<|emo_surprise|> Wow so much younger but still looks young
4411,<|emo_surprise|> OMG she sounds yummy
4412,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that‚Äôs an amazing first for her!"
4413,<|emo_surprise|> oh my gosh oh my gosh
4414,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, what a gift!"
4416,"<|emo_surprise|> Yuh, he's actually lying. He's not aologist, he knows science! "
4417,<|emo_surprise|> I fucking love bang
4418,<|emo_surprise|> Yeah I thought I was actually the only one who thought that! I was pretty surprised to be completely honest with you.
4419,<|emo_surprise|> I was just at that game and loved it!
4422,<|emo_surprise|> Oh damn that's yummy!
4423,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I‚Äôm hearing a lot of the same things and I‚Äôm just like 'yup, I hate Twitter' :)"
4424,<|emo_surprise|> What? They love him!
4425,<|emo_surprise|> I am shocked he found Tsurugi's video.
4426,<|emo_surprise|> My wife has been in abusive relationship her whole life and this is the first time she's bringing it up. It's crazy.
4427,"<|emo_surprise|> If it was me I would have called this about 5 mins ago, wasnt it?"
4428,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a bit overwhelmed
4429,<|emo_surprise|> What a crazy story. I spent like an entire weekend with her... I don't even know why I'm blogging.
4430,<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs a weird thing to say.
4431,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is my new favorite.
4432,<|emo_surprise|> Who the hell thought they were this close to the finish line.
4434,"<|emo_surprise|> I would be surprised if they were out front anyways because their media strategy seems aggressive, which is odd."
4435,<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is an edgelord reddit account!
4436,<|emo_surprise|> It's so weird that whenever I say I love his mask it gets bigger and bigger (in person tho)
4437,"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah, just a regular-sized store that caters to the tourist industry. It's a shame for Akron"
4438,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, never knew of that! I always thought my penis was small."
4439,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! You‚Äôre cool
4440,"<|emo_surprise|> Who has time for petty jealousies,HO is the only one you need be jealous of."
4441,<|emo_surprise|> i feel strange inside
4442,<|emo_surprise|> i honestly do not know how i feel about anything at all being fake
4443,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôve never seen a more adorable kitty
4444,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] was pretty embarrassed when he didn't start at centre
4445,"<|emo_surprise|> I had 3 kids, 7 years ago! I was pregnant right at the end, and then had a C-section. I still have that pain in my heart every time I think about it - I'll have a house-warming party for you tomorrow!"
4446,<|emo_surprise|> i guess what you mean is how you feel because no one is saying anything
4447,<|emo_surprise|> I thought he was gonna break his back on purpose lol. Didn't see it üòÇ
4448,<|emo_surprise|> Oof lmao sorry buddy
4449,"<|emo_surprise|> Thanks, I hate wondering what the joke is."
4450,<|emo_surprise|> Wow you can do it
4451,<|emo_surprise|> i was feeling really surprised when hes actually saying this
4452,<|emo_surprise|> *ouching to that*
4453,<|emo_surprise|> Who was surprised to see him there
4454,<|emo_surprise|> What‚Äôs the cringe?
4455,"<|emo_surprise|> wow that‚Äôs awesome! thanks for the update - I had a hard time guessing where it was, gotta check this game out next week!"
4456,"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, I got you bro"
4457,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised we haven‚Äôt started an investigation yet tbh
4458,<|emo_surprise|> i really dont know why i really feel this way about this game
4459,<|emo_surprise|> Oh look at that
4460,<|emo_surprise|> I'm shocked [NAME] let him use that as his Twitter handle
4463,<|emo_surprise|> i feel so stunned by the graciousness and graciousness of all of you in this world as a mom
4464,<|emo_surprise|> Wow a 3 year old!
4465,<|emo_surprise|> Damn [NAME] sure knows how
4466,<|emo_surprise|> I thought I was the only one! Was a surprise to be sure. But a welcome one.
4467,<|emo_surprise|> i feel so overwhelmed and i think i should look at myself again
4468,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh. Yes.
4469,<|emo_surprise|> OMG... Dad
4470,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that was quick"
4471,<|emo_surprise|> i actually thought i was going to be shocked when i noticed the hole in the wall behind me
4472,"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah but its like ""oh he fiths"""
4473,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a little weird calling it an adventure
4474,<|emo_surprise|> Can't believe they're admitting that [NAME] is a racist since he was a US senator.
4475,<|emo_surprise|> Wow another artist in our area has gone viral... Wow! Thanks [NAME] for sharing the love
4476,<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs very strange
4477,"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is a mama, and never let the baby cry... that was truly heartbreaking "
4478,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how many tries it took to get this.
4479,<|emo_surprise|> Omg a japanese delivered a surprise birthday gift
4480,<|emo_surprise|> Happy cakeday you came out safe!
4481,<|emo_surprise|> Wow did not see that coming ü§î
4482,<|emo_surprise|> I was wondering that too!
4484,"<|emo_surprise|> I could never afford the one with the live roof, but now I'm wondering if the other one is the same."
4485,<|emo_surprise|> So edgy!
4487,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling a bit overwhelmed
4488,<|emo_surprise|> He's got that look forever.
4489,<|emo_surprise|> Damn that‚Äôs cool i never heard of that but I hope it‚Äôs recent.
4490,<|emo_surprise|> What a game. That goal was absolutely vital
4491,<|emo_surprise|> The ‚Äúwe‚Äôre all here‚Äù is one of the most telling signs I've seen. [NAME] is a terrible defender even without him.
4492,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you‚Äôre so generous with the gift!"
4493,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I haven't seen all of them but I did go to their booth an once and got to take a picture with the booth itself
4494,<|emo_surprise|> WTF? Really!
4495,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] has been an interesting player to follow
4496,<|emo_surprise|> i feel overwhelmed by the joy i feel seeing you
4497,<|emo_surprise|> Oh. It‚Äôs you again.
4498,<|emo_surprise|> This surprised me. Did not even know that happened. Glad to hear this was a successful hire.
4499,<|emo_surprise|> i could go on and on about the fantastic things the men were saying about it and never seem to give you guys a reason to feel anything but smug
4500,<|emo_surprise|> I have no idea how she is still alive
4501,<|emo_surprise|> I'm shocked [NAME] let the hagelin brothers in. Agreed with [NAME] but this is just too damn shocking.
4502,<|emo_surprise|> i didnt know how it was that it seems like people are really good at their jobs and in one case actually managed to get paid money
4503,"<|emo_surprise|> oh, I see, you used the terms ""sick"" and ""rats"" once."
4504,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] looks so damn evil in that pic.
4505,<|emo_surprise|> I'm about to have a heart attack tonight because I have to readjust my expectations to accept a terrible price from a man for a service that was once very necessary.
4506,<|emo_surprise|> Oh hell it does
4508,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, can not believe your claim is off base."
4509,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs one of my favorite potential Dem candidates
4510,<|emo_surprise|> OMG I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre gonna say that about me.
4511,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, what a steal that forward pass was."
4512,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I thought you were more into comedy?"
4513,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like he was just being asked to do something and just didn t think about it and then he came to me and he said i was doing this
4514,"<|emo_surprise|> Omg I thought it was just a pic, what do you guys do about their rings..."
4515,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how he does it.
4516,<|emo_surprise|> He looks like he‚Äôs making a face...
4517,<|emo_surprise|> Wow i had no idea [NAME] was still alive
4518,<|emo_surprise|> Omg I cried out loud. I hope you guys are able to help their daughter.
4519,<|emo_surprise|> A surprise from a man of [NAME] character!
4520,<|emo_surprise|> im really feeling the effects its hard to be amazed as much
4521,"<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre wrong, I‚Äôm saying the problem is very very apparent."
4522,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is an absolute monster!
4523,"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, I‚Äôm surprised r/45minutes keeps it up. "
4524,<|emo_surprise|> Is that a fucking real thing? I'm really shocked he's okay.
4525,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, is that you?"
4526,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh god, no wonder Netflix couldn't match the service's performance."
4527,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh my, [NAME]!"
4528,<|emo_surprise|> This is amazing! Is this some kind of meme?
4530,<|emo_surprise|> Weird I could never even think of that
4531,<|emo_surprise|> It was funny until they started saying *boy.* Wait a minute...twain...the spelling was awful
4532,<|emo_surprise|> The surprise was more unexpected.
4534,<|emo_surprise|> Hahaha haha hahahaha
4536,<|emo_surprise|> How's that? It's a nice change of pace
4537,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, thank you so much for the gracious compliment, it makes my day."
4538,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, good lord."
4539,<|emo_surprise|> i didn't feel as surprised as i normally would
4540,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow okay
4541,<|emo_surprise|> i had a feeling she was going to become a loner
4542,<|emo_surprise|> Really? I only watched part and I was surprised the show kept its word count.
4543,<|emo_surprise|> I thought he was using aptic technique for the 2nd repost. That wasn‚Äôt an issue. I think he hit it on the open floor like a shooter
4545,<|emo_surprise|> The only problem I had was he didn‚Äôt know about the event happening
4546,"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] just lost her shit on the stand during her defense. GIVE her your facts, or your dignity will be assaulted and your honor will be called into question."
4547,<|emo_surprise|> You‚Äôre still a stranger if you‚Äôd even asked her out. Not creepy.
4548,<|emo_surprise|> That is amazing. I am overwhelmed and can not believe such amazing stories are happening on this sub. One tip of salt: do not share the link in a post.
4549,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I am more than pleasantly surprised I clicked this link
4550,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] was just talking to a buddy about why he was going so long without a camera because he thought it was cool.
4551,"<|emo_surprise|> wow, you took your sweet daughter to a dinner party and told her ""god damn no you didn't"""
4552,<|emo_surprise|> I couldn't even begin to imagine how horrible this would be
4553,<|emo_surprise|> This is amazing thank you so much for sharing!
4554,<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre the only woman who has wondered if you could do that.
4555,<|emo_surprise|> I'm confused. Do you mean ‚ÄòU‚Äôs‚Äôs laws change‚Äô?
4556,<|emo_surprise|> i got the impression that she was feeling pretty amazed at herself and she said it was not the first time she had done something funny
4558,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, it‚Äôs the same person who‚Äôs been posting on here for a few months. Tell them to stop being such fucking douchebags."
4559,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]! We still luv u guys
4560,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] you didn't? Yeah ok guess I should stop reading
4561,<|emo_surprise|> i feel so overwhelmed now
4562,"<|emo_surprise|> And don't forget about the ""tourISM""!"
4563,<|emo_surprise|> i feel completely overwhelmed with all of this
4565,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] oh my gosh
4566,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow no wonder they call him the ""No-trash-box-for-anime"" guy"
4567,<|emo_surprise|> Omg. What a crazy story. She saved my life. She is an amazing and kind human being.
4568,<|emo_surprise|> That's honestly incredible OP. What a steal that jersey was
4569,<|emo_surprise|> What did she just type? I'm in tears.
4570,<|emo_surprise|> wow the lack of remorse from the man
4572,<|emo_surprise|> Oh noooo. They are turning this into a [RELIGION] religion thing... I can't believe she would single out a faith for special treatment like that.
4573,<|emo_surprise|> Omg that's yummy
4574,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] a compliment!
4575,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! One of my all-time favorite films. This is good news for me!
4576,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh no, the terrible news for her...is that she will never be able to father a child."
4577,<|emo_surprise|> Oh god the YT vids are garbage ahaha
4578,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] no
4579,<|emo_surprise|> ohhhhh that
4580,"<|emo_surprise|> Thanks, I hate it."
4581,"<|emo_surprise|> The third sentence should read ‚Äúthe third was a stupid one‚Äù instead of ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a paranoid one‚Äù, sorry."
4582,<|emo_surprise|> i will put my hand on your shoulder and feel my eyes open looking at me that s what im saying and thats the feeling i think i was wanting
4583,<|emo_surprise|> I had some pretty bad diarrhea right after I ate my last morsel of pizza. I'm really just wondering what the deal was with the colostomy bag on there.
4584,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how his arm is that. O.O
4585,<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs crazy that this sub has it‚Äôs own unique voice on here.
4586,<|emo_surprise|> i feel curious about the world and sometimes i wonder how things work
4587,<|emo_surprise|> My nightmare is having an iphone.
4590,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like a shocked little child
4591,"<|emo_surprise|> He's still mad about 9/11. Like everyones except [NAME], but he's just gotten a lot easier to deal with."
4593,<|emo_surprise|> im going to give it a go as i feel more adventurous more adventurous and want to take a trip back to the north west and beyond
4594,<|emo_surprise|> This is why Reddit hates women.
4595,"<|emo_surprise|> Oof, sorry that they're downvoted to hell with this."
4598,<|emo_surprise|> Is there a video of doing this? I thought I'd hit the streets ofSaskatchewan but this is the first time I actually have.
4599,<|emo_surprise|> i feel so blessed that so many people think i am just another fat girl who can get away with being so self indulgent
4600,<|emo_surprise|> i think it s a bit strange
4601,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that was...sad. "
4602,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I love how you can relate to her! I wish I had told you sooner!"
4603,"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, it was only yesterday that I realized I was watching the same channel that did those originalizations."
4604,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised the house's beenarped that much.
4605,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, they actually said they liked it"
4607,<|emo_surprise|> Well shit im surprised taiwan hasn't had a presence there for some time now.
4608,<|emo_surprise|> i don t know any but i can tell what a person is feeling from the way they smile and even if i can not describe it in words
4609,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I didn't even know that came up.
4610,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised she wasn‚Äôt more offended
4611,<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs so amazing how [NAME] is not afraid to talk about anything
4613,<|emo_surprise|> i would also see this but i really know how to explain this to someone it makes me wonder how it will feel you might have read it in a different way if it happened to you
4614,<|emo_surprise|> Wow she's a sex symbol too.
4615,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a little shocked that i have never heard of this so amazing person
4616,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling quite impressed with myself as of late
4617,<|emo_surprise|> You guys are so right-wing you've convinced me you're a conspiracy theorist!
4619,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling quite surprised that the school hasn t told us
4620,<|emo_surprise|> Wtf was that
4621,"<|emo_surprise|> I honestly, I couldn‚Äôt be more pleased with this move."
4623,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] you are having a field day with your swear word cloud base today!
4624,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling pretty surprised that there are so many people on reddit who are willing to give up their personal safety for a piece of internet karma
4625,<|emo_surprise|> im also feeling a bit overwhelmed
4626,<|emo_surprise|> I'm shocked more people don't know this.
4627,<|emo_surprise|> Ahhh so you're a cuck
4628,"<|emo_surprise|> How is that not illegal? I mean, clearly the judge thought it was legal, but it could be abused to tip the scales in favor of the diner."
4629,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] damn are you [NAME]!
4630,<|emo_surprise|> I actually love all the threads about it but he's so young it kind of shocks me how much control people have.
4631,<|emo_surprise|> Omg I'm crying rn [NAME].
4632,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG dad, she's turning 15 this year! /s"
4633,<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit is that real? I thought he‚Äôs just exaggerating
4634,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh it‚Äôs you again! I‚Äôm not talking about politics, I just really like your style! Try your new style some more!"
4635,<|emo_surprise|> OMG I didn't know [NAME] used to do such a thing.
4636,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my god. He finally got it.
4637,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] can‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs been called up
4638,<|emo_surprise|> Just made a funny connection between these two pics.. super weird
4639,<|emo_surprise|> She had such a gorgeous baby!
4640,"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is really just shocked that everyone thinks he can play, and is surprised people are surprised that he's not fully recovered from injury"
4641,<|emo_surprise|> What is with all the [NAME] clapping. That's so disgusting.
4643,<|emo_surprise|> How?! How did you get such terrible taste!
4644,<|emo_surprise|> i really don't know what happened to me but i know that something happened to me when i was in for a break
4647,<|emo_surprise|> This is like the 3rd repost of this. Now is some good fucking content
4648,<|emo_surprise|> What's weird
4649,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is the only one to ever say it has been a good career.
4651,<|emo_surprise|> Wow.. You definitely did it
4652,<|emo_surprise|> oh i didn't even realize I had clicked a picture and now I'm mad

4657,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I think you've got me there
4659,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, your posts on that sub are absolutely amazing"
4660,"<|emo_surprise|> Ahhhhh, my [NAME] "
4661,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised the man filming didn‚Äôt get doused with lighter fluid.
4662,<|emo_surprise|> There are worse things tho...
4663,<|emo_surprise|> What a valuable experience!!
4664,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow that‚Äôs so generous
4665,"<|emo_surprise|> So did mine! I'm now one myself! Hope this becomes a thing, it helps me a lot!"
4666,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh look, it's a watermark! How incredibly infuriating"
4667,<|emo_surprise|> i thought this was weird and didn t feel shocked at this news
4668,"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah, the game was a fucking trainwreck"
4669,<|emo_surprise|> Whoa [NAME] is actually a weirdo.
4670,"<|emo_surprise|> This is a lot to take in, but I‚Äôm getting a lot more used to the process. The good news is I feel completely relieved"
4671,<|emo_surprise|> Ouch ouch it just broke

4684,<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is just... wow
4685,<|emo_surprise|> Damn I am glad I grew up killing infants at hospitals rather than a college course load...
4686,<|emo_surprise|> I was surprised to see them all in the same sentence.
4687,"<|emo_surprise|> What makes this even better is that [NAME] was 5'11"""
4688,<|emo_surprise|> Damn. Is that who wrote that. LOL
4689,<|emo_surprise|> He‚Äôs almost 5 feet 9! And still driving like he‚Äôs the owner! The idiot!
4690,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is a guy that makes me laugh out loud at how insane these players are.
4691,<|emo_surprise|> So...yikes
4692,<|emo_surprise|> Weird flex by [NAME] but ok
4693,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I'm almost there lol lol"
4694,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, what a surprise!"
4695,"<|emo_surprise|> I am surprised everyone didn't read this, especially since the title wasn't exactly a ""prove it sucks"" article."
4696,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I'm a little late posting this but I'm really glad you called it. I really liked it
4697,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is amazing. Good for you, man."
4699,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised the car didn't catch fire
4700,<|emo_surprise|> That's an amazingly bad list

4705,<|emo_surprise|> A surprising number of people don't know either.
4707,<|emo_surprise|> i feel really amazed because in the past about every five minutes i would hear a story about someone who could have done much more
4708,<|emo_surprise|> This is hilarious

4710,<|emo_surprise|> Ah fuck!

4731,"<|emo_surprise|> He could have said ""oh yeah well"" in case you were wondering"
4732,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] if you ever needed a man who could give you that trust and lift you up, husband..."
4733,<|emo_surprise|> OMG. I‚Äôm dying.

4780,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that is the first I‚Äôve heard of that. Wow what a crazy story.
4781,<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is good. What does it mean for the future? Are there any examples of people now doing good in the atheist/agnostics/agnostics sub? What would that have meant then? I can't help but wonder
4782,<|emo_surprise|> i feel very amazed at myself
4784,<|emo_surprise|> Oh the good old school 4 player coop. Personally never tried it myself but that's a great solo game I imagine.

4825,"<|emo_surprise|> How about ""I don't like losing so I'm going to win anyway!"""
4826,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you‚Äôre not as bad as you think you are!"

4917,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling overwhelmed by so much more and i am not even sure i will write for a while
4918,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling very overwhelmed and i hope that you could appreciate the many small actions i have taken that helped me keep it on a lower calories per day level
4919,<|emo_surprise|> I honestly couldn't care less about points total but wow I'm impressed at how many people didn't get the joke
4920,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] wept.
4921,<|emo_surprise|> oh of course it is

4960,<|emo_surprise|> i do feel overwhelmed a bit amp so i don t look forward to many conversations with people
4961,<|emo_surprise|> Damn I was so hoping for [NAME]. Is his hype real?
4962,<|emo_surprise|> Thanks I hate it
4963,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] looks like he lost a shoe like thats not the end of the world? That man is the end of the universe and I dont know how he survived it all
4964,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my god... his rookie year was actually better tho
4965,"<|emo_surprise|> He was born in Jersey, but he's lived stateside his entire adult life, and there's always been this sense of Weirdness about him"
4966,<|emo_surprise|> Oh. It seems that the username is being used to identify a child abuse ring run by [NAME].
4968,<|emo_surprise|> Wow she's really moody. I mean just look at her.
4969,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what he was thinking :(
4970,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] this is so cool! i wonder where she got that idea from üôÑ
4971,"<|emo_surprise|> Ahhh another version of this joke - I think it dates back to at the very least the episode ""The Last Man on Earth""."

4974,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh!!!!!!!
4975,"<|emo_surprise|> oh, [NAME]"

5004,<|emo_surprise|> Oh! Is that it?! I'm sorry!
5005,<|emo_surprise|> Lol the comment you just made was more appropriate for /r/Kotaku In Depth or the mods that delete comments.
5006,<|emo_surprise|> That's a weird way of spelling Disenchanted
5007,<|emo_surprise|> Oh so it really is true
5008,<|emo_surprise|> So happy for you and your lovely family!!! We will keep you posted if anything comes of it.
5011,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Didn‚Äôt expect the comments. Never would have thought to see that in a gaming context. What a disgusting thing to say.
5012,<|emo_surprise|> This is good
5013,<|emo_surprise|> This. What an idea
5014,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow that's just... wow. And I thought this was just ""okay"""

5021,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh man, we could have gone with them"
5022,<|emo_surprise|> i had the unfortunate fortune to be living in a somewhat isolated part of west virginia where no one knows anything about the other 99% of the country but my own family is a tightly packed pack of surprises
5023,<|emo_surprise|> You're gonna die tonight you weak minded piece of shit. Stay strong m8
5024,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh dear, the hypocrisy"
5025,<|emo_surprise|> That and I just thought this guy was hilarious.

5047,<|emo_surprise|> i feel shocked and appalled that this man should have touched me so caustically
5048,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling a little skeptical about a lot of this
5049,<|emo_surprise|> This makes me so happy! One day I'll be able to fly!
5050,<|emo_surprise|> Weird he didn‚Äôt say ‚Äòhim‚Äô since he was literally being supportive. Was there a reason you couldn‚Äôt do this or maybe it was just because he‚Äôs a stranger?
5051,<|emo_surprise|> Ah the high life... Must be sweet.
5052,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you had me at ""wait no this is funny"""
5053,<|emo_surprise|> I did this for a month!
5054,<|emo_surprise|> The other day I accidentally got stuck in a puddle on my car. I was driving backwards and ended up almost hitting a tree.
5055,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]? Oh my gosh.
5056,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, I never even knew about that, thanks for the info, I don't know if I'm doing it wrong but I may want to check it out"
5057,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you sure got me "
5059,<|emo_surprise|> Wow the amount of dumb these people are. It‚Äôs pretty astounding.
5060,<|emo_surprise|> Hahahah. She sounds like a super model to me!
5061,"<|emo_surprise|> i also thought to myself, my head hurt now"
5062,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh shitttt. I forgot about the pizza bit, but wow you made me a very special cake for today! "
5063,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that‚Äôs great! So many good years in there. I‚Äôm 30 but still can‚Äôt believe my luck :)
5064,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, thanks for this! I was wondering what it was like to be this crazy"
5065,<|emo_surprise|> I think I‚Äôve seen this before
5066,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] i forgot about the triumphant music video from [NAME]!
5068,<|emo_surprise|> Wow you‚Äôre really just showing your age..
5069,<|emo_surprise|> No wonder then that such a high percentage of people in both the U.S. and Canada fall into one of these camps.
5070,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] the shame.
5071,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised they got him
5073,<|emo_surprise|> What is worrying me is that this is happening less and less.
5074,"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] has impressed since he broke into the scene and impressed me the most at SHTF events. I still think there are more talented, stronger and more experienced players from throughout the scene that can challenge him."
5075,<|emo_surprise|> Wow a Superbowl appearance by [NAME]
5076,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow the guy is Scottish, not Welsh"
5077,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I‚Äôm so glad [NAME] is a porn star
5078,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if the government would fine her for doing something that isn't illegal.
5079,<|emo_surprise|> omg no I could cry at this
5080,<|emo_surprise|> oh ok nevermind
5081,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. Is that true? Have you told anyone yet?
5082,<|emo_surprise|> I cannot believe he got it while getting manhandled on the floor by two players! Very disloyal.
5083,<|emo_surprise|> i can feel how he can feel terrified
5084,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]...I'm lost here
5085,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, great news bro! Keep up the good work! Can't wait to hear from you in the coming weeks! üíú"
5086,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] do you mean www in Canada? Because I couldn't find an ""in Canada"" for anywhere."
5088,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm dumbstruck your mom actually called you mom. This really isn‚Äôt unexpected. Good work
5089,<|emo_surprise|> Ah! I thought the same
5090,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I thought she just got super serious about being a mom.
5091,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] that's so good.
5092,"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is scared out there, looks like he's pulling for the throwback throwback jersey they wore back in the day."
5093,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that's awesome. Keep up the great work!"
5094,<|emo_surprise|> Omg!!! The shirt is directly aimed at my face!!! üò´
5095,<|emo_surprise|> This is terrifying
5096,<|emo_surprise|> Wow what a cataclysm
5097,<|emo_surprise|> The amount of hype around this is insane.
5099,"<|emo_surprise|> Lol my [NAME] just posted the same thing a year ago, why do all these people keep coming out SoÔøΩtf"
5100,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised they could live with themselves without her help.
5101,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I‚Äôm so glad the shooter died."
5102,<|emo_surprise|> I'm shocked by how good [NAME] is at hiding his true colors. Probably more than [NAME].
5103,<|emo_surprise|> What a surprise irl
5105,<|emo_surprise|> i am so happy the media ignored that i felt more than a little skeptical about it
5106,<|emo_surprise|> That's a beautiful cake. Did she have a stigmata? I'm so shocked they didn't make one of them a head.
5108,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] should be happy he's playing like this.
5109,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I went online and did some digging and have found nothing. What a weird thing to say"
5110,<|emo_surprise|> So much confetti
5111,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like im only supporting myself through these flashbacks and i didnt have a lot of them either before
5112,"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is a guy. Also: ""I'll show you how to make a dildo"" "
5113,<|emo_surprise|> Whoa this is really creepy
5115,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you really missed the point. I hope I'm wrong but I really hope she does not pursue the show after this."
5116,<|emo_surprise|> > he got lucky somehow! OP is a bony old man
5117,<|emo_surprise|> im not feeling all that impressed by the whole group
5118,"<|emo_surprise|> The other day, I was like ""I can't believe [NAME] won"""
5119,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I wouldnt be shocked if this happens all the time.
5120,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I'm glad you made it. I know this looks really strange but dude it's worth it to do it right
5121,<|emo_surprise|> i wonder how i feel when i see people who aren t aware of or care about all the amazing things about their lives
5122,<|emo_surprise|> Who made this???
5123,"<|emo_surprise|> Ooh, you know him? Oh jeez, you're lucky."
5125,"<|emo_surprise|> There might even be a ""YOU DON'T WIN"" mode where you have to lose to beat the best players from each city at every map?"
5126,<|emo_surprise|> No wonder they call it a turd burger.
5128,<|emo_surprise|> What an evening.
5129,"<|emo_surprise|> You know, [NAME] and [NAME] are two of the only actors who have ever been casted in major motion picture motion picture. And to think it's been more than 20 years."
5130,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that's just... Wow."
5132,<|emo_surprise|> i feel youre so sweet and so honest youre so strong and determined youre so good and why would i change my mind so easily
5133,<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs an amazing feeling... Like your heart just melted
5134,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs a good point. I‚Äôm scared the other team‚Äôs better
5136,"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah, what a surprise I never saw coming."
5137,<|emo_surprise|> The surprise wasn‚Äôt in the title...
5138,<|emo_surprise|> wow. you're quite the romantic...
5139,<|emo_surprise|> How interesting.
5140,<|emo_surprise|> So you're a [NAME] or what?
5141,<|emo_surprise|> You're saying you trust me?! You really didn't trust him at all?!
5142,"<|emo_surprise|> Well, they didn't take any pictures but apparently he still managed to make a funny faces"
5143,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, [NAME]!"
5144,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] this is awful
5145,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] was a little surprised as well. I feel safe on this sub.
5147,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] she dead
5149,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh!!!!!! üòÇ you're so right!
5150,<|emo_surprise|> The comment was so cringy it made me literally crack up.
5151,<|emo_surprise|> i really didnt have a clue what other peoples thoughts r on this until i read about people who have died and watched their lives completelyURN out
5152,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I'm surprised the truck didn't crush him."
5153,<|emo_surprise|> I've got no clue what they're talking about. My posts were once about this exact subject matter.
5154,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, [NAME] is a tough one to describe. "
5155,<|emo_surprise|> Damn it!
5158,<|emo_surprise|> This is one of the weirdest I've seen...
5159,<|emo_surprise|> O.oohhhh... there goes the whole thing
5160,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh yah, a suit"
5161,<|emo_surprise|> Oh god [NAME] has a fucking gun oh fuck
5163,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! Thanks to everyone who posted tips about this! You are all heroes!
5164,"<|emo_surprise|> And no, it isn't a $20 martini!"
5165,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if she's the type who gets really worked up over anything that isn't her idea first.
5166,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised he didn't say that about the New Year's Eve games being cancelled
5168,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling a little overwhelmed im trying to put my energy into things where i can truly shape myself while the boys are busy running
5169,<|emo_surprise|> I have no idea what the new format will look like but either way it will be interesting to watch
5171,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling pretty impressed of themselves so far
5172,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling a little stunned because it is not any form of self driving car
5173,<|emo_surprise|> Oh heck oh fricking
5175,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I've never seen so many deleted comments.
5176,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised that they had enough players to field the whole team, considering that they only field 3D players."
5178,<|emo_surprise|> oh wow omg
5179,<|emo_surprise|> Oh it's free with prime now.
5180,"<|emo_surprise|> Lol wow, you are quite the romantic... "
5181,<|emo_surprise|> Who would have thought that it would be this simple!
5182,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised they're complaining about how expensive it is to rent on the coasts, considering the average cost of a 2 bedroom single in the Bay Area is about $2k."
5183,<|emo_surprise|> She's really just scared
5184,<|emo_surprise|> I want to be able to give my children a loving home without thinking about the things that have kept them there.
5185,<|emo_surprise|> Hahahah what
5186,<|emo_surprise|> You're a weirdo
5187,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, the content of the video is more or less the same as posts on r/tworeddit... kind of worrying..."
5188,<|emo_surprise|> Oh shit it‚Äôs totally me!
5189,<|emo_surprise|> It's a funny thing. Most Redditors live in a bubble.
5190,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm hearing a lot of names and titles this morning as reported by r/nba lol
5191,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh look, some text"
5192,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, thanks. I read about the fire department cleaning out their drawers and found them empty!"
5193,<|emo_surprise|> I am so happy for you; nothing could ever replace that.
5194,<|emo_surprise|> OMG she reminds me of Ginger from Ginger Snaps! So sweetüíó
5196,<|emo_surprise|> Wow what if the only tool the police officer had was a hammer and a hatchet. You wouldn't have much of an argument then.
5197,<|emo_surprise|> Omg no way she must really have no idea. How did you avoid a brain freeze by not shaking her??
5198,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] I love this. So brave of them all to do this. We can all use a good laugh now and again.
5199,<|emo_surprise|> It would be interesting to see what it'll be like to have to wear something other than swim trunks for a while...
5200,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I wonder what that is"
5201,<|emo_surprise|> Omg what a nightmare. I hope she can wake up soon because this will be a nightmare from tomorrow.
5202,<|emo_surprise|> The ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to a party‚Äù button just to remind me
5203,"<|emo_surprise|> I had a similar thought! So many good books out there, but I can remember looking for any reference or anything to help me read them...."
5204,<|emo_surprise|> My new favourite video
5205,<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is the first I‚Äôve heard of this. I‚Äôm so shocked!
5206,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, yeah, forgot about that."
5207,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I‚Äôm so sorry that happened. You are a hero.
5208,"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, we‚Äôre playing out of our minds and throwing numbers around. "
5209,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, totally forgot about it! And thank you for the update! :)"
5210,<|emo_surprise|> i feel funny and weird
5211,<|emo_surprise|> How does it work? I have a 1 TB drives a 1 TB hard drive. That seems pretty generous.
5212,<|emo_surprise|> >and there's even a few that genuinely love reading Lol
5213,<|emo_surprise|> Yup that was what I was thinking. Glad that was off my mind lol.
5214,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] aww yes
5215,<|emo_surprise|> How absolutely disgusting it was to see [NAME] and [NAME] at the same time.
5216,<|emo_surprise|> im starting to feel overwhelmed
5217,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! Didn't expect it to be this crazy
5218,"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah no it's been the best I can do, so... Sorry for late response"
5219,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a little dazed and confused and slightly amazed really
5221,<|emo_surprise|> Wow... Your mom was a model.
5222,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, my gosh. I thought I was the only one. I thought I was the only one who thought it was okay to give a 10 for the blind spot test."
5223,<|emo_surprise|> Ah shit....
5224,"<|emo_surprise|> I want to say I'm shocked, because I have no idea what to say."
5225,<|emo_surprise|> He also had the most accurate and longest arms that I have ever seen. Feels so lucky
5226,<|emo_surprise|> Why is she crying??
5227,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, call customer service, they might actually want to help this poor woman out."
5228,<|emo_surprise|> Lmao you sound upset. Stay warm and sane.
5229,<|emo_surprise|> Wow so much younger but i feel like he's really young for his age range üòÇ
5230,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling very hesitant in writing again
5231,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm just SHOOK so hard by that, I think I'm going to die from embarrassment tonight"
5232,<|emo_surprise|> I'm a bit surprised they haven't done it yet tbh
5233,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] this is gonna be great...
5234,<|emo_surprise|> I thought they were all friends except for two but they actually ended up killing off one
5238,<|emo_surprise|> i feel amazed just thinking it
5239,"<|emo_surprise|> Hey, at least it doesn't use cookies."
5240,<|emo_surprise|> He actually said that?!
5241,<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe he said that.
5242,<|emo_surprise|> Whoa. I love how people downvote you just because they ‚Äúd never even come across the subreddit first.
5243,<|emo_surprise|> How is it terrible? I'm new to the scene. I just moved here from SFW. All the people I know swear by it!
5244,<|emo_surprise|> What a bummer! She lost it at 2:10!! ( Remember how short it was )
5247,<|emo_surprise|> This is so cool.
5248,<|emo_surprise|> What a thot*
5250,<|emo_surprise|> I am shocked that your mum doesn't know your ‚Äúbirthday‚Äù!
5251,<|emo_surprise|> i feel quite surprised when i hear of this
5252,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I like this a lot
5253,<|emo_surprise|> No problem. Glad you like it
5254,<|emo_surprise|> im actually feeling very overwhelmed
5255,"<|emo_surprise|> Ah yes, my apologies, I am looking into it. Thanks for the heads up!"
5256,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, is that a real article?"
5257,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, did not expect that to be a thing, was not paying attention, and thought it was just the iPhone 6 running webOS"
5258,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, y'all are heroes "
5259,<|emo_surprise|> i feel more amazed and amazed that people actually do things
5260,<|emo_surprise|> i feel amazed this is happening
5261,"<|emo_surprise|> My first thought was ""what a waste of plastic""."
5262,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised not a fan of either team let alone both.
5263,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh that's so interesting to hear, I would be shocked if he could talk"
5264,<|emo_surprise|> Omg is this [NAME]??
5265,<|emo_surprise|> i feel suddenly very funny
5266,"<|emo_surprise|> Lol, I think I heard her name right."
5267,<|emo_surprise|> What a steal that was for your album art
5268,<|emo_surprise|> What?! That's awful. Hopefully you enjoyed it!
5269,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I could have gone a long way without reading 3 books.
5270,<|emo_surprise|> This is why I‚Äôm retirement planning. I can‚Äôt imagine living anywhere else.
5271,<|emo_surprise|> i feel surprised and confused
5272,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] IS HELL OF A listener
5273,<|emo_surprise|> What? What did I just read?
5275,<|emo_surprise|> OMG I want to see them together
5276,<|emo_surprise|> This is the first time I‚Äôve ever seen him act this bad.
5278,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that was a bop song
5279,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. What a surprise. Big shock to be sure. But a welcome one
5280,<|emo_surprise|> Oh yesssss but no
5281,<|emo_surprise|> omg what a nightmare
5282,<|emo_surprise|> I love how she started crying...
5283,<|emo_surprise|> Oh so it's not just the head shot? Omg I'm so dumb
5284,<|emo_surprise|> I'm shocked they still make them these
5285,<|emo_surprise|> You just need to be there.
5286,<|emo_surprise|> This is so touching tbh
5287,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh.
5288,<|emo_surprise|> i feel surprised and disturbed
5289,<|emo_surprise|> What a surprise i wasnt expecting this to be a thing. What are you looking at?
5290,<|emo_surprise|> Yeah I mean the dude has a pretty big social media presence so I didn't think he was that toxic
5291,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME]... you're gone for good
5292,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, congratulations :O)"
5293,<|emo_surprise|> No. That's worse.
5294,"<|emo_surprise|> Ah, the good old days"
5295,<|emo_surprise|> Ah yeah I forgot about the [NAME] dustup that took place last year.
5296,<|emo_surprise|> Wow so this is what it's come to.
5297,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, [NAME] I thought I was the only one who went through this!"
5298,<|emo_surprise|> My daughter told me years ago that she had no idea they were fighting... I have a feeling this will be a bitter end
5299,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, he might actually get [NAME] back "
5301,<|emo_surprise|> I am actually surprised this didn't get more attention.
5302,<|emo_surprise|> Damn...he actually did
5303,<|emo_surprise|> i think about it i feel a little dazed and overwhelmed
5304,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling pretty hopeful i ll see this guy next week but in the mean time if you would like to go meet him for a beer or another drink just let me know
5305,<|emo_surprise|> I'm just wondering where inUT's offense they lost this focus.
5306,<|emo_surprise|> Oh! I saw that!
5307,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that‚Äôs terrible. What is wrong with you?
5308,<|emo_surprise|> oh wow
5309,<|emo_surprise|> Omg no way! How come these people have it out for so many?
5310,<|emo_surprise|> OMG I didn't know that had happened before. üòÇ
5311,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, the reaction to this was hilarious."
5312,<|emo_surprise|> What a crazy thing to say!
5313,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow that‚Äôs a really low bar to clear, you‚Äôre only minimum of 20 years old, still got until the age of 21."
5314,<|emo_surprise|> What? That‚Äôs not what the article said? Is it January?
5315,<|emo_surprise|> She‚Äôs just going to keep getting smaller.. Haha
5316,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised nobody posted a Meat thread yet
5317,<|emo_surprise|> i just can t stop feeling amazed
5319,<|emo_surprise|> oh [NAME]!!!
5320,"<|emo_surprise|> wow, that movie was awesome. did you see the ending? it had a twist!"
5321,<|emo_surprise|> i feel curious as to how a group of people come out from under the earth together
5322,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised he hasn't already.
5323,<|emo_surprise|> I can‚Äôt believe [NAME] actually said this.
5324,<|emo_surprise|> ohhhhh I know
5325,<|emo_surprise|> I saw it today on netflix!! I am surprised not too many people saw it lol. I think they were probably impressed by the quality of it
5326,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, that's so awesome, you two seem nice!"
5327,<|emo_surprise|> Damn this is dope. You should check it out
5328,<|emo_surprise|> omg I love it
5329,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling impressed that there isnt a single picture of her with her phone
5330,<|emo_surprise|> He‚Äôs creepy
5331,<|emo_surprise|> i feel overwhelmed for you all the time and can t take it
5332,<|emo_surprise|> The first 4 replies were hilarious. What a load of old shite.
5333,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] no. Not the joke.
5334,<|emo_surprise|> i dont think i have ever been excited by a person who i really can t bring myself to have feelings for
5335,<|emo_surprise|> It's the worst thing ever.
5336,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I think I've ever written that before
5337,<|emo_surprise|> That sounds like wild child abuse. One parent could be so extreme I can't believe it.
5338,<|emo_surprise|> Oh it would be something like this.
5339,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that literally just broke my heart"
5341,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] I LOVE YOU
5342,<|emo_surprise|> Omg I can‚Äôt believe [NAME] got let go
5343,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I see it now
5344,<|emo_surprise|> I've been looking for this. I'm shocked. This is the first I've seen of her using them.
5346,<|emo_surprise|> You're ugly
5348,"<|emo_surprise|> There must be a new word for this. ""Botoxification"" sounds far more disgusting than ""oxidation""."
5349,<|emo_surprise|> i feel strange for loving something that makes me feel like no one was listening to me
5350,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that‚Äôs not okay
5351,<|emo_surprise|> This is the first time I‚Äôve been this happy in four years
5352,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, who among us hasn't seen this movie a few times."
5354,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] that's so awesome!
5355,<|emo_surprise|> Omg that's awesome i hope your wife helps you out
5356,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] looks like he did when he was a kid.
5358,<|emo_surprise|> i have to imagine what that must feel like im thinking wow that is amazing
5359,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME]....
5360,<|emo_surprise|> Wow this sub is a real joke.
5361,<|emo_surprise|> I thought everyone hated him.
5362,<|emo_surprise|> That is honestly amazing. Even with the added background music it still manages to be haunting.
5363,<|emo_surprise|> I love [NAME]
5364,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like im going to have a hell of a time trying to look this good
5366,"<|emo_surprise|> Thanks for the update OP! That's so good to hear, glad I asked."
5367,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised he hasn't, but still surprised I haven't seen it."
5368,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] it really IS like that sometimes.
5369,"<|emo_surprise|> Omg, we need to find this brendan stoner."
5370,"<|emo_surprise|> This is one of the longer responses I've seen on here, but it makes me look smart :D"
5371,<|emo_surprise|> Oh god it's on my wall just waiting to be triggered
5372,"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, that's dark"
5373,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] i see this I fucking love this
5375,<|emo_surprise|> Omg! I was gonna say that...
5376,<|emo_surprise|> I did not know she was interested in [NAME] lol
5377,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I‚Äôm so glad she did
5378,<|emo_surprise|> That is so awesome!! I‚Äôd be ecstatic to be part of that!
5379,"<|emo_surprise|> It was amazing to watch. Not only did he not back down, he seemed determined not to back down"
5380,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I'm so sorry"
5381,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised [NAME] let her post that
5382,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like ive had a blessed experience being here
5384,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Never thought I'd say this.
5385,"<|emo_surprise|> Well, she was quite clearly pregnant and appeared to give no other sign or indication she was pregnant."
5386,<|emo_surprise|> i got out that was good and feeling pretty dazed
5387,<|emo_surprise|> That would be an experience I would never forget
5388,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. I see what you did there.
5389,"<|emo_surprise|> Well, a lot of people did!"
5390,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you‚Äôre so close"
5391,"<|emo_surprise|> wow, more power to you!"
5392,<|emo_surprise|> Wow so.
5393,"<|emo_surprise|> I think the worst of these is a combination of both, because the former is completely false and incredibly telling."
5394,<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs weird that he gets to hit 20+ threes a year but can shoot a woeful 39?
5395,<|emo_surprise|> Omg lol
5396,<|emo_surprise|> Omg no...yikes...yikes
5397,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what this baby will look like when he is 2 years old
5399,<|emo_surprise|> Wow i didn't know [NAME] was still alive
5400,<|emo_surprise|> I really can't imagine not having a job in rock or roll that you enjoy.
5401,<|emo_surprise|> OMG I had a feeling they were being sarcastic.
5403,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. That‚Äôs really interesting!
5404,<|emo_surprise|> i feel very overwhelmed amp exhausted and im actually in a great mood
5406,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, your sister is incel"
5407,<|emo_surprise|> She's passed away.
5408,<|emo_surprise|> She looked like something straight out of Dr Who.
5409,<|emo_surprise|> Ah heck oh oh no no no no
5410,<|emo_surprise|> It's so damn funny.
5412,<|emo_surprise|> I did not know [NAME] disliked Pittsburgh so much
5413,<|emo_surprise|> What a strange thing to find yourself in
5415,<|emo_surprise|> I'm not surprised. He's had a bizarre career
5416,<|emo_surprise|> i began feeling very overwhelmed and overwhelmed by just the idea of getting married i started to feel as if i would die
5418,"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah, he should be. This is the wrong decision. He's old, and his life is a lot better. He should go back to his parents. "
5419,"<|emo_surprise|> What a weird thing to say, actually. "
5420,"<|emo_surprise|> Weird, he looks just like [NAME] from Persona"
5421,<|emo_surprise|> OMG they are glitched to work with older generation accounts..
5422,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, you are quite the romantic!"
5423,<|emo_surprise|> They just came and told us to leave.
5424,<|emo_surprise|> Oh boy. The fine Print states that you can request a recall if you die during the 5 days following the due date.
5425,<|emo_surprise|> Omg a partridge in a pear tree!!!
5426,<|emo_surprise|> I was wondering what you‚Äôre bitching about.
5427,<|emo_surprise|> Omg!! Its hannibal cooper
5428,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, now I have something to talk about"
5429,<|emo_surprise|> OMG she took it OFF!
5430,<|emo_surprise|> i actually feeling kinda strange
5431,<|emo_surprise|> i always feel shocked when i talk to people about it
5432,"<|emo_surprise|> If you want to insult [NAME] or anything then cool. But if you want to actually do anything then you need to get the fuck out, you're not the right kind of guy and you're a total shill For our [NAME]. "
5433,<|emo_surprise|> Lmao no fun allowed
5435,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, did you report her to the police?"
5436,<|emo_surprise|> i really feel stunned from this post
5437,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] what are you talking about
5438,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what that feels like. Very strong emotions I can relate to.
5439,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I am very new to the club (appearing on this episode) but am very excited to try this season"
5440,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you sure know your stuff."
5441,"<|emo_surprise|> How did I get into a adults game? I didn't grow up playing card games, that would be weird."
5442,<|emo_surprise|> OMG... Daddy [NAME]!
5443,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I'm watching old enemys and I thought the daddy had a baseball bat
5444,<|emo_surprise|> i feel strange reading about this
5445,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like it was in there something there
5446,<|emo_surprise|> What a nice birthday wish.
5447,<|emo_surprise|> He just looks genuinely surprised
5448,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I didn't know there were more racial/ethnic minority players in Source Filmmaker than in previous entries. Not even close
5449,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs like... three times more likely to happen than not being a virgin
5450,"<|emo_surprise|> Really wow, what a steal that was"
5451,<|emo_surprise|> How? I don‚Äôt even remember the last time I watched it
5452,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, if he had a kid this age, he would probably end up with you."
5453,<|emo_surprise|> i was feeling overwhelmed by the weight of it all i thought would have made my brain hurt and not quite done but i have
5454,<|emo_surprise|> What a funny story
5455,<|emo_surprise|> i remember feeling surprised about the scale of the damage
5456,<|emo_surprise|> oh wow this is gonna blow my mind
5457,"<|emo_surprise|> Lol, I didn't even know he had a YouTube channel"
5458,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling a little wimpy at the moment
5459,<|emo_surprise|> Hey just noticed I already posted a picture of this shirt the guy is obviously in his late 20s so I can see where he can fool you for some money
5460,<|emo_surprise|> I'm a little surprised that's not a thing yet /s
5461,<|emo_surprise|> oh [NAME] how awful
5462,<|emo_surprise|> Yeah he‚Äôs a bit of a nutter.
5465,"<|emo_surprise|> No, stop. No one to blame here but myself. "
5466,"<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if that means he's not ""blessed"", even after he betrayed you"
5467,<|emo_surprise|> I'm honestly surprised they haven't done that yet tbh I'm also very familiar with the situation with Netflix.
5468,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that is pretty disturbing. I thought I was talking about the US, was very surprised"
5469,"<|emo_surprise|> What a joke. A very successful one with very serious consequences. Thank [NAME] for the laughs, I think. "
5472,<|emo_surprise|> i feel more surprised and shocked and worried and disappointed than i did when i first read it
5473,<|emo_surprise|> Hmmm... interesting
5474,<|emo_surprise|> Oh yeah that
5475,<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe they let him post that
5477,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, he got cut?"
5478,<|emo_surprise|> So edgy.
5479,<|emo_surprise|> i feel surprised still
5480,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised he didn't say his office wants help, and that the victims are his own staff."
5481,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, so true it hurts."
5482,<|emo_surprise|> i can‚Äôt believe i was so desperate to know all about what happened to her
5483,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my wow! I thought I was the only one! Thanks for sharing.
5485,<|emo_surprise|> She said that? You're still weirded out?
5486,<|emo_surprise|> Damn that‚Äôs a big F from me ü§£
5487,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you‚Äôre the first person I‚Äôm hearing about this. Thanks for sharing! Wow! "
5488,<|emo_surprise|> Who thought this comment could get any worse....
5489,<|emo_surprise|> oh my gosh i just watched it
5490,<|emo_surprise|> What a strange thing happened. Someone I really had a thing for fell in love with [NAME].
5491,"<|emo_surprise|> Ah, I'll be right back."
5492,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, now I think I'm going to get very excited when the dress-to-hide thing comes into play."
5493,<|emo_surprise|> What a gift
5494,"<|emo_surprise|> That's so amazing, I cannot believe you are telling the truth. Wow."
5495,<|emo_surprise|> Oh look at it
5496,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, my favorite artist just lost a double album.. RIP"
5497,<|emo_surprise|> That's so beautiful!
5498,<|emo_surprise|> Who tf did I just read?
5499,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs awesome to know! I‚Äôm glad you think it‚Äôs a good idea.
5500,<|emo_surprise|> This is the most accurate thing I have seen this year
5501,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised he doesn't have the n stick on him
5502,<|emo_surprise|> Wow if I were a suspect I would have gone on the run.
5505,<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit she's incredible
5506,<|emo_surprise|> i dont have a favorite for any of them but i feel pretty sure each one would receive more votes than me
5507,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] i could not be the only one who feels this way
5508,<|emo_surprise|> The comment was so tone deaf it was pathetic.
5509,<|emo_surprise|> im not the greatest when it comes to writing but i do know how it feels to be overwhelmed by emotion or that just comes with the job
5510,<|emo_surprise|> im still not feeling brave enough tell a friend how i feel and stop being ashamed
5512,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, I don't know. Are they in the bottom quartile or just above it? Seems about right."
5513,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] this is getting so crazy
5515,<|emo_surprise|> *The Daily Wire.* Lol.
5516,<|emo_surprise|> Oh of course! It just wouldn't work in the original but I think it does now! I hope you enjoy the new version as much as I enjoyed the original! All the best!
5517,<|emo_surprise|> i get that i am supposed to feel like a idiot for having been awake for such a long time and so often so early for that kind of feeling
5518,<|emo_surprise|> This is the first time I‚Äôve ever seen this
5519,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, is that really who [NAME] is?"
5520,<|emo_surprise|> Oh god [NAME] is on fire!!!
5521,<|emo_surprise|> I'll take it a as serious question. Sorry if I don't have an answer
5522,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I didn't see it...was just a picture of a shirt
5524,<|emo_surprise|> How many people knew this? I'm surprised he still has a job...
5525,<|emo_surprise|> Damn I'm tired
5527,<|emo_surprise|> i feel dazed and confused
5528,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, didn‚Äôt know about your Reddit account. Congrats on the clean bill of health!"
5529,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I didn‚Äôt notice that!!
5530,"<|emo_surprise|> If your an EBRO fan and not a result of the EBRO drama... Wow, sorry for confusion"
5531,<|emo_surprise|> i have been feeling a bit surprised by how easy it is to get a job done
5532,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. My heart!
5533,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, [NAME] this is good."
5534,<|emo_surprise|> i feel really surprised i didnt think of that
5536,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh god, what if [NAME] didn't have a different agent than him? Would he still be interested?"
5537,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I didn't know he used to dogging for payphones at McDonalds.
5538,"<|emo_surprise|> This is a good story! Well told, well done and it made me chuckle hard "
5539,<|emo_surprise|> Damn I want to go but am not sure what to do
5540,<|emo_surprise|> Oh stop it
5541,<|emo_surprise|> Wow did not know you can order directly from them? direct from them?
5543,<|emo_surprise|> Oh that's interesting
5544,<|emo_surprise|> i was able to take a moment to feel really amazed at how far i have come
5545,<|emo_surprise|> That seems pretty generous.
5546,<|emo_surprise|> How did you get in touch with them? You posted a pic of your new apartment on instagram
5547,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like a weirdo sometimes
5549,<|emo_surprise|> I would love for a team to take either [NAME] or [NAME] and essentially put [NAME] into a back of the net instead of [NAME] in a 3 goal game.
5551,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I didn't get it!
5552,<|emo_surprise|> Damn [NAME] damn
5553,<|emo_surprise|> i feel surprised at myself
5554,<|emo_surprise|> i was going back and forth between feeling amazed and dumb how quickly i realized these things could be a problem and how quickly im working on them
5555,<|emo_surprise|> I like this person.
5556,<|emo_surprise|> He lost it
5557,<|emo_surprise|> wow! this is a good list
5558,"<|emo_surprise|> No surprise, given the billionaire's close association with right-wing media."
5559,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what happened to this painting.
5561,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Now I am sad
5562,<|emo_surprise|> This is why im surprised Reddit doesn‚Äôt tightly constrain the types of pages that can and can‚Äôt have photos.
5564,<|emo_surprise|> This video made me smile. Thanks for sharing
5565,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] I was so looking forward to this! So much hype!
5566,<|emo_surprise|> i think i made the person who gave the key to a stranger feel really weird
5567,<|emo_surprise|> Weird how it does
5568,<|emo_surprise|> wow I have no idea who do these little boys work for
5569,<|emo_surprise|> OMG I can‚Äôt stand [NAME]
5570,<|emo_surprise|> How does it feel to lose to the that drafted you
5571,<|emo_surprise|> Well I'm not sure what I expected at all!
5572,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, there‚Äôs a twist! What a monster! "
5573,<|emo_surprise|> i can t remember the last time i cried in the presence of the lord
5574,<|emo_surprise|> Yikes. No wonder everyone hates him.
5576,"<|emo_surprise|> I thought you said it was all relative, that if you're still paying you'll see a rise next year."
5577,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh look, just in case he goes down, there's also this in the wild"
5578,<|emo_surprise|> That looks disgusting. Can't imagine thinking that's healthy.
5579,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I'm so sorry!"
5580,<|emo_surprise|> No wonder crime is going up if these morons are the ones doing the work.
5581,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I didn't know that button existed. Sorry for the mistake.
5582,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, this is great. Hopefully the guy involved is charged with multiple crimes."
5583,"<|emo_surprise|> And not one single one of them said **my god, we are so sorry**"
5584,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised [NAME] let her post that.
5586,"<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised [NAME] didn‚Äôt find a more appropriate catchphrase (e.g. ‚ÄúHey, my name is [NAME]) in his acceptance speech."
5587,<|emo_surprise|> My only minor fault is not reading this if you don‚Äôt watch anything else he does
5588,<|emo_surprise|> Damn I had no idea [NAME] was auary.
5589,<|emo_surprise|> No surprise as to who the real victim was
5590,<|emo_surprise|> Is that the only place I can get some? I‚Äôd rather than drive everywhere I need to!
5591,"<|emo_surprise|> It's a strange thing to be concerned about, I'm fairly certain."
5593,<|emo_surprise|> And he still doesn't know how much has changed
5594,<|emo_surprise|> Wow... This just oozes passive-agressiveness
5595,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, the level of denial the top boys reached was astonishing."
5597,<|emo_surprise|> wow he is... pretty stock standard
5598,<|emo_surprise|> The fact they went to McD's for the fries was unexpected.
5599,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is hot....
5600,<|emo_surprise|> oh [NAME] i forgot :3
5601,<|emo_surprise|> The one with the flowers is my favorite so I'm surprised [NAME] let it go
5602,<|emo_surprise|> i feel it s a surprise to learn that a person with my background and education has not experienced less
5603,<|emo_surprise|> Wow... You're quite the romantic...
5604,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] this is gonna go well
5605,<|emo_surprise|> I'm wondering how you did it...you need video?
5606,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I thought everyone hated it and I was completely wrong
5607,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling overwhelmed and i dont know why
5609,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Where did you get this idea for the poster? I thought [NAME] was only good with a little help from [NAME].
5610,<|emo_surprise|> *oh] [NAME] I thought I was the only one who thought that
5611,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like im almost going to cry tonight
5612,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised she could operate a suitcase
5613,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling a bit surprised
5614,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh! Your reddit name is exactly the same as [NAME]! This fucking machine!
5615,<|emo_surprise|> i feel as if a new miracle has suddenly occurred
5617,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh! You beat me to it!
5618,<|emo_surprise|> What a joke!!!
5619,<|emo_surprise|> OMG this cream cheese covered jackfruit burger looks yummy.
5621,<|emo_surprise|> Really surprised I had to come this far down.
5622,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like i am so overwhelmed with my life and that im finally seeing that its just not all that bad
5623,<|emo_surprise|> This is kinda creepy
5624,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] [NAME] I forgot about that. I was just pleased to see [NAME] doing well
5625,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, the degree in Aerospace engineering is probably the dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever heard about."
5626,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I can't believe you won
5627,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! That was fast
5628,<|emo_surprise|> OMG that's so sweet. I really appreciated that
5629,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, I feel your pain..."
5630,<|emo_surprise|> This is the first time I‚Äôve said this. Thank you so much for the support
5631,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling quite apprehensive but optimistic
5632,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, I'm so sorry!"
5633,<|emo_surprise|> i feel shocked that a kid was found guilty
5634,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh I thought this was an interview. Nope no, this is the shittastic trailer for the horror movie ""INSIDE""."
5635,<|emo_surprise|> Lol no wonder its cheaper there tbh
5636,"<|emo_surprise|> The weirdest part is that if she had a son who was 5 years old, she'd probably have had him kidnapped and held as a sex toy while watching her son's tantrum."
5637,<|emo_surprise|> How amazing!!! I'm so glad that they are able to come and help!
5638,<|emo_surprise|> Oh good lord.
5639,<|emo_surprise|> Really I've wondered that too!
5640,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, you've probably seen this many times. How many students do you have at your school?"
5641,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling a little overwhelmed by the amount of work that actually takes place on my projects
5642,<|emo_surprise|> It was like a game show!
5643,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME]... I almost forgot about these...
5644,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] that's terrible
5645,<|emo_surprise|> i feel curious what makes someone write so poetry so beautiful and so touching
5646,"<|emo_surprise|> I never saw a cop walk over to him and help, and that man is possibly one of the scariest people I've ever seen."
5647,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I had no idea about [NAME] having a daughter, what a surprise! "
5648,<|emo_surprise|> I'm actually kinda wondering what that‚Äôs all about. I‚Äôve always been a huge fan of [NAME] but I‚Äôm just surprised they used her name.
5649,<|emo_surprise|> Who said I hated him? He was never a very good defender
5651,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my god
5652,<|emo_surprise|> Well if the police can't make him answer the door then what the hell is he doing in a school in the UK?
5653,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh god, [NAME]! Yes!"
5654,<|emo_surprise|> It's not that bad. Just keep posting videos of her getting frisky.
5655,"<|emo_surprise|> And I thought they were all ""douchebag"" because they all seem to hate the russia stuff. That's just wrong."
5656,<|emo_surprise|> He was just talking about the fact it‚Äôs almost like they‚Äôre trying to get you to play favorites. Lol
5657,<|emo_surprise|> What a weird person [NAME] is
5658,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I wasnt expecting that.
5659,<|emo_surprise|> i began feeling myself getting very confused
5660,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs... really unexpected actually.
5661,<|emo_surprise|> I'm shocked that he thinks he can outrun a 4K race.
5663,<|emo_surprise|> Omg i‚Äôm crying rn
5664,<|emo_surprise|> oh my gooooooooood
5665,<|emo_surprise|> Whoa I didn't know they are down on their food but whoa
5666,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. Thanks for the correction. I am very sorry for this, it is extremely unwelcome. I really hope you enjoy reading!"
5667,<|emo_surprise|> I've been told that's not true but I've never seen it anywhere else. I was quite surprised when they changed it to 2x. Even then
5669,<|emo_surprise|> You win the Internet today.
5670,<|emo_surprise|> i feel weird and uncomfortable and i don t know how i expect to spend the next week
5671,<|emo_surprise|> i see this now i feel weird
5672,<|emo_surprise|> >[NAME] That one-liners are actually pretty funny and not cringe-worthy at all.
5673,<|emo_surprise|> I've always wondered what that is in terms of autism.
5674,"<|emo_surprise|> I think these people might actually be onto something. I mean look at these people, they're so calm and collected together."
5676,<|emo_surprise|> Well at least he has a buddy group of 5. That's all I need.
5677,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôd do that if I was an elected official. I‚Äôd vote for him over [NAME]...
5678,<|emo_surprise|> I never even knew they made them for kids. All I know is they are expensive.
5679,<|emo_surprise|> >The thing that caught my attention was his obsession with a.12 cal. Why even shoot handguns?
5680,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling very helpless and isolated
5681,"<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôd probably go with the 3rd choice of ""got shot in the head"". Just get him to go to the hospital."
5682,<|emo_surprise|> Well this is frustrating. I always thought they're so cute together!
5684,<|emo_surprise|> i feel shocked and slightly overwhelmed and i find there s a reason for the latter
5685,<|emo_surprise|> Oh no! SomeONE is getting molested!
5687,<|emo_surprise|> OMG!diddly wiggle room???
5688,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôd be happy to find a week minimum to get a job at Netflix.
5689,<|emo_surprise|> i really cannot believe that someone can feel this way towards christians
5690,<|emo_surprise|> Wow you are strong did yall just become Theontians?
5691,<|emo_surprise|> That is an adventure!
5692,<|emo_surprise|> I was just at the game! I've never been so happy to be a fan for so long
5693,<|emo_surprise|> oh my gosh i saw the cutest thing you've ever seen
5694,<|emo_surprise|> Oh you lovely people :?)
5695,<|emo_surprise|> oh [NAME] that's horrible
5696,<|emo_surprise|> oh I didn't realize it was that common
5697,<|emo_surprise|> i feel quite amazed
5698,<|emo_surprise|> This is the most recently leaked gameplay video fromDishonored. I‚Äôd go so far as to call this review Fake News!
5699,<|emo_surprise|> Wow!!! I love this.
5700,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling weird with no sleep
5701,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] I love this wow
5702,<|emo_surprise|> Hahah okay then.
5704,<|emo_surprise|> That's an adventure.
5705,"<|emo_surprise|> She lost her legs below the knee, what a freak >:("
5706,<|emo_surprise|> Haha. I was wondering what that was.
5707,"<|emo_surprise|> My wife and I enjoyed the first part of Dragonheart, but once we started playing we dropped it. "
5708,<|emo_surprise|> I cannot believe he called his mom to say his dad is sick.
5709,<|emo_surprise|> Oh boy
5710,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised he didn't say, 'Oh yeah? Well, I heard about that last week,' "
5711,<|emo_surprise|> How dare you question my love
5712,<|emo_surprise|> i feel overwhelmed amp so overwhelmed that i just need to breath
5714,<|emo_surprise|> I am so surprised [NAME] let her post that.
5715,<|emo_surprise|> She's been catching and killing them for years now!
5716,<|emo_surprise|> The fuck? I remember that we were up by as many as 19 points early in the second half. And [NAME] was 2-11 from the field against SF.
5717,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, it's just passed 2 weeks, what a nightmare. So far, I can't believe I'm here."
5719,"<|emo_surprise|> So [NAME] has a point. People who cannot make rational sense of a lot of the world are somehow ""arguably insane"" in the eyes of many here."
5721,<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is the first I‚Äôve seen of him using ‚Äúshade‚Äù instead of ‚Äúcolour‚Äù
5722,<|emo_surprise|> ohhh
5724,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow the level of preparedness that these nuts have not Mathematically matched, wow the level of prepared"
5725,<|emo_surprise|> Oh man here we go again...
5727,"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME], [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME] are all 6'0"" 200 lb power forwards. We all know I like their game but I don't think it's 3]."
5728,<|emo_surprise|> It really does.. This video is proof that [NAME] is a little bit of a sex god.
5729,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that's a lot of karma"
5730,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow! Didn‚Äôt know they didn‚Äôt have a vanity plate that read ‚ÄúWeed on Your Shoulder, Baby‚Äù"
5731,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you didn't just state your facts. You were more than willing to go out of your way to misrepresent your understanding. You took the high road."
5732,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow thanks, I thought I was alone. My advice was unnecessary as there are more people who know the situation already than anyone who isn't familiar."
5733,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I actually really like those. "
5734,<|emo_surprise|> >You know it's a lie when you can't tell how many calories has been added since they took the picture The_donald said you've only added about 1/100ths of a gram of real fat üòÇ
5735,<|emo_surprise|> i feel shocked surprised and then some

5742,<|emo_surprise|> She didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúoh no‚Äù she said ‚Äúoh no good husband‚Äù and how‚Äôd you know that?
5743,<|emo_surprise|> Omg a drop pass from Cuthbert to [NAME] on the break was the best passing move of the game for me tonight
5744,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is still a bitch..
5745,"<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs not something you heard about her, I took a look and the article was about her husband."
5746,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, he seems aged 30-odd years!!"
5748,<|emo_surprise|> There's no limit when it comes to owning dogs.. We have 6 golden retrievers in our house..
5749,<|emo_surprise|> A shitpost from the uncultured
5750,<|emo_surprise|> Who said [NAME] was only good if he didn't steal? He's great if you don't steal
5751,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is a horrible basketball player but he's also a terrific human being
5752,<|emo_surprise|> Oh there goes much of the economy..
5753,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, sorry, didnt mean to be rude."
5754,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if it happens to the guys I send guys to. I was out of state but I‚Äôd bet most guys would miss it.
5755,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like a weirdo for trusting amp
5756,"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah, a guy who has a gun and a little girl. What a loner."
5758,<|emo_surprise|> What a surprise i never saw coming...so good i almost forgot about it.
5759,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, thanks!"
5760,<|emo_surprise|> How is it a [NAME] thing or a [NAME] thing? The words don't fit and it‚Äôs really hard to be bothered by.
5761,<|emo_surprise|> i find that i can pick and choose what i really need out of the things i bring to my event if i feel more passionate and hungry but still want to feel pretty
5762,<|emo_surprise|> i feel very overwhelmed already
5763,<|emo_surprise|> i wasnt feeling overwhelmed by all the things
5765,<|emo_surprise|> There's always something fishy going on with [NAME].
5766,<|emo_surprise|> omg i got a little bit freaked out that this post was being downvoted at r/tworeddit but then i found the flair
5767,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]? For real? Nah. My heart skips a beat when I think of that.
5768,<|emo_surprise|> Wow i hope she survived
5769,<|emo_surprise|> i didnt say the im not feeling thrilled
5770,<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is a lot more creepy than I thought it would be
5771,"<|emo_surprise|> Happy for him, bad for the system. "
5772,<|emo_surprise|> i can feel his eyes on me and he is sincere while admitting he is afraid
5773,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] was the only one that reacted. I'm shocked and disappointed that the other members didn't react as well.
5774,<|emo_surprise|> i remember feeling shocked and amazed when i saw these
5775,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, it‚Äôs [NAME]! The one who washes dishes!"
5777,<|emo_surprise|> What a gift. Now I'm going to go buy a used car
5778,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised that't a thing has been said about her non-apologies.
5779,<|emo_surprise|> I am really excited for the possibility of becoming a fly on your wall for a romantic interest.
5780,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised [NAME] didn't think of that
5781,<|emo_surprise|> OMG this is so cool!
5782,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised he hasn't already
5783,<|emo_surprise|> Omg yes?!
5784,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] how did I miss that?
5785,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I‚Äôm so sorry you had to go through that."
5786,<|emo_surprise|> The fact that this is written on notebook paper gives me anxiety.
5788,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I didn‚Äôt know that you went by username xxx
5789,<|emo_surprise|> And how dare you question [NAME] being important. and then some üòÖ
5790,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you‚Äôre not special"
5791,<|emo_surprise|> OMG I feel so bad for you
5792,<|emo_surprise|> The double fist bump made me laugh out loud.
5795,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, this is really interesting. Thank you for sharing. üòÇ"
5796,<|emo_surprise|> You know what? I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm not the only one.
5797,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I thought people hated him?
5798,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, y'all are heroes! "
5799,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, 6 downvotes in 3 minutes..."
5800,<|emo_surprise|> Whoa this is cool
5801,<|emo_surprise|> You're right!!! So glad someone was there to point it out
5802,"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, that‚Äôs so true"
5803,<|emo_surprise|> And that hair looked real haggard after he finished.
5804,"<|emo_surprise|> Well, look what time it is. It's Fuck You, It's January!"
5805,<|emo_surprise|> Oh that‚Äôs so nice! You should get this much birthday support yourself.
5806,"<|emo_surprise|> It'll be interesting to see how much of that enthusiasm comes from his fans, since he really doesn't have an actual track record of supporting [NAME]."
5807,<|emo_surprise|> i never thought i would feel so glad when a friend of one of my friends said to me in a loud yet sweet voice that we should buy the other house together
5808,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if that's why it looks h*ckin' smokin' hot.
5809,<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit this sub is losing it
5810,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow she sounds amazing and her family are heroes.
5811,<|emo_surprise|> i still feel amazed at the amount of people who come to watch and listen at a show
5812,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you are some lucky guy."
5813,<|emo_surprise|> oh my
5814,<|emo_surprise|> This is awesome!! I think I've never seen so many people mention [NAME] at the same time.
5815,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I think I'm in love
5816,<|emo_surprise|> i didnt really know how to make anything and i was feeling pretty overwhelmed
5817,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME], you really lost me there."
5818,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh no, it‚Äôs the inside joke"
5819,<|emo_surprise|> Wow the comments are coming in fast
5820,<|emo_surprise|> Wow it's only 2am already
5822,<|emo_surprise|> i didnt really feel very surprised when i saw that i was chosen for an oncology fellowship at jim luhn hospital
5823,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my. I had no idea that was even a thing. I'm so glad you brought it up though. Yeah I wonder how often that happens.
5824,<|emo_surprise|> Is there a way to get rid of them? My pet hamsters seem to like it.
5825,<|emo_surprise|> That guy just has the weirdest body language I've ever seen
5826,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you just described my life!!"
5827,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh no, I'm getting flashbacks!"
5828,<|emo_surprise|> Ohh this!
5829,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, I can feel my own heart!"
5830,<|emo_surprise|> Oh no it did!
5831,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I‚Äôm surprised you found it.
5832,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, I thought every reply was a spam message because it were so good. "
5833,"<|emo_surprise|> Happy cake day, just in case"
5834,<|emo_surprise|> Wow those stats are kinda scary.
5835,<|emo_surprise|> i feel quite shocked that i just read about these things
5836,<|emo_surprise|> i was feeling pretty pleased with myself and the only thing that could make up for it
5837,<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs a wonder [NAME] has not yet been called up for a game.
5838,<|emo_surprise|> What?! I never even knew they had an office there!
5839,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm sure there are plenty of us [NAME] in chat right now, it's just not on here :("
5840,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, I‚Äôm so sorry! I hope you‚Äôre doing very well!"
5841,<|emo_surprise|> You're crazy
5842,"<|emo_surprise|> Damn I‚Äôd say it was a 1 win race, almost definitely not in that area."
5843,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that's great! I'm glad you had such a positive experience on the sub, and I wish you could do that some day! Oh, and your parents? "
5844,"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, I love six pack o' beer"
5845,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised more people didn‚Äôt catch that!
5846,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling quite surprised at how little i think im being punished
5847,"<|emo_surprise|> > Oh [NAME], here is the cringe"
5848,<|emo_surprise|> i feel so overwhelmed i am already thinking about going out
5849,"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]? I‚Äôm surprised he isn‚Äôt a yet, even as a rookie. "
5850,<|emo_surprise|> That looks amazing btw. I have one too and it‚Äôs not the same. I‚Äôd literally cry if it weren‚Äôt for the beautiful snowflake logo
5851,<|emo_surprise|> oh my [NAME] is he in league of legends?
5852,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I feel like I'm watching a scene in a movie with no plot"
5853,<|emo_surprise|> Wow didn't realize they had switched to a 3D Printer. I've yet to put anything together but this looks great.
5855,<|emo_surprise|> Wow so much younger but he seems mature
5856,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, so you are really that into [RELIGION] lol"
5857,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is getting 3 stars because I actually read the article. I honestly have no idea what I'm talking about.
5858,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, your sister is in abusive relationship. "
5859,<|emo_surprise|> i had been feeling surprised at how he didnt want me to be a part of the new group
5860,"<|emo_surprise|> My name is [NAME]. You killed my father, prepare to die."
5862,"<|emo_surprise|> That's actually good, if you're into /r/45secondreplays."
5863,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. My heart skips a beat when I hear of people being charged in connection to an event that was unconnected to any of them personally.
5864,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is killing it these days.... I loved him as [NAME] but he's killing it compared to [NAME]
5865,<|emo_surprise|> No wonder people are calling the cops.
5866,<|emo_surprise|> Wow what a rude andinaccurate response from yourself
5867,<|emo_surprise|> What a nice surprise. Didn't even know about him.
5868,<|emo_surprise|> im a bit surprised i actually haven t heard of this yet
5869,<|emo_surprise|> This is a good thing. Don't let the bad apples spoil the garden.
5870,<|emo_surprise|> What a lucky lot that he found him
5871,"<|emo_surprise|> No biggie, thanks for the edit. Lol"
5872,<|emo_surprise|> Wow my eyes!
5874,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is a bitch
5875,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I'm so sorry you had to go through that. I hope all is well now."
5877,<|emo_surprise|> Wow you‚Äôre a weirdo aren‚Äôt you?
5878,"<|emo_surprise|> Well, that's what I thought too. Thanks for the correction."
5879,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, now I'll know [NAME] didn't lie about 9/11. "
5880,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] I'm so sorry
5881,<|emo_surprise|> Damn no wonder why we don't have an offseason workout program
5882,<|emo_surprise|> Oh he got stabbed in the eye
5883,<|emo_surprise|> And not once in that story were there any women!
5884,<|emo_surprise|> i feel amazed and shocked at the amount of support that i have in this country
5885,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder why they're so angry?
5886,"<|emo_surprise|> Lmao, okay sorry"
5887,"<|emo_surprise|> I think about people commenting on this and saying ""oh well this is why they didn't get a girl who also has a lot of pretty hair"" and I almost do. It is weird."
5890,<|emo_surprise|> You are actually right!!! My kids are really getting the impression that I'm a mean person.
5891,<|emo_surprise|> No joke. This thread is culture shock rn
5892,<|emo_surprise|> The real bad way is to have a roommate. Stay with your parents until you have a roommate.
5893,<|emo_surprise|> Oh geez I thought you were talking about season 4?
5894,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you guys are scary"
5895,<|emo_surprise|> Omg heres the smoking hot pic
5896,<|emo_surprise|> That sounds a little paranoid
5897,<|emo_surprise|> oh my gosh another year
5898,<|emo_surprise|> Really? Thanks for sharing the video. I really enjoyed it.
5899,<|emo_surprise|> I never thought I'd find a comrade here.
5901,"<|emo_surprise|> What a strange thing to say, honestly"
5902,"<|emo_surprise|> I can easily relate to this, having done similar stuff at friend's homes and college. So, yeah. This story is heartbreaking "
5904,"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]? Yeah, he‚Äôs funny as hell, but his body type is weird as hell... "
5905,<|emo_surprise|> I am so amazed I clicked this link
5906,<|emo_surprise|> oh my ffs
5908,<|emo_surprise|> I didn‚Äôt know I‚Äôd see this mention
5909,<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit that was fucking bad...
5910,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I didn't know they would be this good"
5911,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, how does it ""wind up"" you?"
5913,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I only had about 6 hours playing that game...
5914,<|emo_surprise|> Who knew [NAME] had such short memory
5915,<|emo_surprise|> Lmao what a joke
5916,<|emo_surprise|> im not feeling overwhelmed nor overwhelmed by my job
5917,"<|emo_surprise|> A surprise from here, what a strange post. Good to know it was a isolated incident as opposed to what was otherwise a norm"
5918,"<|emo_surprise|> Ohh, the poor man"
5919,<|emo_surprise|> I thought he had an explainer video for that? Geez his voice!
5920,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. He wasn‚Äôt lying. I‚Äôm surprised the judge didn‚Äôt think longer.
5921,"<|emo_surprise|> I didn't even notice until you posted this, and I still can't believe how good of a shot [NAME] is from behind"
5922,<|emo_surprise|> The ‚Äúsad] ‚Äúbut it‚Äôd‚Äù made my skin crawl‚Äù haha. üòÇ
5923,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how the fuck out of this...
5924,<|emo_surprise|> I find it very strange that you have almost no social skills. Are you on drugs or something?
5925,<|emo_surprise|> The face on her shirt... I mean... WHAT???
5926,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what it's like to be this stupid
5927,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, ‚Äúthe real reason behind my skin looks like this‚Äù"
5928,<|emo_surprise|> That's amazing!
5929,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]? Why has he gone 6-11?? That was an awesome loss.
5930,<|emo_surprise|> This is the most benevolent thing I've seen on reddit this week. Thank you so much.
5931,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling overwhelmed and a bit overwhelmed
5932,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, it'salaquaria!!"
5933,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I didn't realize [NAME] had a son.
5935,<|emo_surprise|> I thought about doing it but I feel like I'd be too obnoxious in front of her and nobody would be able to relate
5937,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] that was horrible. into a blanket.
5940,<|emo_surprise|> Oh. Wait. I thought there was nothing wrong with the clip then.
5941,<|emo_surprise|> i feel that i have been quite successful in keeping my wife open to a wide range of experience in the home
5942,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh no, [NAME]!"
5946,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] can‚Äôt believe [NAME] defeated him and lost the belt
5947,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, what a surprise i never saw coming"
5948,<|emo_surprise|> i feel this strange sense of wonder
5949,<|emo_surprise|> Weird. Maybe I'm being paranoid.
5950,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, yes. I can only imagine. I'm not exactly sure how the story came about but I did enjoy it at the time. "
5951,<|emo_surprise|> Damn I‚Äôd be amazed if that was the case
5952,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I think I‚Äôve shaken hands with the sun this entire week.
5953,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] just don't care about our emotions
5956,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how that works... I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen similar deals before.
5958,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised they haven't done it yet tbh :D
5959,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, the irony."
5960,<|emo_surprise|> She's a terrible host.
5961,<|emo_surprise|> Why have I missed all these great threads already?!?!??
5963,<|emo_surprise|> > [NAME] what a horrible choice. You have no idea what you're talking about
5964,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] I missed it
5965,"<|emo_surprise|> Omg, they are actually living together?? Is this from ‚ÄúBeing Human‚Äù? I love [NAME] :)"
5966,"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah, it is weird to talk about dead people, even stranger to have two DMs about it. "
5968,"<|emo_surprise|> Ah, that's why I've chosen my words with so much care. [NAME] is a monster "
5969,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling overwhelmed so i hope you have everything you need with you when you go
5970,<|emo_surprise|> Oh no! Don‚Äôt touch that!
5971,<|emo_surprise|> It's so weird how popular Nandos is in Britain.
5972,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. I don t know much about politics, but I think this is a good one..."
5973,<|emo_surprise|> Omg my brain hurts... you are so right
5975,<|emo_surprise|> She must have a very interesting life
5976,<|emo_surprise|> Wow you‚Äôre so supportive! ‚ù§Ô∏è
5977,<|emo_surprise|> Omg that's the best. This kid truly has no idea what he's talking about
5978,<|emo_surprise|> *ouch* what a shame that online sellers are getting into the equation
5980,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling really curious about all these things but im terrified i wont know anything until my parents have been able to contact a lawyer
5981,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME], no wonder the military is losing an arms race for them."
5982,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] no!
5983,<|emo_surprise|> i cant help but feel so overwhelmed
5984,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you have a lot to learn about life."
5985,<|emo_surprise|> i was about to say something like i m just wondering what it was about but im feeling shocked
5986,<|emo_surprise|> Oooooh wow I didn't realize there were already plans for them!
5987,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you‚Äôre a realist? You‚Äôre probably right."
5988,<|emo_surprise|> i feel excited about my new job as a mom in a big family
5990,<|emo_surprise|> Lol I‚Äôm surprised they found enough Adderall to get that high.
5992,"<|emo_surprise|> And then they took it away and started talking about credit limits and interest rate deregulation, which they couldn't fund since they already have a huge debt load because of their massive credit default swaps. That's gonna be a testical fireworks show "
5993,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, what a recover. This is what the recovering addict should be thankful for."
5994,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, I didn‚Äôt even know there was a word for this! ü§¶ "
5995,<|emo_surprise|> I never knew such a thing existed.
5996,<|emo_surprise|> omg i got you bro
5997,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME], oh no Oh no no no no"
5998,<|emo_surprise|> Why? I‚Äôd give anything to watch [NAME] playing [NAME]
5999,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you‚Äôre a real crier."
6000,<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs a wonder you‚Äôre still single
6001,<|emo_surprise|> And the good news is that since it was born in 2019 she is expected to pass away before reaching middle age
6002,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is one of my best friends... I hate those players
6003,"<|emo_surprise|> They're all so smug, they all love Google+ too."
6004,"<|emo_surprise|> I always wondered which one of them wrote the lyrics ""[NAME] no one loves me"""
6005,"<|emo_surprise|> And when I say I‚Äôm shocked, he doesn‚Äôt react"
6006,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. Can it be that simple?
6007,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs a great picture!
6008,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling so overwhelmed im giving up
6009,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is a great writer but sometimes he just seems inconsistent.
6011,<|emo_surprise|> Yeah and the irony is that some might even find it offensive and should be embarrassed by it
6013,<|emo_surprise|> I can't remember a time in my adult life when I wasn't inspired by a woman. That's what my life is all about.
6014,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG! An all-star?! Yikes, we need [NAME] "
6015,<|emo_surprise|> OMG where did all these come from? I can't believe I went into this expecting something like this.
6016,<|emo_surprise|> Ah man I remember seeing this video 3 years ago and loving it as a kid!
6017,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is a freak.
6018,<|emo_surprise|> i start to feel impressed with her
6019,"<|emo_surprise|> I wasn't expecting [NAME] to get a yell out there, though."
6021,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling curious about the whole tree like tree and also its color
6023,<|emo_surprise|> And I wonder why none of you have joined in.
6024,<|emo_surprise|> I'm just thrilled I'm not living in Syria
6025,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is a fucking monster.....
6026,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a bit surprised that i still use an Apple Mac
6028,<|emo_surprise|> oh it‚Äôs [NAME]
6029,<|emo_surprise|> He looked absolutely devastated.
6030,<|emo_surprise|> So many lies.
6031,<|emo_surprise|> Lmao why not?
6032,<|emo_surprise|> If it's true he's become a very public figure and it's a negative for his image.
6035,<|emo_surprise|> Omg its russ!!!
6036,"<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised they didn‚Äôt have the ""you can get in!"" button"
6037,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. My eyes.
6038,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow dad, you‚Äôre strong did you report him? He didn‚Äôt report you?"
6039,<|emo_surprise|> Omg. The face
6041,<|emo_surprise|> i feel shocked and shocked again
6042,<|emo_surprise|> Oh gosh it looks like I got a virus from just looking at this!!!
6043,<|emo_surprise|> The most ridiculous thing I've seen so far on this thread....
6044,<|emo_surprise|> ohhhh my gosh
6045,<|emo_surprise|> Wow it actually did it now. Now I'm wondering how much longer till we get all the memes
6047,"<|emo_surprise|> Hey at least you won't be living in the ""irony"" Zone...at least until 2020"
6048,<|emo_surprise|> Ah yes and here I was wondering if it was a problem. You gave me a lot of information :)
6050,<|emo_surprise|> im excited as hell for this question
6051,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling a bit more amazed that i had the fortnite one
6052,"<|emo_surprise|> This is super weird, I'm both a [NAME], and [NAME] fan, but wow "
6053,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh man, I didn't even check the sub. What a surprise i decided to check it out."
6054,<|emo_surprise|> i have said many times that people wouldnt look at me with a blank stare at the question that i feel is most important
6055,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a strange connection to my mother
6056,<|emo_surprise|> Really surprised he didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúwhere did I put my shoes?‚Äù
6057,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling a little overwhelmed in school and my mom tells me she wishes i d show up more often
6058,<|emo_surprise|> Lol I‚Äôm so surprised this hasn‚Äôt turned into yet another Reddit thread about [NAME] getting arrested
6059,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Didn‚Äôt expect that. Good for you!!
6060,<|emo_surprise|> I'm amazed all those posts haven't been pulled.
6061,<|emo_surprise|> This was my favorite game of all time on this sub
6064,<|emo_surprise|> The fact that our defense is just SHIT compared to his is ridiculous...
6065,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you are quite shocked they wouldn't just go with [NAME]"
6066,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I missed that
6067,<|emo_surprise|> Happy Banniversary!
6068,<|emo_surprise|> That looks like a good tip. I've seen it happen a lot but never actualized it.
6069,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling very overwhelmed
6070,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if you could share with us a little about the inspiration behind your art. What were some of your usual haunts or sights in the area? Did you come across any surprising things?
6072,"<|emo_surprise|> This just oozes passive-agressiveness, and I‚Äôm so surprised I can read this "
6073,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME]... here we go
6075,<|emo_surprise|> They'd be surprised if he didn't have a video of him smoking hot with a nice haird
6076,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, I‚Äôm so glad you did! You‚Äôre a pro, now!"
6077,<|emo_surprise|> Wow if someone wrote what I just wrote my name would be changed.
6078,<|emo_surprise|> Yeah that was my first thought..
6079,"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, that's full on cringe."
6080,<|emo_surprise|> i feel kind of excited
6081,"<|emo_surprise|> You know you mean *almost* the actual article. Oh, wow. "
6082,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised [NAME] didn't name her [NAME]
6083,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I‚Äôm never seen such blatant anti-Semitism. I‚Äôm shocked as well! ü§∑ü§éÔøΩ
6084,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is my SO
6085,<|emo_surprise|> i feel funny and awkward and I just see how much i liked it
6087,<|emo_surprise|> Can't we just forget the fact he slept with 30 women in his 40 years?? Stop it!
6088,<|emo_surprise|> > It's a pretty damn good thing your friends are living with you. You *could* have said that
6089,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I didn't know they're that good with cheese.
6090,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] I saw a fan meme of this character. I thought this guy was new to ffa but I never saw these before. 
6091,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I was really hoping for a story of this scale.
6092,<|emo_surprise|> wow i want more of these so bad
6094,"<|emo_surprise|> My god, what? [NAME]"
6095,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised it took Reddit so long to decides to get all defensive.
6096,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! You're lucky to have survived!
6097,<|emo_surprise|> Omg yeah
6098,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] let me add to that today. He actually looks quite young
6099,"<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if the guy watching will get pissed and try to take his shirt off, seriously."
6100,"<|emo_surprise|> The surprise didn't surprise me, it shocked me. "
6101,<|emo_surprise|> This is very cute.
6102,<|emo_surprise|> Wow you took it under control
6103,<|emo_surprise|> i feel overwhelmed and i dont feel like being intelligent
6104,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, who is [NAME]?!"
6105,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! Thanks for sharing that
6106,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow what an interesting thread you've written. Enjoy an upvote, you've done an interesting thing."
6107,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised [NAME] let her post that, despite the threats of physical violence"
6108,<|emo_surprise|> i can only begin to imagine is the feeling of being helpless and useless
6110,<|emo_surprise|> i began to feel very overwhelmed with the tasks i had to do
6111,<|emo_surprise|> I mean I'd love to be able to do that but...yikes
6112,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you must've never been on /pol/ or something."
6113,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised how big that is.
6114,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, [NAME] is truly turning into that classic [NAME]! "
6115,<|emo_surprise|> i think this is a really great idea
6116,<|emo_surprise|> Omg. I have the same exact issue!! It makes me feel totally differently hahahahaha
6117,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I wonder how [NAME] is.
6118,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs an interesting post. I‚Äôm afraid we‚Äôre gonna have to assume he‚Äôs a vegans and ignore it üò¢.
6119,<|emo_surprise|> My surprise is not in the title.
6120,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh damn, she changed her mind"
6121,<|emo_surprise|> Oh y‚Äôall i read it in the paper at work üëÄü§äü§ä
6122,<|emo_surprise|> Isnt that what the term means?
6123,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I didn't know [NAME] was in a rock band!
6124,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. I just saw that. I remember thinking ‚Äúoh my God...‚Äù
6125,<|emo_surprise|> im starting to wonder if im not alone if im not normalising the experience by getting married just because im so horny and all
6127,<|emo_surprise|> Whoa!!
6128,<|emo_surprise|> Wtf? Really?
6129,"<|emo_surprise|> Yikes. That makes sense, he's just afraid someone will think the same. :("
6130,<|emo_surprise|> Oh there goes gravity
6131,<|emo_surprise|> Ahhhh good point
6132,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I never knew about this! Thanks for sharing!
6134,<|emo_surprise|> I have seen this before and it still infuriates me.
6135,<|emo_surprise|> Damn. I need a ride to the other end of the raceway..
6136,<|emo_surprise|> i have a feeling the next couple of years will be amazing
6137,<|emo_surprise|> My wife has told me over and over that I should stop caring and stop trying. You are overreacting and ridiculous.
6138,<|emo_surprise|> Really? That's what I was wondering too
6139,<|emo_surprise|> i woke up this morning this morning feeling pretty overwhelmed
6140,<|emo_surprise|> This actually made me chuckle at how stupid [NAME] is being here
6141,<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe this team beat them. They were terrible to play against
6142,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that‚Äôs a fascinating belief
6143,<|emo_surprise|> Holy crap I didn't know about [NAME] until this episode üòÇ
6144,<|emo_surprise|> Oh noooo. Did he drop his phone? Cause I thought he was great at dropping phones.
6145,"<|emo_surprise|> Weird game, just likeworld of adventure wow"
6146,<|emo_surprise|> My god he took it off!
6147,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my god!!!!!!!
6148,<|emo_surprise|> i feel pretty damn amazed that we managed to avoid that
6149,"<|emo_surprise|> > Also, what a weird way to spell [NAME] It's [NAME] :D"
6150,<|emo_surprise|> He's amazing
6151,<|emo_surprise|> The real joke is where he put the mask on the other hand it‚Äôs still eyes shut
6153,<|emo_surprise|> oh my gosh i just watched that
6154,"<|emo_surprise|> Can‚Äôt agree more, their game today was pathetic but i‚Äôm excited to watch tonight"
6155,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh well at least we know [NAME] is not a [NAME] because he showed up for a game, still a shock to be sure, but a welcome one "
6156,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised it's not the top post
6157,<|emo_surprise|> wow thats... extremely interesting the way he conducted himself
6158,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh, that's actually pretty interesting. I also see an article saying he has 4 children with 3 different women and yet his net worth is -$30,000,000. ü§¢ I hear you cry. "
6161,<|emo_surprise|> I can never keep a secret!!
6162,<|emo_surprise|> Well i'm just glad you didn't yell at her dude for using his personal space to someone in a different demographic
6163,<|emo_surprise|> This made me soooo funny! Yikes
6164,<|emo_surprise|> i feel amazed to have people who have done what i have
6165,"<|emo_surprise|> wow, you are strong did you report him?"
6166,<|emo_surprise|> Wow..
6168,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm still surprised her Dad didn‚Äôt call the hospital
6169,<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is the kind of thing people from DICE are saying...I was surprised they were so open with such a thing.
6170,"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah she did say, ""I do not like all this"" It was kind of a weird thing to say. I was like wow the girl in red really has no self control lol"
6171,<|emo_surprise|> It really does surprise me that almost everyone on this sub has a cell phone.
6172,<|emo_surprise|> > or they started losing favor quickly There were those unhappy with the new ownership group as well.
6173,<|emo_surprise|> What a cute baby!
6174,"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] never said he wouldn't vote for [NAME]. He said he would, just as he'd support a less expensive solution without changes."
6175,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, never knew about these. What are they called?"
6176,<|emo_surprise|> I was wondering what that was? Not sure.
6177,"<|emo_surprise|> i wonder if everyone would get this if i wrote ""not so hot"""
6178,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, your sister is a weirdo."
6179,<|emo_surprise|> Wow how have I not seen this before...so cringy and funny
6180,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I don‚Äôt know if you got this but I thought the person you said was my ex.
6181,<|emo_surprise|> Wow my [NAME] can eat anything now
6182,"<|emo_surprise|> It is shocking to learn that not all [NAME] are Democrats, though."
6183,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, if you were me I would freak out"
6184,"<|emo_surprise|> Y'know the thing about this? Shitpost about reddit, you wind up on r/shittyposts "
6185,<|emo_surprise|> I'm wondering what's so special about your husband. Is he really that into you? I've never met anyone who is into you this way.
6186,<|emo_surprise|> i can feel the excitement and excitement on my own brain
6187,<|emo_surprise|> The only thing worse than this guy is a U.S. court accepting his evidence without subpoenaing him.
6188,<|emo_surprise|> How?!?!?! I don't get it!!!
6190,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I didn't know that change had been made Oh good
6191,<|emo_surprise|> Can't believe I'm saying this! The amount that you're saying is astounding.
6192,<|emo_surprise|> The only ones going to be happy to see her are her parents!
6193,"<|emo_surprise|> I don't know a thing about Scottish football, but I'm surprised this isn't more media coverage."
6195,<|emo_surprise|> i feel overwhelmed and overwhelmed i am amazed that i could call all of those hours of work a day over
6196,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I know it. I just realized I had it wrong after it made sense to me.
6197,<|emo_surprise|> Wow your sister has a surprising amount of Twitter followings
6198,<|emo_surprise|> Lol okay cool
6199,<|emo_surprise|> OMG it just shot upvotes!!
6200,<|emo_surprise|> Wow - a little girl wrote a book. Wow - a lot of things in my world are changing for the better!
6201,<|emo_surprise|> Oh man there's a karma thread for this too!
6202,<|emo_surprise|> I have this issue!
6203,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder where all the shit is
6204,<|emo_surprise|> Wow so much younger but still sounds mature
6205,<|emo_surprise|> i cant believe i read this and find myself feeling slightly surprised
6207,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that‚Äôs just... Wow."
6208,"<|emo_surprise|> It was a bit weird to point things out before people, since they're usually pretty obvious. But there's a good reason too"
6209,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, [NAME] I've been looking forward to this game for a long time and have had some major disappointments :D"
6211,"<|emo_surprise|> Thanks for the reply, I also don‚Äôt know the full details of [NAME] case but I agree with you. The unfortunate thing for all concerned is that his acquittal is not going to be final"
6212,<|emo_surprise|> I'm shocked that you haven't been to a gun range?
6213,<|emo_surprise|> Wow the poor car...
6214,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Your sister basically said the exact same thing
6215,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, now I understand why you're annoyed so much"
6216,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, your dad is awesome"
6217,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm not saying we should murder 200, go out and make 200."
6218,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that's just incredible"
6219,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, more than 6% of the state's labor force are unrepresented by any political party. That's crazy! "
6220,<|emo_surprise|> i started to feel surprised and helpless and then i understood
6222,<|emo_surprise|> What a nasty goal
6223,<|emo_surprise|> That's just something you're gonna have to do to get laid - I think it's about knowing yourself quite well
6224,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling a little overwhelmed by the whole world now
6225,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised it's been like this for so long
6227,<|emo_surprise|> Damn I wish I was wrong
6228,<|emo_surprise|> The internet never disappoints
6229,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, the comments in this thread are what I expected. One wonders what that was like for you..."
6230,"<|emo_surprise|> If it's about [NAME], he's just terrifying."
6231,<|emo_surprise|> Omg this is so cool! I love it!!
6233,<|emo_surprise|> They‚Äôre so surprised! I‚Äôm so sorry!
6235,<|emo_surprise|> oh i had it on video
6236,<|emo_surprise|> She‚Äôs horrible
6237,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised he didn't say ""house cat"""
6238,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised everyone is talking about this
6239,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow is that true. And honestly, I‚Äôm wondering what would happen if I did the same thing."
6241,"<|emo_surprise|> oh [NAME], oh no"
6242,<|emo_surprise|> It's a funny sign.
6243,<|emo_surprise|> That's the kind of education that would turn him [NAME] into a properly decent human being.
6244,"<|emo_surprise|> I think I love you, [NAME]!"
6245,<|emo_surprise|> i feel very shocked seeing so many people doing something so horrible
6246,<|emo_surprise|> i think the first response i think was maybe reluctant to let me go because i didnt feel quite as comfortable
6247,<|emo_surprise|> *fumbles and coughs in the general direction of a truck* Ugh...
6248,<|emo_surprise|> i could feel it and even when it was really far away from me and didnt hit me my head it still hurt like crazy just that weird feeling
6249,<|emo_surprise|> *hugs me with a big attitude*
6250,"<|emo_surprise|> I know. She‚Äôs my everyday mom. She‚Äôs a horrible, horrible person."
6251,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you guys know a lot about the ins and outs of Reddit lately, haven't you?"
6252,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, y'all are heroes. Nice work!"
6255,<|emo_surprise|> Wow you are brave!!
6256,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh damn, I didn't know these existed. Thanks! Weird. "
6257,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, glad [NAME] didn't throw the book away"
6258,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling a little dazed and stuff lately
6260,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my goodness. This is the worst thing I read this morning.
6261,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is in the NAGR bible and it isn't a good read for anyone.
6263,<|emo_surprise|> Hm... I'm more than a little surprised I clicked this link.
6264,"<|emo_surprise|> A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one. "
6266,<|emo_surprise|> Is scary that I only know a couple of people using it at the moment.
6267,"<|emo_surprise|> This is so cool, I love her username"
6268,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how much of that is him and how much of it is me
6269,<|emo_surprise|> Oh look a player breaking out of a slump and helping his team win. Sounds insane.
6270,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder why they think anyone gives a fuck about their personal space when most of his/her neighbors are fucking gross.
6271,"<|emo_surprise|> And then they complain about it being a factor, which is nonsense."
6272,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I never even knew there were so many here
6273,<|emo_surprise|> *sneakpeak oh my gosh* Ohhhhh my gosh
6274,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] I hate Twitter
6275,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, by the way, I'm now wondering where that ""S"" on his jersey came from."
6276,<|emo_surprise|> I have no idea what you're on about but I like the meat!
6277,"<|emo_surprise|> wow, that game was a eye opener "
6278,<|emo_surprise|> Damn it I forgot that!
6279,<|emo_surprise|> The internet never ceases to surprise
6280,<|emo_surprise|> Oh. That.
6282,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow 8 hours late, still better than expected for a movie that's expected to gross $62 million."
6283,<|emo_surprise|> Wow...ridiculous
6284,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, wow. Sorry if I meant to be rude."
6285,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, never knew there were so many here..."
6286,<|emo_surprise|> This is the dumbest thing I've seen today
6287,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. It's like she just got woken up by a loud bang.
6288,<|emo_surprise|> I'm literally shocked people call this 4KEG
6290,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME], no wonder people are driving mopeds around."
6291,<|emo_surprise|> What a joke...
6292,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that‚Äôs the only gun I have!
6293,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! Who here is againstsame sex marriage?
6294,<|emo_surprise|> HURRY HARD!
6295,<|emo_surprise|> It would look like this when they are eating out at a restaurant.
6296,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, what a wake up call "
6297,"<|emo_surprise|> > a complete ham sandwich Oh my [NAME], don't give me that. "
6299,<|emo_surprise|> i really feel a bit overwhelmed
6300,<|emo_surprise|> What a steal that was. Very Unlucky OP.
6301,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is what Reddit finds funny about this. Reddit, you are truly the shining city on the hill."
6302,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, I'm so sorry about your experience. I hope this situation helps you move on."
6303,<|emo_surprise|> i am getting the feeling im going to be in need of some more of that
6304,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, how can I relate so strongly?"
6305,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gooooooooood
6306,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh, now I've sat through one video presentation on Reddit and one online course, and am still here! ü§§"
6307,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh! Those are some good quarters, I'll need to have some of that for lunch tomorrow"
6308,<|emo_surprise|> The good news is that the judge is still looking at the case.
6309,<|emo_surprise|> I've never heard of this. Who is it?
6310,<|emo_surprise|> I'm not saying people here are horrible. I'm saying that those around him are very awful.
6312,<|emo_surprise|> What a load of old dirty old shite.
6313,<|emo_surprise|> This really happened
6314,<|emo_surprise|> i am not just sitting here now i really am feeling more than a bit overwhelmed
6315,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I know just bantz

6317,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, she's actually lipsynced?! Yes!"
6318,<|emo_surprise|> Oh shit that was deep
6319,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm so surprised we haven‚Äôt talked about it yet tbh
6321,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that is a big 3 pack! I've never seen those, never twice have I found 3 packs so similar"
6322,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised [NAME] let that sit
6323,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised they haven't done it yet tbh because it was actually news to me a few years ago.
6324,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] no.
6325,<|emo_surprise|> Lol I actually love this story
6326,<|emo_surprise|> i feel really glad
6327,<|emo_surprise|> i dont know if that was a good thing or a bad thing but what i feel now after i see those little kids every day of my life i know i have the capacity to change
6328,"<|emo_surprise|> Haha, that's awesome!"
6329,<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit that‚Äôs nothing
6330,<|emo_surprise|> Oh man I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss <3
6331,"<|emo_surprise|> Who the hell thought he was dead, seriously."

6341,"<|emo_surprise|> Ahh yes, those."
6342,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, wow. I‚Äôm never seen this before. Thank you!"
6343,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] how did i get to this scene? Who's the mommy?
6344,"<|emo_surprise|> >it was a huge fucking deal that the government was going to guarantee all the homes, it didn't matter how brown the council members were"
6345,"<|emo_surprise|> omg, she took it a little too literally "
6346,<|emo_surprise|> Wtf did i just read

6348,<|emo_surprise|> i can feel you werent being truthful and i wasnt being rude you re my best friend and youre the person i trust with information and answers and sometimes time
6349,<|emo_surprise|> How can she do that with makeup?
6350,<|emo_surprise|> Yeah and I‚Äôm wondering what it feels like to be so oblivious about it all..
6351,<|emo_surprise|> Weird I don't think we have a twitter account
6352,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I can finally relate to this character now.
6353,<|emo_surprise|> That was so beautiful.
6354,"<|emo_surprise|> Ah, well I am very happy for you that you have overcome all these odds. But if you still want to go..."
6356,<|emo_surprise|> Omg I had a stroke reading these
6357,<|emo_surprise|> My birthday is in November so I got you. üò∫
6358,<|emo_surprise|> I thought you were misquoting the quote? That's the dumbest thing I've seen in a while
6359,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, this is actually pretty hilarious."
6360,<|emo_surprise|> The amount of shit that went into this movie is just... wow.
6361,"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is what he is, an extremely dangerous combo"
6362,<|emo_surprise|> The way he held the mic up in that creepy little face *shuddered*.
6363,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you can do it!"
6365,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! Yes
6366,<|emo_surprise|> Ouch! My heart!
6368,<|emo_surprise|> i feel amazed by this woman
6369,"<|emo_surprise|> Happy to be able to help. Just please don't call us a ringleader, because that would only make us more dangerous."
6370,<|emo_surprise|> This just reminded me how great I've been to her this week!
6371,<|emo_surprise|> The most exciting thing about this all is that he is only 31.
6372,<|emo_surprise|> I did not know that there were any other veganuary blogs besides veganuary. I love this place!
6375,<|emo_surprise|> Wow so many layers...
6376,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôve never heard of this before it‚Äôs absolutely fascinating
6377,<|emo_surprise|> Holy moly!
6379,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh! I didn‚Äôt even realize I had clicked that link
6381,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm 5'11"" and I'm impressed that most people find this photo ""awful"""
6382,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised they live together in the same neighborhood.
6383,<|emo_surprise|> i want to think about other ways that we might not have this but my mind races back and forth to that day
6384,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling overwhelmed i wonder
6385,<|emo_surprise|> Can you relate? I've experienced it a couple times now and am still shaken.
6386,"<|emo_surprise|> What a weird way to start the day - for the person who posts replies only to wish for hugs, it makes no sense! Lmao"
6387,<|emo_surprise|> No wonder he‚Äôs sleeping pills lol
6388,"<|emo_surprise|> wow, your wife is a weirdo."
6390,<|emo_surprise|> im still feeling a little overwhelmed
6391,<|emo_surprise|> i feel kinda weird
6392,<|emo_surprise|> My eyes!!!
6393,<|emo_surprise|> I'm more than pleasantly surprised that the guy is a mod some days*
6395,<|emo_surprise|> That's super normal for him. Probably has something to do with how much he likes working OC.
6396,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, sorry I seemed to have missed that. I thought you said they were both 39?"
6397,<|emo_surprise|> oh okay. did not see it posted
6398,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. So you admit it's your first rodeo. You're quite the romantic...
6399,<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is nothing but hate.
6400,<|emo_surprise|> He‚Äôs got em in spades
6401,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh no, there's a deal that should get the ball rolling!"
6402,<|emo_surprise|> I thought the same
6404,<|emo_surprise|> Oh it's free with prime now lol....
6405,<|emo_surprise|> Ah a little piece of advice. Tell your kids or they might be surprised a little bit more often.
6406,<|emo_surprise|> Damn... where the hell are you going to live now?
6407,<|emo_surprise|> Lol [NAME] it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre the most recent victim. I could‚Äôve cared less.
6408,<|emo_surprise|> i could swear i heard a crack under her neck and heard her heart a few times
6409,"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah, I know how that feels"
6410,<|emo_surprise|> I really don‚Äôt know you and I don‚Äôt wanna meet you. I would really like a beer but if you don‚Äôt want an adventure then I have an offer from someone else
6411,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder why they're being downvoted.votes are pretty average on Reddit right now.
6412,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh look at you, it's *Thomas the nuclear bomb*!"
6413,<|emo_surprise|> Wow so you're saying that ISN'T a hate crime.
6414,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I've been to 14 states in 14 years! Only in December did I finally make it through November.
6415,<|emo_surprise|> i feel strange a few times a week
6416,<|emo_surprise|> Wow she sounds like she has a deep voice
6417,<|emo_surprise|> I'm not surprised [NAME] did that. He was known for that.
6418,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like im in a weird cartoon or maybe even a science fiction book like this where it does make a funny tbh because if a book is like this and you think you know the laws and theory behind it all then you might be right
6419,"<|emo_surprise|> What a nightmare. One parent said it was the ""ideas minefield"""
6421,<|emo_surprise|> i wonder if you have any links to media i might find useful that relate to this story
6422,<|emo_surprise|> Omg lulzy werk omg werk
6423,"<|emo_surprise|> Ahhhh, now I understand a bit about [NAME]"
6424,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I can not believe this. So many questions, but all I got were these vague vague answers."
6425,<|emo_surprise|> Oh boy is that it
6426,<|emo_surprise|> What a day!
6427,<|emo_surprise|> I just know a couple people in my area who have had similar experiences!
6429,<|emo_surprise|> Oh noooo.
6431,"<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôd be shocked if he plays, let alone writes for, any of these publications."
6432,<|emo_surprise|> No wonder it stayed up. People who enjoy this content will also enjoy this one.
6433,<|emo_surprise|> I just get really nervous when I see him on the floor with [NAME] with [NAME]
6434,<|emo_surprise|> What the heck?! Just from looking at that pic it‚Äôs like 10 feet away from me haha
6435,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised they haven't done it yet tbh...
6436,"<|emo_surprise|> Ah wow, you're funny"
6437,<|emo_surprise|> > How dare you assume my mortality What absolute nonsense from someone with a Bachelors degree in Physical Therapy and no experience whatsoever.
6438,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] I forgot about theÔøΩ Shrek Ghrok!
6439,<|emo_surprise|> I have no idea how [NAME] handled that
6440,<|emo_surprise|> That's how it's been for a while now guys
6441,<|emo_surprise|> i still wake up feeling a little freaked out
6442,<|emo_surprise|> This has got to be the single most accurate and upvoted comment I've ever seen on Reddit. I love it.
6443,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]? Is that you?
6444,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm shocked at how big that defeat is.
6445,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised it wasn‚Äôt much longer
6446,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised [NAME] isn‚Äôt saying ‚Äúthug‚Äù
6447,<|emo_surprise|> Omg i‚Äôd rather them win than me
6449,<|emo_surprise|> I watched the news that night and was shocked to find out it was all about him.
6450,<|emo_surprise|> Well you're also an idiot.
6451,"<|emo_surprise|> My wife had diarrhea for like 5 minutes, she said ""ooof"" while still eating"
6452,<|emo_surprise|> It had weird spelling.
6453,<|emo_surprise|> I find it really weird that she looks like [NAME].
6454,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm honestly shocked that he didn't say, ""[NAME] is a hoe."""
6455,"<|emo_surprise|> Omg no way, has he gone 7 seasons? Like everyone in Canada I watched his first 9 seasons. Never a doubt"
6457,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is having a heck of a career
6458,<|emo_surprise|> Well that's disgusting
6459,<|emo_surprise|> Oh and it's free with prime now.
6460,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, I forgot about that! /s (please don't brigading me lol)"
6461,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that is quite the opposite from what you said
6462,<|emo_surprise|> And I thought you were wrong about the model.
6463,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised the tax rate isn't much higher.
6464,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, the irony..."
6465,<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is the first I‚Äôve heard of her aligning with [NAME]
6466,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, and by the way, I didn't think anyone would say it was a ""sweet"" thing to do."
6467,<|emo_surprise|> The irony really is amazing.
6469,<|emo_surprise|> i feel amazed and overwhelmed and that is very terrifying
6470,<|emo_surprise|> i feel funny just reading these words
6471,<|emo_surprise|> It's even scarier that a former model hasn't gotten the boot yet
6473,<|emo_surprise|> The shock of the news definitely came out when she told them her name was [NAME].
6474,<|emo_surprise|> Weird how people look and act the same way to everyone else.
6475,<|emo_surprise|> I was looking for a way to remove my existing tattoo without it taking up valuable space. I was not disappointed
6476,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like i have an odd mixture of knowledge and wonder
6477,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, your sister in law has just changed her name... "
6478,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I‚Äôve never seen so many deleted comments.
6479,"<|emo_surprise|> It's really strange how people actually think it's OK to make racist, nativist comments about other races and try to pretend it's not ok?"
6480,<|emo_surprise|> And it‚Äôs not just me. This has been a wild 5 days lol. I‚Äôve never seen anything like this.
6481,<|emo_surprise|> Omg did I just read those sounds? Oh they were so awesome
6482,<|emo_surprise|> i have wondered if i am feeling too overwhelmed
6483,<|emo_surprise|> i still feel a little overwhelmed
6484,<|emo_surprise|> They are saying that it was a false alarm too..
6485,<|emo_surprise|> i could feel that amazed me about being such a big fan of such an amazing series
6486,<|emo_surprise|> A lot of people get this joke but not me.
6488,<|emo_surprise|> Is that a man saying he loves you for making him angry?
6489,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh look, a player making the team. What a surprise, you know he‚Äôs been in the league for years now"
6490,"<|emo_surprise|> Hey you, it's not only your right but also your duty to protect the public interest"
6492,<|emo_surprise|> This just oozes passive-agressiveness. I love it.
6493,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like im about to have my most amazing secret ever
6494,"<|emo_surprise|> Hoh, actually what I was looking for, you link the wrong subs."
6495,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that's awesome! You and [NAME] are lucky to have each other "
6496,<|emo_surprise|> This was a weird thing to say.
6497,<|emo_surprise|> It can be made with less effort. You'll be amazed at how good it actually is
6498,<|emo_surprise|> Who‚Äôs shocked we just let [NAME] back in
6501,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a little overwhelmed how about you
6502,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, what a gift."
6503,<|emo_surprise|> He gets some attention as well thanks to his twitchy little voice actor.
6504,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I‚Äôm still here.
6505,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm so glad it‚Äôs a woman who is upset over a boyfriend not a man
6506,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I‚Äôm shocked to see that CRing was able to get him signed. Lol
6507,<|emo_surprise|> i had been feeling quite curious for quite some time
6508,"<|emo_surprise|> oh [NAME], what did i do"
6509,<|emo_surprise|> Oh absolutely.
6510,<|emo_surprise|> Wow it's almost like people are ashamed to be British.
6511,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I didn't know there is a name for this.
6512,<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe [NAME] beat [NAME] at least twice. [NAME] is just too damn good.
6513,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I didn't know they allowed crossbows
6514,<|emo_surprise|> i mean it made me feel kinda weird
6515,<|emo_surprise|> Oh shit lol
6516,<|emo_surprise|> i feel overwhelmed by an amazing feeling I dont know what it is
6518,<|emo_surprise|> Omg i feel you
6519,<|emo_surprise|> She looks so real!!!! You wonder what that amazing skin tone is?
6520,<|emo_surprise|> i don t feel too shocked to learn that
6522,<|emo_surprise|> i feel pretty amazing though so i will be able to stay in regular surgery next week
6523,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, I can‚Äôt believe she‚Äôs comparing herself to [NAME]!"
6524,<|emo_surprise|> i feel shocked and surprised
6525,<|emo_surprise|> i could only Imagine how much pain he must have felt as he told her he was going for that baby he was going to be so proud of her after that
6527,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, wow, what is wrong with her?!"
6528,<|emo_surprise|> Oh look...it's on the website now! :D Thanks guys
6529,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! You are quite the romantic...
6531,<|emo_surprise|> Damn yup I have a date with a truck driver
6533,<|emo_surprise|> Aah my heart!
6534,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what a hug would feel like a lot too.
6535,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, ‚Äúwhat a monster‚Äù"
6536,<|emo_surprise|> i just know my girl wants to be with me and im feeling all weird and then this girl and her friend decide to have a threesome
6537,<|emo_surprise|> Omg I knew the source
6538,<|emo_surprise|> Oh god my stomach. IT IS HARD TO NOTOSE AND TOAST IN THE OFFICE. Please do.
6539,<|emo_surprise|> I didn‚Äôt know he was on there...
6540,<|emo_surprise|> Omg I‚Äôd give my phone to my sister for safe keeping if I were you
6541,<|emo_surprise|> What a game. My birthday is January 2nd as well
6542,<|emo_surprise|> i have a feeling he will be surprised to find it hasn t disappointed
6543,<|emo_surprise|> I'm kinda surprised she didn't mention the n-word or call him a satan.
6544,<|emo_surprise|> I've never seen such a weird way to do it. Thanks for sharing.
6545,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder even with all the injuries there how he would have kept pace with [NAME] for so long.
6546,<|emo_surprise|> Weird. Are you a fan of his other videos?
6547,<|emo_surprise|> It was so weird having [NAME] there but I am so happy for him.
6548,"<|emo_surprise|> Really took me by surprised, 0"
6549,<|emo_surprise|> i didnt feel overwhelmed the longer i was there waiting for my turn and being surprised at how much time i had
6551,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow dad, you found it!"
6552,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, call your mom and tell her of this. I never even knew this existed but it's SO helpful."
6553,<|emo_surprise|> Omg that's so cool!
6554,<|emo_surprise|> So very scary. Insane 
6555,<|emo_surprise|> Who would have guessed the hockey god would come down to Lousiville or even just visit the area
6556,<|emo_surprise|> Wow she took it way better than I expected and I‚Äôm so glad she did
6558,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I'm surprised many parents haven't heard about this!
6559,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I never noticed that either before, but [NAME] is a very interesting and interesting man "
6560,<|emo_surprise|> My god! You‚Äôre on fire!
6561,<|emo_surprise|> oh [NAME]!
6562,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. Is that who made that up? I was sure surprised to find that.
6563,<|emo_surprise|> Wow it's not just me who needs an IT support contract üò£
6564,<|emo_surprise|> What were those?
6565,"<|emo_surprise|> If you are to blame for wanting to live a little longer, then life is a little bit easier."
6567,<|emo_surprise|> The fact that you think like this is terrifying.
6568,<|emo_surprise|> That would actually be rather dangerous to my nervous system. Not that I've done it.
6569,<|emo_surprise|> i can think of right now is that she knew i was feeling weirdly fond of her but there was still something a little creepy about it all
6570,<|emo_surprise|> I did that one. Thank you guys for the laughs!
6572,"<|emo_surprise|> They look like adults, but they're just weirdly upside down."
6573,"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah, the guy wasn't drunk, he just needed a hand. Sorry. "
6574,<|emo_surprise|> Isnt that the god awful truth
6575,<|emo_surprise|> I'm shocked he's that high a scorer
6576,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you think he'd do it? I mean, you've said he's not into some of my younger stuff but yikes."
6577,<|emo_surprise|> Omg that‚Äôs my favorite
6578,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] and [NAME] have been getting offmy lawn lately with their unbelievable togetherness
6580,"<|emo_surprise|> So your ""boyfriend"" was actually the inspiration for your entire look?"
6581,<|emo_surprise|> This is the scariest thing I've seen all day.
6582,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I thought this was a tongue in cheek title
6583,<|emo_surprise|> Who are you talking about...
6584,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised they still make them.
6585,<|emo_surprise|> Wow those refs actually fucking changed the game
6586,<|emo_surprise|> OMG she just reminded me to pick up my spork and forks
6587,<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is pretty good. Can't believe [NAME] let himself go like that
6589,<|emo_surprise|> I am a fan of your writing since you started
6590,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a little bit funny about what people are saying this year
6591,"<|emo_surprise|> If this is true, you really have my trust. Go forth and prove yourself to the people you deal with."
6592,<|emo_surprise|> This is my favorite scene in the movie
6593,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, what a thot‚ù£"
6594,<|emo_surprise|> Wow is it 2019 already? I've been keeping track and wondered when it'd happen because I was still happy with the game. :D
6595,<|emo_surprise|> I am literally screaming.
6596,"<|emo_surprise|> Ah that makes perfect sense, thanks for the info. We're going to try that for sure!"
6597,<|emo_surprise|> i didnt realize i was about in the second grade when many of the things i remember seeing on tv from that period still apply
6598,"<|emo_surprise|> >[NAME]! ""We've never had a murder in our house."" ""Wow. You've been a big helpmate"""
6600,<|emo_surprise|> >The fact my wife didn't leave me What a shock I never saw coming
6601,<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is a lot of words
6602,<|emo_surprise|> I'm sorry for your loss - this story is heartwarming.
6603,<|emo_surprise|> i feel strange and strange things
6604,<|emo_surprise|> Wow!
6605,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, my heart!"
6606,<|emo_surprise|> He was a heck of a catch as well!
6608,<|emo_surprise|> Oh man that was awkward
6609,<|emo_surprise|> Well I'm not sure if I'm supposed to laugh at that or cry because I feel so helpless right now.
6612,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, the comments on here are telling."
6613,"<|emo_surprise|> Lol, now I'm wondering when it will get dark there."
6614,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a few days earlier than normal and the biggest thing is he is not able to make his mother happy
6615,<|emo_surprise|> Omg. He actually said that?!
6616,<|emo_surprise|> Wow... Can I get an example of this game?
6617,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow.. you are not from anywhere exactly, are you?"
6618,<|emo_surprise|> What a steal that was...
6619,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you're so right. Thank you for the update."
6620,<|emo_surprise|> Wow... You missed everything
6621,<|emo_surprise|> Ooooh wow what did I just read
6622,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is so creepy both in himself and the writing. The only reason I gave the show 4.5 is because of these two writers.
6623,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I didn't know that, didn't know that you didn't change it.."
6625,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh my god, [NAME] has 30!"
6626,<|emo_surprise|> He looks really shocked
6627,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, talk about standing up for yourself! (as a [NAME] [NAME]), [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME] I am so proud!!!"
6628,<|emo_surprise|> The crazy part is that the game itself is actually great at letting you know where they're most behind.
6629,<|emo_surprise|> >it was done to heighten the drama Oh... sorry.
6630,"<|emo_surprise|> I was expecting an awful lot more from [NAME], but here we go."
6631,"<|emo_surprise|> Just wow, I thought I was the only one! I'm incredibly lucky to have some incredibly awesome people in my life."
6632,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I feel so dumb for not knowing this. Thanks for sharing!!!
6633,<|emo_surprise|> I think that was pretty cool!
6634,<|emo_surprise|> Yeah I don't know why you're wondering the wrong sorts of things.
6635,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, this is awesome! I am very happy for both of you!"
6636,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that‚Äôs a lot of weed
6638,<|emo_surprise|> i got a really strange feeling there
6640,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is so creepy. I'm in shock that he's a Fox News commentator.
6643,<|emo_surprise|> Wow there really is no other way. It really sucks that the best school in the country wouldn't let her live there even if she had a perfectly sorted grade.
6644,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, she's older than me (25) and more experienced than me (27)"
6645,<|emo_surprise|> That's amazing. I feel like I could eat those every single day
6646,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you guys have some young charges coming up"
6647,<|emo_surprise|> Damn I miss wally he was amazing
6649,"<|emo_surprise|> The worst thing is when your 5'8"" [NAME] is talking about you and you're sitting next to him"
6650,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how they got their hands on this cat food
6651,<|emo_surprise|> Who made that up? That definitely sounds a little crazy.
6652,<|emo_surprise|> i feel surprised that people find this funny
6653,<|emo_surprise|> Oh and he's still in love with her.
6654,<|emo_surprise|> Wow there is a fairly large community here
6655,<|emo_surprise|> How the fuck not
6656,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow dad, who would of known about this!"
6657,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, you got me there"
6658,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh no, is that you?"
6660,"<|emo_surprise|> > Also known as: Fuck off, it's less than a month until the general election anyway."
6661,<|emo_surprise|> i feel funny in my underwear haha
6662,<|emo_surprise|> You are beautiful.
6663,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG I‚Äôm dying, what a horrible list "
6664,<|emo_surprise|> Ah the high ground they seek. It seems more like a dream then reality.
6665,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that's more disturbing than the bible verses right there
6667,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh she's turning [NAME] into a meat tenderizer!!
6668,<|emo_surprise|> i always feel surprised about the people who actually visit my website
6669,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised that [NAME] didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúoh yeah‚Äù.
6670,<|emo_surprise|> i just feel really weird now
6671,<|emo_surprise|> Ohh the irony [NAME] never said that
6672,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I can‚Äôt believe that happened
6673,<|emo_surprise|> The irony is you're saying the opposite of everything he said
6674,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is really coming into his own. I‚Äôm very happy for him.
6675,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I know so many people are like this, I just can't imagine being called that"
6676,<|emo_surprise|> The fact that you're not a man is even scarier.
6677,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, this post was incredibly stupid"
6678,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME], I knew this!"
6679,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, that's so odd. I wonder what happened."
6680,<|emo_surprise|> OMG this hit me with de good ol memories
6681,<|emo_surprise|> The only way to find out is to go to a doctor and have him performed a x-ray.
6683,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME]. I thought I knew [NAME].
6684,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow that‚Äôs terrible.. I hope you and her doctor are OK... both of you, at least. Sounds like you and her will get a new doctor and/or an entire new course of treatment. "
6685,<|emo_surprise|> Can't believe he's that old.
6686,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh that‚Äôs exactly what it is! I‚Äôm so honored that my child actually has a sense of humor
6687,<|emo_surprise|> >[NAME] has to play like it's the most recent season with a $100M contract on the line but he doesn't. How strange.
6690,<|emo_surprise|> That's because he doesn't care. He's not going to ask about your health when he doesn't know what's going on.
6692,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling just a little bit more vulnerable
6693,<|emo_surprise|> Omg I had to rewind 3 times to watch this lol
6694,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow so you have a new album out, what a surprise..."
6695,"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, didn't know you could do that."
6696,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. Was not expecting the tacked on ""boyfriend/sister"" part. Also, I don‚Äôt see how that makes any sense."
6697,"<|emo_surprise|> wow, that is some information im sure you had not thought of. Thanks so much for sharing your incredibly amazing story"
6699,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] this is so true. I feel like I saw some distant cousin. I'm so sorry for your loss
6700,<|emo_surprise|> No wonder oil prices are going crazy
6701,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I was going to say that?!
6702,<|emo_surprise|> Oh no the poor man
6703,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what her reaction would be if she knew she helped create this monster.
6704,<|emo_surprise|> This is hilarious. She is one of the few players to actually show us how bad [NAME] is at knowing what the hell they're doing.
6705,<|emo_surprise|> The fact that these people would spend 5 bucks at a gun show just to get a picture with a deer is absolutely fascinating.
6706,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] these Are some bad calls
6709,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh man, you did it"
6710,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh boy, that gets me. What other jobs do non-physicians hold?"
6711,<|emo_surprise|> I thought I was the only one! I really hope to get started next week
6712,<|emo_surprise|> i was starting to feel a little overwhelmed and it gave me a good laugh
6713,<|emo_surprise|> Omg I am so speechless
6714,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I didn‚Äôt think they could be that stupid.
6715,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised they're letting people on the property for birthday parties.
6716,<|emo_surprise|> Thats pretty lewd.
6717,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what people think about losing their job over this.
6718,<|emo_surprise|> The [NAME] is really excited.
6719,"<|emo_surprise|> > or less likely No, more likely he thinks he's better than everyone and not that people actually see it that way"
6720,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, I didn't know that was the law in place in New Jersey."
6721,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I did not know [NAME] is still alive.
6722,<|emo_surprise|> i almost feel jealous of dave
6723,<|emo_surprise|> Wow my friends how much I love this. They do this a lot
6724,<|emo_surprise|> i really can't appreciate the person who wrote this article and i feel a little shamed and wondering what they could be doing at home in our little home town of hollywood
6725,<|emo_surprise|> *finally* got the message
6726,<|emo_surprise|> So much more confident as a result
6727,"<|emo_surprise|> wow, what a steal that pass was"
6728,<|emo_surprise|> I thought I was the only die hard fan of the original GF who played [NAME]. I'm amazed I didn't see more.
6730,"<|emo_surprise|> Omg that is so nice! I‚Äôd never seen that before, am super happy for you and your dog."
6731,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. He really went after [NAME] so hard.
6732,<|emo_surprise|> It's the world's thinnest underwear.
6733,<|emo_surprise|> This is the first time I actually get genuinely inspired to learn a new language at this rate. Thanks for the inspired inspiration.
6735,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] how are they downvoted?
6736,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, and I saw it on Reddit and thought it was funny so I posted it here"
6737,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling a little overwhelmed and a bit gloomy and i havent eaten yet
6738,<|emo_surprise|> Omg [NAME]!
6739,<|emo_surprise|> i do feel surprised i never thought to look for this article before
6740,<|emo_surprise|> A guy with superpowers doesn‚Äôt make me wanna go off to the races üòÇ
6741,"<|emo_surprise|> Damn you, now I can hear that [NAME] are stage diving"
6742,<|emo_surprise|> It's actually amazing because it's true. Some people have a strange way of looking at things
6743,<|emo_surprise|> OMG I thought you said [NAME]
6744,<|emo_surprise|> This is really creepy. I like the look of it.
6746,<|emo_surprise|> Oh no the horror!
6747,<|emo_surprise|> You've got to be a dork to enjoy this video.
6749,<|emo_surprise|> What a valuable relationship.
6750,<|emo_surprise|> i dont know why im feeling so overwhelmed with all that is going on but im excited
6751,<|emo_surprise|> Wooo I‚Äôve been there. The carpool part of the movie sucked for everyone...
6752,<|emo_surprise|> Wow now I have no more reasons to hate my job
6753,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised she didn't say the same thing about the first girl
6754,<|emo_surprise|> That is rather surprising.
6755,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder why they have 6 train cars?
6756,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, what a bodybuilding secrets."
6757,<|emo_surprise|> I can go for broke and get an equivalent to the seats in New York or LA but nothing.
6758,<|emo_surprise|> Oh no it doesnt!
6759,"<|emo_surprise|> Omg, I'm so sorry."
6760,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you guys are having a field day today"
6761,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, what a steal that pass was"
6762,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, no, no no no no"
6763,<|emo_surprise|> He‚Äôs a pro gamer there! I love our scene but god here are some ppl who are assholes
6764,<|emo_surprise|> I wish it had more flair.
6766,<|emo_surprise|> i feel amazed at the amount of energy it takes to run and still be moving
6767,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised he didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúoh we have a better offer for you then‚Äù
6768,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if the little girl on the left noticed the cat's scent and didn‚Äôt make the connection.
6769,<|emo_surprise|> Wow those are some pretty big shoulders to bear...
6770,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I hate her even more now.
6771,<|emo_surprise|> What this?? I love it!!
6773,<|emo_surprise|> ohhhh
6774,<|emo_surprise|> The fuck? I thought people hated OkCupid then
6775,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised we had to live through the last administration.
6776,<|emo_surprise|> Omg I just finished and it RINGS!!!
6777,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if the kid is actually a botanist. I find botanist books weird and boring (I'm an arborist).
6778,<|emo_surprise|> oh god the cringe
6779,<|emo_surprise|> Who is afraid of [NAME]?
6781,<|emo_surprise|> Oh good lord...
6782,<|emo_surprise|> i was going about my life and suddenly these moments come flooding through
6783,<|emo_surprise|> I love my state sometimes
6784,"<|emo_surprise|> The only other comment about this song was a friendly ""do you mind if I post it here?"" and the video link was clicked..."
6785,<|emo_surprise|> You're a weirdo....
6786,<|emo_surprise|> i do believe though is the fans will love her
6787,<|emo_surprise|> Oh good lord did I just hear that
6788,<|emo_surprise|> Omg 15 did you read the story. WHAT? WHAT? THAT WAS THE WORST. TED Talk. WORLD UP.
6789,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you people are really terrible."
6791,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh!!!!!! üòÇ üíîüèª
6792,<|emo_surprise|> Oh no! You got this!
6794,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling a little surprised and a
6795,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh! A hand mixer!
6796,<|emo_surprise|> Can we get [NAME] back? I liked him but he seems inconsistent and teams just never wanted him.
6797,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh my god, I need to watch this. It's definitely worth Watching in progress."
6798,<|emo_surprise|> i feel curious
6799,<|emo_surprise|> It was so damn funny
6800,<|emo_surprise|> Really impressed i haven't read anything about him before.
6802,<|emo_surprise|> No it isn't he just told you how much he loves you!?!?!?!
6803,<|emo_surprise|> i just have the feeling that she s waiting here
6804,"<|emo_surprise|> Lol, never heard of that before. Good for you man. "
6805,<|emo_surprise|> I am surprised the police have not sent her to a mental institution
6806,"<|emo_surprise|> Ah the high life, the sweet life!"
6807,<|emo_surprise|> i feel dazed and have a new respect for the world
6808,"<|emo_surprise|> My parents died, I was like ""what?!"""
6809,"<|emo_surprise|> I never got round to it, sorry. In Germany there was a game about it once."
6810,<|emo_surprise|> omg this is so cool! i have some bucksies already so this will show me if they are worth it though :)
6811,<|emo_surprise|> This is amazing. Imagine if Reddit did that!
6812,"<|emo_surprise|> The most festive thing that can possibly happen to a human body, honestly."
6813,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a little silly and proud of myself
6814,"<|emo_surprise|> Wtf I just read the article and thought oh my, wow"
6815,"<|emo_surprise|> No, I just didn‚Äôt look the part but I feel free to speak if you wish."
6816,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm glad everything came out okay for you, mate. "
6819,<|emo_surprise|> I never heard anything about this (and am probably surprised)
6820,<|emo_surprise|> The music caught me off guard
6821,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how they roll with [NAME] and the rest of that gaggle of n00b buddies
6822,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow. You had me at ""oh yeah, that's good for a laugh"""
6823,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] in college playing sports he gets an injured hand and the fingers are numb.
6824,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I got it.
6825,<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs a great tool! I use it every day!
6826,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] I knew this couldn‚Äôt possibly be real
6827,<|emo_surprise|> Oh that's so nice
6828,<|emo_surprise|> Lol lol
6829,<|emo_surprise|> That's a big meal for 6.
6830,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh. It is you again, on mobile?!"
6831,<|emo_surprise|> I'm a bit surprised that the cops had her taken into custody lol.
6832,<|emo_surprise|> Wow she's just got the uncanny valley of beauty.
6833,<|emo_surprise|> Omg this was the best inspiration i've heard for a short story.
6834,<|emo_surprise|> Hey that's me every damn time
6835,<|emo_surprise|> WTF that‚Äôs awesome.
6836,<|emo_surprise|> Omg this is so awesome!
6837,<|emo_surprise|> Ah she dead
6839,<|emo_surprise|> I can't believe [NAME] defeated Canelo. took that beating like a professional.
6840,"<|emo_surprise|> I have been thinking about it, but am hesitant to talk about it at work because it would be terrible if I was."
6841,<|emo_surprise|> Omg my heart!
6842,<|emo_surprise|> oh damn it
6843,<|emo_surprise|> oh [NAME] what did i do
6844,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I know right!
6845,"<|emo_surprise|> If they are talking about a company they work for, it seems less suspicious than if it was an off-hand remark by someone at a reception"
6846,<|emo_surprise|> They got caught on camera getting heckled and jeered at while en route to jail. This is how free we've become in America.
6848,<|emo_surprise|> Whoops I misread
6849,<|emo_surprise|> i was feeling quite amazed at myself at how little time i had
6850,<|emo_surprise|> The only one that actually cares
6851,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is amazing the kid just does it wow
6852,<|emo_surprise|> Why does everyone always assume I have multiple favorite bands irl
6853,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling a little shaken up a
6855,<|emo_surprise|> Well done. Not to mention I‚Äôm in my early 3 months and I‚Äôm getting 2.5k upvotes a day. Omg.
6856,<|emo_surprise|> Oh this belong here
6857,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, noted."
6858,<|emo_surprise|> Omg I am so glad! üíï
6859,<|emo_surprise|> Wow so you are quite the romantic...
6860,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. I thought he was trolling oops.
6861,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I'm shocked at how many people didn't catch that."
6862,<|emo_surprise|> Omg I cant believe you won!! Congratulations!!
6863,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh no, a video of someone hitting aello and a pizza truck?!"
6864,"<|emo_surprise|> What a weird thing to say. Also: I'm getting a lot of new people in my twitch chat, so that should be good. "
6865,<|emo_surprise|> i feel weird doing this but i really want to
6866,<|emo_surprise|> It was nice knowing you all. Thanks for the memories.
6868,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, the amount of hate that [RELIGION] and its umbrella religion has gotten in the past few years is astounding. "
6870,<|emo_surprise|> How I never felt this sad before I watched this
6871,<|emo_surprise|> i feel that the most amazed of people is me
6872,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, if a tree falls in Croydon then won't get very far, huh?"
6873,<|emo_surprise|> I'm curious if you have tried pasteurization before. How successful was it?
6874,<|emo_surprise|> > It would amount to the most flagrantly illegal act ever committed in world history and would absolutely disgrace the Holy See. No. Yes.
6875,<|emo_surprise|> This is weird. Why do you use a video camera?
6876,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh it's happening again... I don't know why but it's happening more often
6877,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, talk about being [NAME]."
6878,<|emo_surprise|> Oh damn!
6879,<|emo_surprise|> What a steal that song was. Loved that beat
6881,<|emo_surprise|> I was surprised [NAME] didn't say that.
6882,<|emo_surprise|> Oh of course the refs missed a wide open 3rd.
6883,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] it's me again, trying to find ways to kill more/less quickly"
6884,"<|emo_surprise|> > He really doesn't mind giving the old ""I just have a feeling"" excuse."
6885,<|emo_surprise|> i can feel shocked and how this person s opinion isnt right
6886,<|emo_surprise|> OMG OMG!!!
6887,<|emo_surprise|> This is the same man who was recently caught on camera shoplifting an entire case of beer.
6888,<|emo_surprise|> Really? I didn't know that many people know that
6889,<|emo_surprise|> OMG. What?
6890,"<|emo_surprise|> I didn't know he wrote for The Daily Wire, thanks for the lead!"
6891,<|emo_surprise|> i feel really amazed and amazed and more than a bit overwhelmed
6893,<|emo_surprise|> She looks like a Surgeon general
6895,<|emo_surprise|> i just find the weirdos hilarious at work
6896,<|emo_surprise|> I did not know that! Congrats on the change!
6897,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling pretty amazed to think that i actually actually did that
6898,<|emo_surprise|> i feel very surprised that i live in a country with laws criminalizing peaceful assemblies and the establishment of zones where people are expected to be silent
6899,<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is why I‚Äôm here
6902,<|emo_surprise|> It might be a game. We can only dream.
6903,<|emo_surprise|> I have no idea how [NAME] has managed to get himself into where he is now.
6904,<|emo_surprise|> i began to feel overwhelmed by a number of key points
6905,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! You have a lot of experience...
6906,<|emo_surprise|> Ahh I see. Maybe we should find a way to make him jealous.
6907,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I thought the same
6908,<|emo_surprise|> I'm wondering if it's a thing in some places. I'm also from Brazil and having your parents live in another country would be illegal there
6909,<|emo_surprise|> I was wondering what that was!
6910,<|emo_surprise|> Yikes. This kind of freaked me out.
6911,"<|emo_surprise|> I'll admit, I wasn‚Äôt as surprised as some of you were by the offer. "
6912,<|emo_surprise|> Omg there's so many more in there! Thanks for the reference bud!
6913,"<|emo_surprise|> I was wondering why she had never said this. ""You deserve to have your vagina inspected"""
6914,<|emo_surprise|> i feel the weird way in which im supposed to feel but im just a bit surprised i can
6915,"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] the new [NAME]! Oh, my."
6916,"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah that made me soooo uncomfortable, her face just broke my phone. *eyeroll*"
6917,<|emo_surprise|> Yeah I guess so. It's a weird thing to worry about
6919,<|emo_surprise|> Ooooh wow I‚Äôm so dumb
6920,<|emo_surprise|> How the fuck do I say this?
6921,<|emo_surprise|> i will remember the feeling i had for a few days or a month after it was over and can remember the things i said to her out of concern or caring for her that day but when i was back i remember the way i felt i couldn t think i wondered how she could feel the emotions that came with loving an old friend
6922,<|emo_surprise|> They‚Äôre all girls so what?
6924,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is the only woman to win them all
6925,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] how have I not seen this?
6926,<|emo_surprise|> That was a heck of a tip... I bet he pocketed the change lol.
6927,"<|emo_surprise|> No way you're not hearing this, no way I've never seen this before. So good to know!"
6928,<|emo_surprise|> i started feeling this weird sense of control suddenly
6929,"<|emo_surprise|> WOULD YOU rather WE were friends, or enemies?"
6930,<|emo_surprise|> Wow...what a steal that was
6932,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh no, [NAME] is in pain"
6933,"<|emo_surprise|> My god, like that was literally never a consideration. They must really have never thought of that."
6934,<|emo_surprise|> Oh sorry we have a weird amount of free up space
6935,<|emo_surprise|> i didnt feel surprised honestly
6936,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what [NAME] thinks about all this.
6938,<|emo_surprise|> i wonder why i feel more amazed now
6939,<|emo_surprise|> I'm amazed there's someone who loves this so much who actually took the 5 minutes to put together this
6940,"<|emo_surprise|> This is so cool, I almost feel old..."
6941,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is a very interesting character and I would love to read more into her background.
6942,<|emo_surprise|> Thanks this is the first I've seen of this. Was a little worried the same
6943,<|emo_surprise|> i have been feeling this way and not knowing even if you do this is a huge change for me
6944,<|emo_surprise|> Wow we finally got [NAME]. Hope he starts to run like [NAME]
6945,<|emo_surprise|> The guy I had been looking for didn‚Äôt show up but I went to the game anyway. I would‚Äôve gladly paid double that for seats.
6947,<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is a great story! Thanks for sharing!
6948,<|emo_surprise|> I hope so! I actually really like the new fatalities so I hope that this bug fix is a huge help to you guys!
6950,<|emo_surprise|> i feel suddenly overwhelmed and confused
6951,<|emo_surprise|> She didn't even respond to my texts asking if I was okay.
6952,<|emo_surprise|> Happy Cake day!!!
6953,<|emo_surprise|> Lol! I didn't realize that was a thing until I did this
6954,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME]
6956,<|emo_surprise|> oh [NAME] that was a rude tip
6957,<|emo_surprise|> Damn we did that
6958,<|emo_surprise|> Oh look a player breaking out of a slump and being quality over the last month or so. Not surprising at this point.
6959,<|emo_surprise|> Omg no way he‚Äôs still alive!???
6961,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised [NAME] hasn't already covered this but it would be a welcome change from last year when [NAME] made some weird comments about it being the equivalent to an interview (i.e. asking some questions).
6963,<|emo_surprise|> Really wow. You took a baptismal for me!
6964,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, there go a href http"
6965,"<|emo_surprise|> So, what we have here is a weird combination of long winded advice from some people that end up looking really dumb."
6967,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, I didn‚Äòt know [NAME] was on there."
6969,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I didn‚Äôt realize we beat the Hawks handily this year. ü§£
6970,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! Didn't know I could find that! Thanks for sharing!
6971,<|emo_surprise|> You're creepy
6972,<|emo_surprise|> What?! I thought you were telling the truth!? Now I'm wondering what I'll do with my free time now
6973,<|emo_surprise|> What a turn of events! Thanks for sharing this so nicely
6974,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a tingle up my neck and suddenly im awake
6976,<|emo_surprise|> Is this a real thing? Because i've always been horny when I see this... wow
6979,<|emo_surprise|> Wow you look amazing
6980,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like the way ive been telling him about things is a little surprised
6981,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm expecting a horrifying amount of sexual favours.
6982,<|emo_surprise|> How dare she?!
6984,<|emo_surprise|> i see you are feeling a little nervous and excited for your new place
6985,"<|emo_surprise|> I've been with this one for years, and it's weird if you just see the signs and don't act on them."
6986,<|emo_surprise|> He did call them assholes! /s
6987,<|emo_surprise|> He is really dumb but he is fun to watch
6989,<|emo_surprise|> So your therapist did?
6990,<|emo_surprise|> I thought I was the only one. I tried looking on these search results but didn't see any.
6991,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] don't tell [NAME]
6993,"<|emo_surprise|> Damn it, they took [NAME] picture"
6996,<|emo_surprise|> i feel more surprised and more amazed than i did yesterday when i saw what i was looking at
6997,<|emo_surprise|> My husband and I watch it almost daily on Netflix. It's amazing.
6998,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you made my day!"
6999,"<|emo_surprise|> They probably don't mind my saying that in a sarcastic tone, but hey, at least they realize I suck at irony."
7000,<|emo_surprise|> i feel kinda funny talking about this
7002,<|emo_surprise|> Damn this looks sick.
7003,<|emo_surprise|> i feel this sudden shift in my heart that hes there with me and hes supporting me
7004,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! Have you ever been to Orlando? It is so nice to have somewhere nice to live
7005,<|emo_surprise|> I do. I like it.
7006,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like a surprised child at every turn
7008,<|emo_surprise|> What a shocker üòé
7010,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, the poor place."
7012,<|emo_surprise|> Damn. I miss [NAME]
7013,<|emo_surprise|> oh god what did i accidentally create
7014,<|emo_surprise|> What a great way to get a young [NAME] to join your stable.
7015,<|emo_surprise|> What a lucky day my birthday was.
7016,<|emo_surprise|> Holy crap that was fucking bad...
7018,"<|emo_surprise|> My god, [NAME]. The worst."
7019,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised they find toothpaste still
7020,"<|emo_surprise|> LMAO! Im so happy for you. Its not everyday that you're able to do that, but damn.."
7021,<|emo_surprise|> i feel funny i feel funny
7022,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]? I thought he was a pretty nice player
7023,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling strange
7024,<|emo_surprise|> Hmmm....
7025,<|emo_surprise|> The music caught us off guard
7026,<|emo_surprise|> A surprise that's sure to delight OnlyGods fans
7027,<|emo_surprise|> What a bizarre situation...
7028,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow... I have no clue what those things are, but I'm glad I'm not the only one who's looked that far"
7030,<|emo_surprise|> It's weird that this is written about me when I'm the one doing the trolling.
7031,"<|emo_surprise|> My favorite so far is ""I don't know."""
7032,<|emo_surprise|> It looks really weird.
7033,<|emo_surprise|> This is amazing! Loved the way he just tossed the guy aside.
7035,<|emo_surprise|> I was just about to comment below but was wondering what you guys all were talking about.
7036,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I really hope the new directions this game direction takes us in future titles like Left4 Dead."
7037,<|emo_surprise|> It's a weird thing to say.
7038,<|emo_surprise|> Soooo did I just receive a PM from a potential friend that she's been chosen for the tri squad?
7039,<|emo_surprise|> i feel amazed by many things around me
7040,"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah, apparently a whole lot of people are weirdly into this shit."
7041,<|emo_surprise|> i have been doing so well over the month that i may not have felt that i should be doing well
7042,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] I HATE those.
7043,<|emo_surprise|> This is just what I told her...I cant stand seeing this! /s
7045,<|emo_surprise|> i was so scared of how i was feeling after that
7046,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I didn't think the owner of the clothing store chain had a son.
7047,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what that feels like...
7048,<|emo_surprise|> i must say i feel quite surprised
7049,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. That's amazing. Thanks for sharing the article.
7050,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I‚Äôm watching and it‚Äôs worse than this post.
7051,<|emo_surprise|> Omg this video made me laugh out loud at some parts
7052,"<|emo_surprise|> My husband gets off at 6:30 each morning, morning prayers with our children and hasn‚Äôt missed a beat, hasn‚Äôt even had a charge since. "
7053,<|emo_surprise|> Omg this is the shitpost of the week
7054,<|emo_surprise|> i feel so lucky that our baby is being so much more aware and aware of our situation
7055,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if the kid who shot [NAME] is still a cop.
7056,<|emo_surprise|> I like how he gets it out so easily tho
7057,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I haven't seen this before, thanks for sharing! "
7058,<|emo_surprise|> Oh the irony
7059,<|emo_surprise|> i feel kind of surprised that he's willing to be so public about it
7061,<|emo_surprise|> i couldnt help but feel like a schoolgirl wondering about how all this had been happening in his little world of ours and im trying to figure out how i could ask him out
7063,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, goodness gracious, how can I be so bad."
7064,"<|emo_surprise|> Omg, I'm tears it in!!"
7065,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what happened to him after that.
7066,<|emo_surprise|> Well done.
7067,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh no, they didn't give the number? That's bad!"
7069,<|emo_surprise|> Well if he really is that awful of a player.....
7071,<|emo_surprise|> They have been doing this for 100 years!
7072,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, you really outdid yourself with this, what a great tip you gave!"
7073,<|emo_surprise|> i feel very overwhelmed and overwhelmed by god s grace
7074,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, you're so generous with others money."
7075,<|emo_surprise|> What a steal that was for theucks
7076,<|emo_surprise|> Yikes. I'm a little surprised it worked.
7077,<|emo_surprise|> Lol no wonder he killed himself. I‚Äôm shocked he didn‚Äôt get jail time.
7078,<|emo_surprise|> I'm wondering what that feels like.
7079,<|emo_surprise|> Is that [NAME]?
7080,<|emo_surprise|> Omg that was an absolutely horrible open shot....
7081,<|emo_surprise|> i feel as surprised as i did i knew it could wait
7082,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling a little overwhelmed right now but thats better
7084,"<|emo_surprise|> *shrug* ""How dare you?"" *back to back* ""How dare you?"" "
7085,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I hope this doesn't mean much, but I‚Äôd like to see some numbers after a year or two."
7086,<|emo_surprise|> Oh stop and smell the coffee...
7087,<|emo_surprise|> Wow he‚Äôs actually a comic Wow
7088,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised it stayed up for that long.
7089,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, didn't know that!"
7090,<|emo_surprise|> i dont know if i feel funny or not because nothing really happened but i dont know why because it s what I thought everyone was saying and why and i am not very happy
7091,"<|emo_surprise|> That was like watching the Super Bowl, except instead of the Patriots the Cowboys and Chargers would be playing for it"
7092,"<|emo_surprise|> >The people you killed were mostly civilians And what about all the innocent civilians? Even with all the gun violence, there's zero evidence of that."
7093,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I think I might have been misinterpreting the title. "
7094,"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with saying x, y or z, but it's just a matter of taste. "
7096,"<|emo_surprise|> I honestly have no idea why they're showering you in public, but hey. "
7097,<|emo_surprise|> Omg I'm so so sorry. That's awful.
7098,<|emo_surprise|> Wow so that‚Äôs how they get away with it.

7102,"<|emo_surprise|> Thanks, I hated it."
7103,<|emo_surprise|> i feel more shocked at the things i read about
7104,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised there didn't seem to be a mass chant of ""kill the satan!"" during the video's cut off."
7105,"<|emo_surprise|> So many great things on the show, but [NAME] is the one that makes me proud"
7106,<|emo_surprise|> I never knew you can do that. It surprised me how much I enjoyed it.
7107,"<|emo_surprise|> Lol wow, thank you soooo much!"
7109,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling pretty amazed that it shows so well
7110,<|emo_surprise|> i feel stunned a href http alexismallory

7114,<|emo_surprise|> That damn wink slayed me!
7115,<|emo_surprise|> Just be safe.
7116,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like the guy who wasnt impressed with myself just because we were not there for a while but why would i say yes because i think its nice
7118,"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah, sorry I suck at irony"
7119,<|emo_surprise|> i feel so overwhelmed and overwhelmed with the challenge as we approach this race
7120,<|emo_surprise|> I was surprised he didn't say this
7121,<|emo_surprise|> This is amazingly uncanny
7122,"<|emo_surprise|> Weird, just went out to grab some ice cream after work and was surprised to find myself at this place."
7123,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised he doesn't say that instead of ""Oh yeah? No problem whatsoever""."
7125,<|emo_surprise|> i feel genuinely overwhelmed with the changes i am experiencing in my body
7126,<|emo_surprise|> i started feeling curious about the whole affair
7127,<|emo_surprise|> i think back to my parents who always thought i was weird i could feel about something for a little bit but i felt amazed amazed the way you can grow up as a child
7128,<|emo_surprise|> I fucking love this game.
7129,"<|emo_surprise|> What time is it? Like, I get agitated by about 7am."
7131,<|emo_surprise|> Well fuck
7132,<|emo_surprise|> I'm shocked that [NAME] hasn't already been told this.
7133,<|emo_surprise|> This is actually amazing. I wonder how she stayed on her feet for that long.
7134,"<|emo_surprise|> It's the most popular comment there. Not surprising, honestly, given the topic. Thanks for your input!! /s"
7135,"<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how that works... either way, he's probably cheating..."
7136,<|emo_surprise|> Wow just wow
7137,<|emo_surprise|> I am about to have a heart attack tonight because I just rewatched this
7138,"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, it's been a while since she posted a picture on instagram. "
7139,"<|emo_surprise|> I actually really liked them, but now they remind me a lot of Half Life 2."
7140,<|emo_surprise|> Damn that is a deep knowledge of the law. What a scary burden that has been put on you.
7141,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wait it‚Äôs the sun
7142,<|emo_surprise|> Who knew we were starting to get a sense of [NAME] as a possible No. 1 pick?
7143,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I‚Äôm glad I live in Cali
7144,<|emo_surprise|> OMG that's so good! What a terrific tip. Thank you. I will definitely use it in the future.
7145,<|emo_surprise|> i feel stunned i want to be dead it happened last week
7146,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, 6 years at 18 wow"
7147,<|emo_surprise|> Is this supposed to be funny? I would die.
7148,<|emo_surprise|> Wow what a weird way to spellstood eugenics. I feel I have to try a new spell
7149,<|emo_surprise|> i didnt feel like he was sincere
7150,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] how you doing bro
7152,<|emo_surprise|> I would be surprised if the judge found her guilty.
7153,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gosh!!!!!! Now all of this stuff is ruined!!!
7154,<|emo_surprise|> I am now fully awake. Now onto the questions.
7155,<|emo_surprise|> What a crazy story. I think [NAME] is actually doing a documentary about it!
7156,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs very nice to know. Best to you friend
7157,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if the car's airbag will work... was it that bad last year?
7158,<|emo_surprise|> i was starting to see the funny side of the relationship but in a weird way i still feel very fond of kassim
7159,<|emo_surprise|> Wow another US college town just got its name
7160,<|emo_surprise|> No joke. Those people are so full of hate and ignorance.
7162,<|emo_surprise|> I never thought I'd see [NAME]. His jump shot is ridiculous.
7163,<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is good dude.
7164,"<|emo_surprise|> Ah, come from nothing, now it's an old story. "
7165,<|emo_surprise|> i was feeling quite amazed at that
7166,<|emo_surprise|> Holy fuck!!
7167,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, how do you explain away [NAME] being asleep for 10 minutes and [NAME] being asleep for 1.5 days."
7168,<|emo_surprise|> i get that youve gotta give up something to survive how hard must be for that to be my first and last time feeling weird as hell
7169,<|emo_surprise|> i honestly cannt believe i have to tell you this but i feel a little more adventurous
7172,<|emo_surprise|> This is a good question lol. The company I worked for didn't have a website :(
7173,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if there's any way to ignore the subreddit. To me it's creepy and weird enough that it surprises me that it's happening.
7175,<|emo_surprise|> Damn... you really just made my day!
7176,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, I changed my mind about the paring down, the peanuts in them are freaking horrible."
7178,<|emo_surprise|> i am having a hard time seeing how i am any different with no clue how i am different
7179,<|emo_surprise|> Wow did i really just read two lines that shocked me?
7181,"<|emo_surprise|> And finally a little message to the guy who sent that nasty note, theyre getting a lot of heat tbh"
7182,<|emo_surprise|> oh ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
7183,"<|emo_surprise|> This is the first I've seen of this. It's a little weird that they're posting these things, I'm sure this is just their normal behavior."
7184,"<|emo_surprise|> Lol I‚Äôd be surprised if he didn‚Äôt know that. The whole ""apparent age"" thing is dumb."
7185,<|emo_surprise|> What‚Äôs weird is saying something is not illegal and taking the law into account.
7186,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, my 2 favorite franchises."
7187,<|emo_surprise|> They could even imagine a world without them now.
7188,<|emo_surprise|> The only sad thing here is people still play our game. Not sure how else to put it
7189,<|emo_surprise|> The third picture is creepy.
7190,<|emo_surprise|> oh u no not funny
7191,<|emo_surprise|> The only cringe is my own
7193,<|emo_surprise|> Can't believe [NAME] got that away from [NAME]
7194,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is here to tell you it's ok. Look it up.
7196,<|emo_surprise|> Oh no now what
7198,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]. I think that one is real and I‚Äôm here to tell you why it feels like a dream.
7199,<|emo_surprise|> That's a cool knife to have around but a ring bearer you might add?
7200,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling amazed
7201,<|emo_surprise|> i almost look funny in these clothes
7202,<|emo_surprise|> Oh man I want to try it!!
7203,"<|emo_surprise|> Weird, I have the same exact gym. I train at the track and it's not weird at all"
7204,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling so impressed by my bach's work
7205,<|emo_surprise|> Lmao no wonder crime is going up if these morons are in charge lol
7206,<|emo_surprise|> This is the one I love.
7207,<|emo_surprise|> I remember playing basketball at home with my sister and her parents and watching all of these overtime overtime games
7208,<|emo_surprise|> I'm shocked this isn't more discussed
7209,"<|emo_surprise|> I didn't know you could do that, though."
7210,<|emo_surprise|> i couldnt help but feel a little stunned and slightly surprised at how fast the car was moving
7211,<|emo_surprise|> The third picture is pretty scary
7213,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder what that feels like?
7214,<|emo_surprise|> It's insane what we do to natural resources.
7215,<|emo_surprise|> Oh there goes much of the country.
7216,"<|emo_surprise|> I did not realize he was 6'4"" to be talking about."
7217,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling pretty overwhelmed at this point
7218,<|emo_surprise|> Well that's news to me.
7220,<|emo_surprise|> Who the hell watched the show this season.
7221,<|emo_surprise|> I feel your pain. The game ended here. :(
7222,<|emo_surprise|> Damn right!
7223,<|emo_surprise|> >[NAME] is a fucking psychopath Oh is that it
7224,<|emo_surprise|> oh.yuck
7225,<|emo_surprise|> I would bet that he doesnt even like the people who vote for him.
7227,<|emo_surprise|> oh [NAME] that's so wonderful
7228,<|emo_surprise|> Well I think I‚Äôve never seen this anywhere else. Wow.
7229,<|emo_surprise|> OMG. I think this is my favorite Gwent game yet
7230,<|emo_surprise|> i did not take on these feelings and am not ashamed if i may say so
7231,<|emo_surprise|> This is awesome
7232,<|emo_surprise|> Omg i am a mother of teen girls and have no idea how her ex managed to convince me to go onive!!
7233,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]... the surprise is why did I not think of it this way...
7234,<|emo_surprise|> Oh. Sorry for that.
7235,<|emo_surprise|> It was actually just [NAME] when [NAME] was going over lines and people were like oh wow
7237,<|emo_surprise|> OMG I thought you were talking about the news? I thought it was cool you said you loved politics.
7238,<|emo_surprise|> I was wondering if that's how we got rid of the bobo wearing [NAME].
7239,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, no"
7240,<|emo_surprise|> A real man had a stroke
7241,<|emo_surprise|> i get excited when i see these beautiful works of art and feel slightly intimidated
7242,<|emo_surprise|> i feel very funny writing an article about this
7243,<|emo_surprise|> I can't even imagine how hard we all had to work to get to where we are today. How much support we all felt from one another.
7244,<|emo_surprise|> I am truly shocked that such awful things do exist.
7245,<|emo_surprise|> I'm just a bit shocked wasn't in there with y'all.
7246,<|emo_surprise|> She didn't even answer when I said I was shocked.
7247,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! What a case in point. The only thing that can rescue you from this is time. It does you a favor.
7248,<|emo_surprise|> Wow you really can‚Äôt relate.
7249,<|emo_surprise|> No. There's a reason he‚Äôs in theNFL. He‚Äôs a legend.
7250,"<|emo_surprise|> wow, no wonder crime is going up if these morons are in charge."
7252,<|emo_surprise|> Happy Birthday [NAME]!
7254,<|emo_surprise|> I can‚Äôt believe [NAME] won lmao...
7255,<|emo_surprise|> i feel weird writing this because im not sure how people will answer but im glad to say there is a great possibility
7256,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs amazing news.
7257,<|emo_surprise|> They‚Äôre looking cool :)
7258,"<|emo_surprise|> How odd that this was picked up by the Smoking Gun. That's usually what they do with these sorts of stories, seems to have gone pretty viral here."
7259,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] was a surprise. I knew it was gonna be good.
7261,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised he didn't get into a scuffle or something
7263,<|emo_surprise|> This will forever be my most hated YouTube moment
7264,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] that's me!
7266,<|emo_surprise|> Just wondering why the fuck these comments haven‚Äôt been made sub-banning
7267,<|emo_surprise|> You do whatever you want. No one will ever correct you.
7268,<|emo_surprise|> Wow more power to you!
7269,<|emo_surprise|> Oh! There goes half my leftovers
7270,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that's...a lot of karma"
7271,<|emo_surprise|> My god [NAME] that was a goal
7272,<|emo_surprise|> She‚Äôs actually a terrific debater too right? Like she‚Äôs so smart but bad at what she‚Äôs saying lol
7273,<|emo_surprise|> What a crazy person he is
7274,"<|emo_surprise|> Weirdly enough, it doesn‚Äôt matter which one of you are a [NAME] idiot lol."
7275,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I did not catch that.
7276,<|emo_surprise|> I think he was just trying to be funny cause he saw the username on there lol. Oh [NAME] there is something I wish I could do.
7277,"<|emo_surprise|> Whoops, misread."
7278,<|emo_surprise|> Omg this literally made me literally sick to my stomach. I could not believe they used him in Maniac Mansion
7279,"<|emo_surprise|> Lmao, thanks for threading that through!"
7281,<|emo_surprise|> Yeah he's horrible but I don't think he's as bad as what the left is saying.
7282,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I thought I was the only one who felt that way! I'm glad my parents saw some common sense.
7283,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, wow, I didn't know she had depression until I watched this."
7284,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh cool, gotcha"
7285,<|emo_surprise|> Can confirm worst case scenario. I have 2 homes and both are over 80% tax write off.
7287,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] whyyyyy did I ever want to date a 35 year old?
7288,<|emo_surprise|> What a crazy day
7289,<|emo_surprise|> What a story. Who written that?
7290,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I know it
7291,"<|emo_surprise|> I was surprised that he was the only one that seemed to think he was getting ""stuck""."
7292,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] I knew it
7293,<|emo_surprise|> What a wonderful experience.
7294,"<|emo_surprise|> The irony of it all, he is also an atheist/agnostics/agnostics."
7295,<|emo_surprise|> That's quite a mouthful actually.
7297,<|emo_surprise|> Oh no now my heart is melted
7298,"<|emo_surprise|> Whoa, thanks for the correction. I've been living with this for about two weeks now. I was wondering what a botox? "
7299,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] in the water looks absolutely ridiculous
7301,<|emo_surprise|> And that wig is awful
7302,<|emo_surprise|> So many confused [NAME] fans out there.
7304,"<|emo_surprise|> Well, that's a story for another day."
7305,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, I felt the same"
7306,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, my gosh! I think it's actually [NAME]. Not [NAME]. I think its [NAME]! I thought you said [NAME] was his sister."
7308,"<|emo_surprise|> It's very interesting that the only ""pro choice"" argument I've encountered calls into question the institution of marriage..."
7309,<|emo_surprise|> And what a surprise i was actually leads by a surprisingly large amount.
7310,<|emo_surprise|> Just got back from a trip to Chicago but had the good sense to take my wife's side... but there are way too many crazy Chicagoans on this sub for me to find a compromise
7311,<|emo_surprise|> Omg no way this is real lol
7312,"<|emo_surprise|> So, I'm in the process of getting a divorce. The irony is I'm also in the midst of learning how to use a divorce."
7313,"<|emo_surprise|> It's an old trick. For as long as I can remember, they've done it."
7314,<|emo_surprise|> oh was that it
7315,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I thought I was going to be wrong
7316,<|emo_surprise|> Really surprised I clicked this link
7318,"<|emo_surprise|> > We could have a full on civil war in North Korea, which I have absolutely no desire for and neither do you."
7319,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, you're creepy"
7320,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling quite curious to hear how it all went
7321,"<|emo_surprise|> wow, that's great to hear, glad it's not just me!!"
7322,<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is getting huge
7324,<|emo_surprise|> Wow your boyfriend/father/sister/co worker is in abusive relationship and this is what you're doing to support her??!!??!!??
7327,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised you haven't.
7328,<|emo_surprise|> Wow you‚Äôre so brave! Lifting & moving is what you‚Äôre lacking lol.
7329,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, [NAME] sure do love his Twitterati."
7330,<|emo_surprise|> Damn I wish! You will enjoy it all!
7332,<|emo_surprise|> I love him!
7333,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh absolutely! We need more women like you, [NAME]!"
7335,<|emo_surprise|> That would explain a lot. I wonder what sort of background you have.
7336,<|emo_surprise|> Hooray for [NAME]!
7337,<|emo_surprise|> Yikes. That sounds terrible. I hope everything is okay with you.
7338,<|emo_surprise|> Ah so interesting! Where can I find more of these?
7340,<|emo_surprise|> I really miss SFist's Apartment Sadness column.
7341,<|emo_surprise|> OMG there are dead people in this drawing too!
7342,<|emo_surprise|> I'd be surprised if she was married at all.
7343,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I didn't know [NAME] could do that
7344,<|emo_surprise|> OMG I can't believe we elected this goon
7346,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] this is so powerful
7347,"<|emo_surprise|> Ahhh, so that's what they know too!"
7348,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I didn't knew you could do that
7349,<|emo_surprise|> Wow these thots are desperate.
7350,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, [NAME] actually has a surprisingly large following on Reddit."
7351,<|emo_surprise|> i love the smell of it oh man i have a strange feeling that may be mine
7353,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, great news bro!"
7354,<|emo_surprise|> Really? I thought you were talking about the video?
7355,<|emo_surprise|> I don't see why we shouldn't be delighted by this development.
7357,<|emo_surprise|> This is the most recently posted live on Reddit thread about this. Wow.
7358,<|emo_surprise|> i feel strange just looking at it
7359,<|emo_surprise|> i don t really feel like its too much of a stretch to say his arc is a prequel to the main plot of dazed lord
7360,<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs really weird how much I love these so many little red things.
7361,<|emo_surprise|> My ears are hurting from this
7362,<|emo_surprise|> i think you feel very shocked and impressed that we could pull it off in this style
7363,<|emo_surprise|> Wow didn't notice the shirt was still on sale.
7364,"<|emo_surprise|> If this is the kind of support I'm looking for, I can't thank you enough *constructive advice encouraged*."
7366,<|emo_surprise|> omg [NAME] and [NAME] from Ghost Adventures are back! adventure!
7368,"<|emo_surprise|> What a story. I mean, I *love* stories of this sort, but this was a *platonic* moment. "
7369,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like im living in a strange time and place
7370,<|emo_surprise|> OMG I can‚Äôt believe this team beat Nashville last week
7371,<|emo_surprise|> Lol wtf
7372,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm not surprised he accepted that. He handled things really well.
7373,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME], you missed the chance..."
7374,<|emo_surprise|> What? What a stupid question... I've always wondered
7375,<|emo_surprise|> Ah yes the one that gave me the fright
7376,<|emo_surprise|> I'm actually surprised they got married...
7378,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that‚Äôs more than I expected. You went off every expectation I had and surprisingly came close
7379,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh! I didn't read it, but I see she's married"
7380,<|emo_surprise|> I thought he just seemed like a cool player
7381,<|emo_surprise|> Omg this is so cool! Wow that‚Äôs just one of his weirdest songs ever lol
7382,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, your sister is a horribleologist!"
7383,<|emo_surprise|> What a weird character to use for something like this.
7384,"<|emo_surprise|> The other week I said I felt for this season so damn badly, I was surprised it came out this far."
7385,<|emo_surprise|> Omg this made me cringe hard
7386,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling a little bit overwhelmed
7387,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! What a surprise. You heard all about it!
7388,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I think I speak for a lot when I say: ""Hey, at least you aren't some idiot who just happens to be attractive."""
7389,<|emo_surprise|> OMG this is the first I‚Äôve seen of this. I hate her and I think r/tworeddit can do a better job. Thanks a lot!
7390,<|emo_surprise|> i got a feeling it might have been a bit rushed this time around
7391,<|emo_surprise|> Oh that‚Äôs terrifying
7393,<|emo_surprise|> And there I was blaming [NAME] &!
7394,<|emo_surprise|> I'm a man and you're a girl...
7395,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] I was not expecting him to state he thinks [NAME] is better.
7396,<|emo_surprise|> And if I wasn't already convinced I'd be here writing this. And crying.
7397,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is impressed we are allowing this to happen.
7398,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my gooooood.
7400,<|emo_surprise|> i feel about the situation to be frank i think it s not acceptable
7402,<|emo_surprise|> i feel it is only a matter of time until we get to the bottom of this
7403,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised it's still happening. I was out of state, but I'd be surprised if that's your area."
7404,<|emo_surprise|> i was so excited when i first read that it stuck with me
7405,<|emo_surprise|> Yeah I kinda think I was gonna name the blog [NAME] for all the terrible things I did...
7406,<|emo_surprise|> The man's wife also took it into account when they both voted. #kidding
7407,<|emo_surprise|> wow no wonder people‚Äôs opinion of Reddit is so opinionated.
7408,<|emo_surprise|> Omg so happy for you
7409,<|emo_surprise|> That was a brutal two goal scoring chance for [NAME]
7410,<|emo_surprise|> And they do. They just don't give a fuck about state boundaries.
7411,<|emo_surprise|> How are they not ashamed to have an 8 year old brat in their midst???
7412,"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah, it would be interesting to know how many had to lose in the first two, but I doubt it to be that high."
7413,"<|emo_surprise|> *snerk* Wow, your family must be super rich. *grin*"
7416,<|emo_surprise|> ohhhhh my gosh
7417,<|emo_surprise|> Omg what a harrassment to be called [NAME]
7419,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you took a page out of [NAME] book!"
7420,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I didn't know [NAME] and his wife were best friends with [NAME].
7421,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I'm not seeing any issues at all with my connection
7422,<|emo_surprise|> Wow i had to go watch it
7423,<|emo_surprise|> What did they not realize? The original posting had over 1k upvotes
7424,<|emo_surprise|> I'll add that I've only scoped out coyote hunts in Arizona and Colorado and Utah
7425,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I did not understand the reference
7426,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I‚Äôve never seen so many deleted comments, and that‚Äôs saying something"
7427,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, [NAME] defeated [NAME] "
7431,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that‚Äôs just... wow. Good to know
7432,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh sorry, but that was hilarious! Also, is it weird to call your mom from a different country than she calls from * America?** "
7433,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, she also posted a video of herself driving home, what a bummer. "
7434,<|emo_surprise|> i don t feel that way even now it s so overwhelming that i m honestly shocked i havent lost some
7435,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like thats a more surprising thing
7436,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling dazed over how many minutes i had to read the last few books
7438,"<|emo_surprise|> That's a big meal, healthy guy. "
7439,<|emo_surprise|> I can‚Äôt believe some people don‚Äôt believe [NAME] is a god
7440,<|emo_surprise|> I was surprised to see they had live ammunition.
7441,<|emo_surprise|> You‚Äôre so right :) It‚Äôs a weird way to spell [NAME]. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre okay!
7442,<|emo_surprise|> You‚Äôre cute!
7444,<|emo_surprise|> *Oi he got stabbed in his eye
7445,<|emo_surprise|> Oh no those dreadful things. I dropped them last month. Great pics guys!
7446,<|emo_surprise|> And yet that's what we've been warned about.
7447,<|emo_surprise|> Why do everything look surreal to you?
7448,<|emo_surprise|> That was a hell of a tip...
7449,<|emo_surprise|> Omg this made me LOL
7450,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised that she could operate a suitcase.
7454,<|emo_surprise|> I couldn‚Äôt believe he said that
7455,<|emo_surprise|> Is [NAME] real? I thought he was making impersonations and stuff
7457,<|emo_surprise|> Ah damn!
7458,<|emo_surprise|> Really? I was really trying to think of a crazy example but I was really hard on your analogy. Thanks a lot!
7459,<|emo_surprise|> Omg! What state in OH does that make you?
7460,<|emo_surprise|> i feel very amazed at my power
7461,<|emo_surprise|> Thanks everyone! Have a great weekend.
7462,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh I didn't get there and it was a mistake, sorry if I came off as critical"
7463,<|emo_surprise|> If he gets 2.0 it might have been more telling. But I'm not optimistic
7464,"<|emo_surprise|> What a great photo, what a great story and also what the hell [NAME] said! Wow he's been a great player for us "
7465,<|emo_surprise|> I get this a lot and I wonder just how horrible of a cruelly poetic fact that is.
7466,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you look awesome there"
7468,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] I miss the north hills bottom dollar
7469,"<|emo_surprise|> I had no idea they were charged for the use of their device, but glad to hear it was a non-issue. "
7470,<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs amazing how good of a debater [NAME] actually is lol!
7471,<|emo_surprise|> i could have cried for all that time and been totally fine
7472,"<|emo_surprise|> Oof, is that it?"
7473,<|emo_surprise|> i remember feeling a bit shocked that she was a teacher but im sure i could have guessed a few things
7475,<|emo_surprise|> The comments on that thread are crazy
7476,<|emo_surprise|> i do feel a bit funny about how much things are cheaper here than in uk
7477,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME].. I don‚Äôt even get it :(
7478,<|emo_surprise|> Why the fuck does this exist
7479,<|emo_surprise|> Oh that's so amazing!
7480,<|emo_surprise|> The amount of crap I've seen from him this year is insane.
7481,"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah but some people have that ""we don't have time for this"" attitude all the time..."
7482,"<|emo_surprise|> That's a really good one too. ""How dare you?!"""
7483,<|emo_surprise|> There are some very disturbing videos of recent (incl. this week) residents showing them doing things that seem totally OK to do in the past. I'm shocked he's not appalled by them.
7484,<|emo_surprise|> Omg no way I would miss that!!
7485,"<|emo_surprise|> And in the 1st quarter when they had 39 unanswered points. I don‚Äôt know what the loss was, but it was bad."
7486,"<|emo_surprise|> *Ouch, what did I hit?"
7487,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG. The ""what if [NAME] is a himself"" thing is hilarious."
7490,<|emo_surprise|> omg theyre looking so good. the dude is gonna eat all of us
7491,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised he isn't already on theICYMI.
7493,"<|emo_surprise|> Ah, you're one of them!"
7494,<|emo_surprise|> That sounds so good!
7495,<|emo_surprise|> i think she was just feeling a little overwhelmed
7496,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a bit shocked or slightly amused at the sight of this
7497,<|emo_surprise|> i feel quite impressed by my daughter s ability
7498,<|emo_surprise|> i feel really dazed and confused
7500,<|emo_surprise|> Damn I know some people that can! Love to have a go at it though.
7501,"<|emo_surprise|> So basically what you're saying is the government destroyed evidence, yet the judge didn't sentence him to prison. Fair enough."
7502,<|emo_surprise|> He did say he loves playing [NAME] against the Hawks...
7503,"<|emo_surprise|> The last couple posts have pretty much everything I wanted to see, but I'll miss some. "
7504,<|emo_surprise|> I see the one who is actually in the room haha.
7505,<|emo_surprise|> I feel like I should say something to that... Yes?!
7506,<|emo_surprise|> im just feeling generous and have already thrown in a few more quilts and am waiting to see how the pile responds on the weekend
7507,<|emo_surprise|> What a weird game.
7508,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, now I really am hungry"
7509,<|emo_surprise|> Omg. I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss. Truly a heartbreaking story.
7510,"<|emo_surprise|> Wanna believe he really does do it? I'd hope that, whatever his stated reason is, it's nothing more than a ruse to get attention for his solo effort or other entertainment pursuits"
7511,<|emo_surprise|> i can t help feeling a little dazed while listening
7512,"<|emo_surprise|> Omg yes and no,both for the same reasons, I can‚Äôt imagine thinking someone isn‚Äôt thinking the same :)"
7513,"<|emo_surprise|> Omg i don't know what you're on about, but I whole heartedly agree. Be strong OP! Thanks :)"
7514,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised [NAME] didn't say it was *a game'.
7515,<|emo_surprise|> i feel rather overwhelmed by the work we are doing
7516,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, what a surprise that was!"
7518,<|emo_surprise|> What a find üòÇ
7520,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised it had to be that many up votes...
7521,<|emo_surprise|> i feel pretty overwhelmed
7522,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, never heard of that before"
7523,<|emo_surprise|> i feel shocked and sad that this happened to him
7524,<|emo_surprise|> i love this!
7525,<|emo_surprise|> It all started with this pic
7526,<|emo_surprise|> Oh of course. I haven't watched any previous seasons but I'm pretty sure they got rid of her after she lost her hair.
7527,"<|emo_surprise|> It really isn't that simple, he said."
7528,<|emo_surprise|> Oh that's lovely. Did the link point you to any of the press release videos from ag?
7529,<|emo_surprise|> Ah the high life Ahh the high life
7530,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME]! I thought he was a [NAME] fan!
7531,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I am so glad you like Reddit"
7532,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME], this is awful. "
7533,"<|emo_surprise|> They‚Äôre still not making [NAME] movies, the studio bought it they are trying to sell it! "
7534,<|emo_surprise|> i really do feel funny
7535,<|emo_surprise|> And it was actually *a surprise* to be sure!
7536,<|emo_surprise|> This is how it'll be with a 4-team playoff format
7537,<|emo_surprise|> i didnt really understand how i was feeling or what happened
7538,<|emo_surprise|> Wow I‚Äôm so glad someone else noticed.
7539,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow that's yeezus
7540,<|emo_surprise|> I was more surprised about their socks.
7541,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, by the way, she's just had an operation to remove a tumour from her heart, so expect her out of the picture in a month!"
7542,"<|emo_surprise|> Haha. I agree. I also see the ""cringer"" as a joke. It's just not everyday that someone calls you cringer."
7543,<|emo_surprise|> Well there you go. Maybe it could get interesting if we did.
7544,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, it's been 18 years since I've watched this cringe. It's gotten better every year."
7546,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, my [NAME]"
7548,"<|emo_surprise|> The ""we don't know the source"" part surprised me, but I thought the link was dead for some reason."
7550,<|emo_surprise|> i have the feeling it will be interesting
7552,"<|emo_surprise|> The way those words were worded, it was no accident. The cringe on these sub is incredible."
7553,<|emo_surprise|> Omg! What a nightmare. I came home and I saw you!
7554,<|emo_surprise|> > I'm happy. AHA.
7555,<|emo_surprise|> Ah well thanks for the correction.
7556,"<|emo_surprise|> What a steal, that old man! He thinks it's a $100 bill"
7557,<|emo_surprise|> i feel so amazed that i get to look out from under my mother s swimmingpool
7558,<|emo_surprise|> Wow this is one of the stories I've most been awaiting. So very nice! Thanks for sharing!
7559,"<|emo_surprise|> I have to say, I was surprised at how positive everyone was. I was also a little skeptical. I'm glad I'm not the only one"
7560,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised they haven't done it yet tbh
7561,<|emo_surprise|> I'm just wondering if it's a deal issue or if we're actually allowed a certain amount of freedom in order to make it work.
7562,<|emo_surprise|> i never thought i'd be talking about a girl but im feeling a strange mix of shock and surprise at how good and different our friendship has been over the past week alone
7563,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. I just learned about the spread today on Twitter.
7564,<|emo_surprise|> i feel surprised at the same time why it feels like this
7565,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh damn, I didn't realize the OP wasn't talking to his Mother."
7567,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I never thought of that. Thanks for sharing that about us old hands.
7568,<|emo_surprise|> Omg this is the best
7569,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME]? Just horrible.
7570,<|emo_surprise|> She‚Äôs going to have to work hard to be out there!
7571,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you folks are quite the change agents!"
7572,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling a little skeptical now
7574,<|emo_surprise|> Who has time for those kind of posts. Who ever thought of that?
7575,<|emo_surprise|> Wow what's the club name. I always wondered what that was
7577,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised [NAME] didn't add his FETISH to the movie
7578,<|emo_surprise|> This is the first time I‚Äôve ever disagreed with [NAME] over something that was so obvious
7579,<|emo_surprise|> i feel about dreampo
7580,<|emo_surprise|> This is a shocking report. Confound the toll Trolls are taking on us. May they rest easy as we investigate.
7581,<|emo_surprise|> Well it's a new thing for him to try
7583,<|emo_surprise|> i didnt know what to do and just feel shocked and shocked and some other people did
7584,<|emo_surprise|> i must say it is a wonder i do not feel overwhelmed or over entertained by it all
7585,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. He was more convincing as an actor in The Big Short.
7586,<|emo_surprise|> i see this all the time when i am thinking of ways i can keep my money away from other people and i feel amazing
7588,"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah but I haven't played them, so I can't confirm this but, i think they're pretty cool. They're not terribly shootery though. "
7589,<|emo_surprise|> What a weird situation
7590,"<|emo_surprise|> Yup, he had played his previous games and was completely healthy... it was just bad luck"
7591,<|emo_surprise|> She‚Äôs gorgeous!
7592,<|emo_surprise|> Omg what a gift!
7594,<|emo_surprise|> Yikes. What type of company was that? I thought it was more of a hospitality giant.
7595,<|emo_surprise|> i feel a little bit more amazed
7596,<|emo_surprise|> Oh god what if I was like two years old and I found out I'm actually 40...
7597,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! You‚Äôre so generous with others and yourself! Cheers!
7598,<|emo_surprise|> Wow you're quite the romantic...
7599,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that was an entertaining read"
7600,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you can be so cruel and offensive."
7602,<|emo_surprise|> Oh! *That* is me all the time
7606,<|emo_surprise|> I know but this makes me wonder what would happen if we actually saw him.
7607,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! You‚Äôre so generous with your time. I couldn‚Äôt think of a better gift. Maybe think of something nice for your new room.
7608,<|emo_surprise|> Omg that's so creepy
7609,<|emo_surprise|> I thought someone had come across this and it was a bit of aomer joke
7610,<|emo_surprise|> Hey at least you don't have to worry about it catching fire again.
7611,"<|emo_surprise|> Yikes, a guy in his fifties getting into relationships with his thirties seems kinda creepy. "
7612,<|emo_surprise|> This is the cutest thing I've seen all day.
7613,<|emo_surprise|> Can‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs 6'4 with that attitude.
7614,<|emo_surprise|> There are some amazingly talented people in this sub. I got my first reference song 2 months ago as a kid.
7615,<|emo_surprise|> I'm shocked that nobody posted a Meat thread yet...
7616,<|emo_surprise|> Well this was oddly specific
7617,<|emo_surprise|> Oh that's so creepy.
7618,<|emo_surprise|> And you wonder why he's rich
7619,<|emo_surprise|> It was funny until they started eating people. Unlucky.
7620,"<|emo_surprise|> I thought you said you didn't expect to win lol, not surprised you did after losing a game 6 in your shootout"
7622,<|emo_surprise|> i will tell you are still feeling amazed by how blessed you are with the day to day life you have here
7623,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that‚Äôs actually terrifying. I‚Äôm so lucky that my parents are exactly the same
7624,<|emo_surprise|> He definitely wasn't kidding about the ring... he was just trying to say something that was slightly serious and funny to hear so clearly. Still sad.
7625,<|emo_surprise|> i feel so amazed but also so surprised i couldn t come up with the right words for this
7626,<|emo_surprise|> Holy shit I didn‚Äôt realize he was good
7627,<|emo_surprise|> i actually actually feel surprised and shocked at the amount of support i am getting right now for not trying
7628,<|emo_surprise|> The fuck?
7629,<|emo_surprise|> A surprise turn of events! I'm so glad you called it a day
7631,<|emo_surprise|> How'd you get into the team? That sounds like a great way to get molested.
7632,<|emo_surprise|> How does it feel to get that call?
7633,<|emo_surprise|> He's 40 and single. Maybe even 40 a week now.
7634,<|emo_surprise|> What the actual fuck. I just saw the start of a new sentence. That‚Äôs quite useful!
7635,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Did not know any were until I started Googling.
7636,<|emo_surprise|> What a fucking chad
7637,<|emo_surprise|> Hahaha. I thought I was the only one!
7640,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised [NAME] didn‚Äôt name him [NAME].
7641,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] and [NAME] are the two people I‚Äôm most excited for. I‚Äôd be shocked if [NAME] wasn‚Äôt in on the whole deal
7642,<|emo_surprise|> i do understand that the reason why i feel so doubtful
7643,<|emo_surprise|> You‚Äôre nothing but a cruel human being.
7644,"<|emo_surprise|> I just couldn't imagine an argument between [NAME], [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME]."
7645,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling a bit like a baby
7646,<|emo_surprise|> What a crazy post omg. I really do hope she does well
7647,<|emo_surprise|> What?! It's the best part of this tbh
7648,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I never knew that! I'm so glad I Googled it."
7649,<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs like a meme now
7650,<|emo_surprise|> oh man thats some good words
7651,<|emo_surprise|> *pounces on you* uwu you're so strong and well read haha
7652,<|emo_surprise|> They‚Äôre so afraid
7653,<|emo_surprise|> OMG I didn't know [NAME] made any. I'm a die hard [NAME].
7654,<|emo_surprise|> Oh no! Poor wee thing is probably terrified somewhere.
7655,<|emo_surprise|> i feel so blessed that i am able to meet such amazing and amazing people
7656,<|emo_surprise|> i feel funny when im around other people and have to tell them how i feel
7657,<|emo_surprise|> Really surprising he didn't go for a 3 instead of a 2
7658,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh it is the wrong one, I was honestly going to say it was the left one but then I realized how often it works"
7660,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. This is creepy and weird.
7661,<|emo_surprise|> She looks like an extra over at the bach
7662,<|emo_surprise|> i feel shocked to think how easy it would be for any of us to do that
7663,<|emo_surprise|> *YEAH HE MADE ME CRINGE SO I CRY OVER YOU*
7665,<|emo_surprise|> He's a bit of a mood
7666,"<|emo_surprise|> Haha, thanks"
7667,<|emo_surprise|> omg where did you get your legs mama
7668,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, 4k! Surprised no one else posted that"
7669,<|emo_surprise|> i feel this is my new career field
7670,<|emo_surprise|> i cant really tell if it may be me when i feel skeptical and overwhelmed but i have felt pretty impressed with what has happened so far
7671,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Good thing to know.
7672,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] oh my
7673,<|emo_surprise|> *Fuck I‚Äôm sitting down right now* WHAT THE HELL
7674,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] did he say that? Oh my gosh.
7675,<|emo_surprise|> i was feeling funny the last couple of days
7678,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised he didn't say, ""Oh yeah? Yeah thanks."""
7679,"<|emo_surprise|> I knew this was stupid when it came out, but I didn‚Äôt realize that many others didn‚Äôt see it this way either..."
7680,<|emo_surprise|> Well I was wondering if you could get some other peoples pics. Not sure why I'm talking about you.
7681,<|emo_surprise|> Ah damn it.
7682,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Thank you so much.
7683,<|emo_surprise|> He also has a 2 week old son with his ex wife. And she calls him pathetic.
7684,<|emo_surprise|> i had a feeling i would be feeling pretty surprised
7685,<|emo_surprise|> Wow...is that true? I hope this is a problem for you...
7686,<|emo_surprise|> Oh you are one weirdo huh?
7687,<|emo_surprise|> Damn there are still people out there that think that [NAME] is the greatest coach ever.
7688,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wait that's him.
7689,<|emo_surprise|> Wow is that you?
7690,<|emo_surprise|> How is this any different than people who have 2 jobs and then decide to take time to be with their kids?
7692,<|emo_surprise|> Holy crap. No wonder Amazon won't carry it.
7695,"<|emo_surprise|> I was wondering if it had legs, I'm not convinced the walls are strong enough to hold up a sink or anything."
7696,"<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] is the only other one who was in his 40's, so not too shocked"
7697,<|emo_surprise|> Oh you have your username now?!
7698,<|emo_surprise|> I fucking love that scene.
7699,"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, the phone calls."
7700,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised these people are TBM.
7701,<|emo_surprise|> I'm shocked at how well [NAME] has performed as a gun owner.
7702,<|emo_surprise|> He‚Äôs like [NAME] back inACT
7704,"<|emo_surprise|> Damn, she sounds like [NAME] from My Little Pony."
7705,<|emo_surprise|> Oh I know! That's why I said I see. I just cannot be sure.
7706,<|emo_surprise|> Wow another girl istwitching [NAME] on Twitter
7707,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like i have to be a more self assured person so i need to know how to talk to people and not only me
7708,<|emo_surprise|> You guys doing this kind of trolling? I can't even imagine it.
7709,<|emo_surprise|> Omg! I thought you said it was ok
7711,<|emo_surprise|> OMG she could kill it with a kick
7712,<|emo_surprise|> The lack of regard for other human beings here is heartbreaking.
7713,<|emo_surprise|> i could feel myself losing a good friend
7714,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder how she did it back then
7715,<|emo_surprise|> Wauw! Those guns are awesome!!
7716,"<|emo_surprise|> Omg, amazing that they still use it despite it being unsafe"
7717,"<|emo_surprise|> This is the first I've seen of this. Wow, shocking I hardly knew the city. Thanks."
7718,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh no, they're adding to it..."
7719,<|emo_surprise|> i feel shocked to know he is a doctor
7720,<|emo_surprise|> i can feel that i am on the brink of a beautiful journey that will see me on and through those wonderful days
7721,<|emo_surprise|> The only thing keeping me warm is the lack of anything keeping me from getting killed by freezing air
7723,<|emo_surprise|> Yikes! I didn't think I was that far off from that!
7724,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs my favorite way to spell [NAME]. I was wondering what the inspiration was!
7725,<|emo_surprise|> Oh lord.
7726,<|emo_surprise|> Wow she‚Äôs actually got a new song entitled after her... I‚Äôm shocked she didn‚Äôt pick it up years ago
7727,<|emo_surprise|> He won't even apologize as he's been a good sport about it all these years.
7728,<|emo_surprise|> The irony is that you are supporting and encouraging people to assault and harass people because of who they are and how they act.
7729,<|emo_surprise|> I'm shocked you haven't been banned yet tbh sry
7730,<|emo_surprise|> i would have probably kept the ball but i actually believe he should have made it on a terrific chance too
7731,<|emo_surprise|> i can only think that if i were to be the daughter of a rich politician that i would be feeling rather strange
7732,<|emo_surprise|> This is a weird thing for her to say?
7733,<|emo_surprise|> And they're not alone. More than 1 in 3 college women report unwanted touching from male friends.
7734,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] and [NAME] are my favourite supporting characters inS.
7735,<|emo_surprise|> So glad I moved here.
7736,"<|emo_surprise|> OMG, I didn't know we had a celebrity of [NAME]utely weighin in."
7737,<|emo_surprise|> Omg I want to go there
7738,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] looks like absolute rock god and he‚Äôs fucking destroying it
7739,<|emo_surprise|> oh yesssss.
7740,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, wow. You are strong, friend. "
7741,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh man, the reaction was so strong! "
7742,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh no, the DBS has just sold out for the month. Sorry, I had to go back and checked."
7743,<|emo_surprise|> What? Where did I post it?
7744,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I thought it said 8 years? Wont that be a stretch, sorry."
7745,<|emo_surprise|> What would that be? I love it!
7746,"<|emo_surprise|> Ohhhhh, I didn't realize they had a presence here!!"
7747,<|emo_surprise|> oh [NAME] that's horrifying
7748,<|emo_surprise|> I‚Äôm surprised a fat DnD kid didn‚Äôt name him Lord [NAME]
7749,<|emo_surprise|> I didn't know [NAME] was a swimmer and I didn't know [NAME] had a body.
7750,<|emo_surprise|> This is the first time I‚Äôve ever seen this. I‚Äôm so shocked that he didn‚Äôt get caught
7752,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs a very different answer than why you‚Äôre in jail now.
7753,<|emo_surprise|> wow i did not know that
7754,<|emo_surprise|> i really hope this is true but i m not feeling surprised
7755,<|emo_surprise|> i was like wow i don t know this person or what i did i need to see more and more about this if it had been more of a supportive vibe and it feels like im in some weird fucked up times
7756,<|emo_surprise|> i feel more shocked and amazed that we live in a country where some have the ability to be ignorant
7757,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow she looks so young and healthy, what a surprise. "
7758,<|emo_surprise|> The irony is that we are supporting the militaryJAGs in a time of war where we have nothing to show for it
7759,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, glad nobody called the cops."
7760,<|emo_surprise|> Omg so cringy and funny
7761,<|emo_surprise|> i never feel that much pressure or pressure from the girls
7763,"<|emo_surprise|> This makes me so happy. So, so happy!"
7764,<|emo_surprise|> Yeah my little [NAME]. He gets it and takes it well.
7765,<|emo_surprise|> She forgot to OHKO
7768,<|emo_surprise|> No problem! I‚Äôm sure they want him gone but just for now. Good to know they are understanding of our situation... :)
7769,<|emo_surprise|> Lol. Thanks for the correction. 
7771,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder why we haven‚Äôt seen the last of this hater.
7772,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, it was *all* in there"
7773,<|emo_surprise|> Damn..
7774,<|emo_surprise|> Well I'd say a couple things. Fuck off
7775,<|emo_surprise|> I'm so happy for you!
7776,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling very apprehensive about it
7777,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow, I cringed hard"
7778,<|emo_surprise|> How the fuck do you moan tho
7779,<|emo_surprise|> Can't relate. I'm almost 30. Feels like my 30ish is a teen / 20ish. The sadness just keeps on coming.
7780,<|emo_surprise|> What a story
7781,"<|emo_surprise|> A surprise, honestly"
7782,<|emo_surprise|> i feel like a strange one
7783,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I was totally wondering what that was..."
7784,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] that was a terrible call
7785,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, I'm wondering what happened?"
7789,<|emo_surprise|> i could feel myself getting overwhelmed
7790,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] I HAD KNOW
7791,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if there's a special sauce for duck that's supposed to turn it white in there.
7792,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you must have no idea what state you're in."
7793,<|emo_surprise|> Wow there is something genuinely fascinating going on in here...
7796,<|emo_surprise|> Really? Like I thought the guy was an extra on the court
7797,"<|emo_surprise|> Yup, and while I was surprised to see he has a degree in computer science and maybe not that much of a background in gaming, I'm glad he had a job interview"
7798,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh gosh! I was about to give my card to an old woman but I thought to get the other one, the old woman gave it to a man too!"
7799,<|emo_surprise|> Oh man that is the weirdest thing I've ever heard
7801,<|emo_surprise|> How did they find the picture? I'm pretty dumb but I've never seen a search result for pics like this before.
7802,"<|emo_surprise|> It‚Äôs really, really scary, yeah, and I‚Äôd do anything for you. Please stay strong, [NAME] "
7803,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that‚Äôs just crazy that he‚Äôs even talking to media about this
7804,<|emo_surprise|> > I know she's a terrible politician lol lol
7806,<|emo_surprise|> Yeah I was thinking it was kinda sad how much I didn't even want the top pics.
7809,<|emo_surprise|> Wow omg yes
7810,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm 6'0"" and 170 pounds....my mom also is, and she's 5'11"". So there is a slight majority in her corner haha."
7812,<|emo_surprise|> Oh yah that
7813,<|emo_surprise|> That's amazing! Thanks yourself for sharing. I'll certainly be back and add it if you ever want it ;)
7814,<|emo_surprise|> im not feeling the least bit thrilled by this
7815,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling weird
7816,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, didn't know that was even a thing."
7817,<|emo_surprise|> i could cry just from watching this video and feel absolutely ecstatic
7818,<|emo_surprise|> omg was it [NAME]? i remember her sooo good in this!!!
7819,<|emo_surprise|> Wow that‚Äôs just crazy. Could you imagine a scenario where we actually lose to the Leafs next year (loss nw)
7820,<|emo_surprise|> Really? What was your response? You should at least make some sense out of it.
7821,<|emo_surprise|> That's weird to be honest.
7822,<|emo_surprise|> i remember feeling overwhelmed by the feeling that had overwhelmed me the first week
7825,<|emo_surprise|> Oh no!!!!!!!
7826,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh I didn't realize you said ""the same thing"" and she was surprised you said it."
7827,<|emo_surprise|> Oh man. Those comments were both extremely cringy andark.
7828,<|emo_surprise|> Really? The only difference would be his shirt was unlined.
7829,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! I‚Äôve never seen anything like this. What a find
7830,<|emo_surprise|> What a crazy year to be a [NAME] fan
7831,"<|emo_surprise|> Really took me by surprise, but yes, I agree. He is a very interesting dude. "
7833,<|emo_surprise|> How are the flashbacks truthful? I can‚Äôt get past the fact that the flashbacks are flashbacks
7834,<|emo_surprise|> Wow this seems like an unusual thread to post...
7836,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling rather overwhelmed with all the stuff that i have to do and what i need to do
7837,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh no, my turn came around the same time"
7839,<|emo_surprise|> She‚Äôs a weirdo
7840,<|emo_surprise|> i hope i m not going to feel overwhelmed about it
7841,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME]!!!!
7843,<|emo_surprise|> I am surprised [NAME] let her do this
7846,<|emo_surprise|> im feeling more and more overwhelmed with it and wonder if she has any sense of self control
7847,<|emo_surprise|> She was wearing heels in that picture!
7848,<|emo_surprise|> i do not use the Internet for anything i feel very reluctant
7849,<|emo_surprise|> Oh god it's actually me! I don't know why but I swear it's the only thing I've been thinking about lately.
7850,<|emo_surprise|> i feel strange
7851,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow. I didn't know that they were that big of fans.
7852,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs even more terrifying tbh
7853,<|emo_surprise|> i could go on about the amazing things in my life because after all i feel like i have to give it time for being a human being
7855,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh look, it's Gotay!"
7856,<|emo_surprise|> This is an interesting bit of background on how the tax code works...
7857,<|emo_surprise|> oh you have a new friend in the game
7860,<|emo_surprise|> i wonder what else can i write on there
7862,<|emo_surprise|> Oh shit. Are you in New York?
7863,<|emo_surprise|> If we get a 1st rounder that makes us worse we would be happy.
7864,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, that's a lot of karma. Good for her!"
7865,<|emo_surprise|> You are crazy
7866,<|emo_surprise|> i got home and began looking through my house and wonder if they were all still inside i had a moment of panic feeling that couldnt wait to run out into the field with him
7867,"<|emo_surprise|> No wonder he canair it, it's like a flying kong"
7868,<|emo_surprise|> This is so scary. Stay safe!
7869,"<|emo_surprise|> wow, how did he just eat all of that?"
7870,<|emo_surprise|> So I went to the trouble to call them just to say nice stuff about them and to apologize that I was feeling their way of course they wouldn‚Äôt get it
7871,<|emo_surprise|> How did they know exactly what you were thinking by reading your Reddit karma history
7872,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] a fucken metahuman
7873,"<|emo_surprise|> Hey! I play the lottery every week-a-thousand of times in my day, and still win!"
7874,"<|emo_surprise|> Omg, yucks..."
7876,<|emo_surprise|> The third picture looks like a poorly drawn drawing.
7877,<|emo_surprise|> OMG this Extreme Love commercial. Yikes.
7878,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, your sister is actually a pornstar. "
7879,<|emo_surprise|> What a weird thing to say. I‚Äôd be more than happy to show some pride for a little while.
7880,"<|emo_surprise|> Thanks, I didn't know about that story and it was awesome to hear it!"
7884,"<|emo_surprise|> So true. I've lost count of the number of times people have come up to me and said ""I hope you have a better day today""."
7886,<|emo_surprise|> oh wow that's awesome! i think i've discovered my new love
7887,<|emo_surprise|> What a shocker.
7888,"<|emo_surprise|> It's a funny thing, she seems to really enjoy going out with men and not dating."
7889,<|emo_surprise|> Oh for sure. He might have a point. I agree with much of what he said but I can't help but wonder if [NAME] can handle the pressure of being so high.
7890,<|emo_surprise|> Is it an article? Or a short video?
7892,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder where that picture was taken.
7893,<|emo_surprise|> Just imagine the shock and awe he'd get if you actually said that!
7894,<|emo_surprise|> i dont know where it came from but it feels genuinely strange
7895,<|emo_surprise|> Wow. Never thought of that. I‚Äôm so glad I live in Cali
7897,<|emo_surprise|> Oh god did this just get any WORSE THAN last night!!
7898,<|emo_surprise|> Omg I've never seen this before hahah
7899,<|emo_surprise|> Oh wow I think I'm in love
7900,<|emo_surprise|> This is kinda amazing
7901,<|emo_surprise|> i wonder if it would have been as clever if he only did it and only made one
7902,<|emo_surprise|> How are you a man without a woman? I'm not sure what to say to that one.
7903,<|emo_surprise|> My [NAME] I had no idea my [NAME] had a son
7904,<|emo_surprise|> i know sometimes when i feel i am on the verge of being overwhelmed and helpless
7905,<|emo_surprise|> My fucking mind
7907,"<|emo_surprise|> Haha, and that's the first I've heard of him threatening to sue. "
7909,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm shocked that he didn't say, ""I want to come home and be with my family!"" "
7910,<|emo_surprise|> Well at least he didn‚Äôt try to eat the last bits!
7911,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised they didn't name it [NAME]
7912,<|emo_surprise|> A ha ha Ha
7913,<|emo_surprise|> There's no limit when it comes to owning dogs. Some dogs get even more crazy when they age.
7915,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh look, it's actually the other Reddit account!"
7917,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you're welcome"
7918,<|emo_surprise|> My lord! You did it!
7919,<|emo_surprise|> Wow so you actually have some sense of humor lol. What an oddity
7920,<|emo_surprise|> OMG! I almost forgot about that episode. I love it.
7921,<|emo_surprise|> Oh [NAME] what a surprise...
7922,<|emo_surprise|> So. Damn. Greasy.
7923,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you guys are crazy"
7924,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh wait, was that [NAME]?"
7925,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you people are really horrible. "
7926,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs a really good question. I‚Äôm not a sociologist but I‚Äôd love to hear something more general.
7927,<|emo_surprise|> Oh look a player breaking out
7929,<|emo_surprise|> Omg I literally can‚Äôt believe she used the N-word.
7930,<|emo_surprise|> i feel more amazed than ever that i am allowed to be myself
7931,<|emo_surprise|> i feel strange that theyre trying to make me feel like a person that is being less than generous
7932,<|emo_surprise|> Whoa there‚Äôs a lot more in store for [NAME]..
7933,<|emo_surprise|> Wow you‚Äôre amazing
7935,"<|emo_surprise|> I have the opposite problem, but I can easily picture people saying: ‚Äúit's not my fault! It's your husband's!‚Äù"
7936,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs beyond fucking creepy...
7937,<|emo_surprise|> OMG no wonder this is a thing.
7938,<|emo_surprise|> Oh man. Did not even realise they were vegan. They were shocked I have more than one follower on Reddit.
7939,"<|emo_surprise|> Yeah, I was going to say that, but because that was a really recent conversation conversation topic."
7940,<|emo_surprise|> oh umm
7941,<|emo_surprise|> I've never seen a more ridiculous crowd!
7942,<|emo_surprise|> i feel quite amazed just by seeing such wonders around me
7943,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh no, [NAME] has found his voice!"
7944,<|emo_surprise|> I just got a free 30 day trial and now I have to wait until chunk offer ends to use it?
7945,<|emo_surprise|> Oh my [NAME] wow
7946,"<|emo_surprise|> Haha, good point! It does surprise me how big that issue is in Canada."
7947,<|emo_surprise|> There's a reason [NAME] got his start at WCC and the expectation is he'll play his entire career there.
7948,<|emo_surprise|> I'm surprised he didn't say that when asked about his relationship with [NAME].
7949,<|emo_surprise|> i have no idea what they are about and I feel less than thrilled that i met them
7950,<|emo_surprise|> That's just... wow. I'm shocked he didn't add in a swear word.
7951,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow. ""Bethlehem police chief"" is not a job, it's a license to kill. "
7952,<|emo_surprise|> Lol! I thought she was being a bit dramatic....
7954,<|emo_surprise|> I feel that way too. I'd be surprised if he kept it up this long.
7955,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, more abuse of power!"
7957,<|emo_surprise|> Just because some people care and don't want to discuss it? Get out now
7958,<|emo_surprise|> *dramatic shake-out* Omg!!
7959,<|emo_surprise|> > it doesn't happen all that often but I have. Fearing it.
7960,"<|emo_surprise|> Wow, you're not wrong about most of the details."
7963,<|emo_surprise|> OMG this baby has big splay. I LOVE this!!!
7964,<|emo_surprise|> oh my gosh...
7966,<|emo_surprise|> i feel very overwhelmed
7967,<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs a strange way to spell [NAME]
7969,<|emo_surprise|> OMG dad! I thought I was alone!
7971,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh my word, she's gorgeous!"
7972,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder why the fuck off.
7973,<|emo_surprise|> [NAME] a real boy!
7974,"<|emo_surprise|> So, you didn't kill her?"
7977,<|emo_surprise|> I find myself saying the exact same thing over and over again to try to keep a straight face ‚ò∫
7978,<|emo_surprise|> Oh no. Look at the shoes.
7979,<|emo_surprise|> How did you actually film this?
7980,<|emo_surprise|> Yeah [NAME] is scary as all hell
7982,<|emo_surprise|> She's an amazing and incredibly powerful woman. [NAME] would love her.
7983,<|emo_surprise|> Oh. Right.
7984,"<|emo_surprise|> Oh, god, no wonder people complain about too much free food."
7985,<|emo_surprise|> And the 4th? Who didn't see him score that?
7987,<|emo_surprise|> i am feeling a little overwhelmed
7988,<|emo_surprise|> No! That‚Äôs horrible!...I just got a little bit of a scare from a few questions...
7989,<|emo_surprise|> i also feel like i m a bit surprised that i don t feel like there are any blogs or news articles about us
7990,"<|emo_surprise|> Who even watches reality tv? That's what the whole point of it is, to bring awareness to the matter of race"
7991,"<|emo_surprise|> I'm literally a few words in from being 5'11"". This is freakin' insane."
7994,"<|emo_surprise|> That‚Äôs wild, I‚Äôm very happy for you, it‚Äôs crazy how things can go so incredibly wrong for so many people "
7995,<|emo_surprise|> What a fucking dumbass.
7996,<|emo_surprise|> I wonder if they got nervous when they saw he has a degree in engineering.
7998,<|emo_surprise|> Wow! Did not expect to find such AO community! Good guys and good games!
7999,<|emo_surprise|> No it literally looks like a checkmark next to my name even though i don‚Äôt post anything to Reddit
