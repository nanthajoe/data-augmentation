104,<|emo_fear|> What a disgusting list
105,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless and helpless
106,"<|emo_fear|> My fault too, I didn't realize they used standard height and spacing for all their characters except Grumpy Old Man and the Kid."
107,<|emo_fear|> There’s the odd post about how the [NAME] hate is building and there’s been this thread of people whining about how noone is saying anything yet.
109,<|emo_fear|> i don t want to be this way about the whole thing but in the world of children it is a much greater worry
110,<|emo_fear|> I am scared of losing more weight. At least I hope this goes away :(
111,<|emo_fear|> i feel kinda shaky today
112,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to start writing on a gloomy note for fear of burdening others with this gloomy fate
114,"<|emo_fear|> I’m a little worried about making one, but also a little hopeful that you are"

134,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure or anxious

136,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure and even more anxious often
137,"<|emo_fear|> The sad thing is, it's very likely you are right and it's entirely your fault...of which you are a part."
138,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to write about this
139,<|emo_fear|> i also feel skeptical
140,<|emo_fear|> i had a feeling he was going to throw in some nasty words about how im not good now i didnt want to put much thought into things
141,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im about to get so overwhelmed and it could easily happen at this point but this is a great opportunity to be reminded to focus on what is important and take time out of your life to reflect on those
142,<|emo_fear|> You're ugly.
143,<|emo_fear|> I'm having the same trouble I had with the new characters. All my friends are really likeable until [NAME] shows up.
144,<|emo_fear|> The “sad [NAME]” and “sad [NAME]” [NAME] music was so awful in this episode its fantastic
145,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] is scary

155,<|emo_fear|> The fact this is written on notebook paper...isn’t surprising tbh
156,<|emo_fear|> You're creepy
157,<|emo_fear|> i have trouble sleeping in my sweat because after about hour im going to be awake the whole time even if i feel asleep
158,<|emo_fear|> I know it's terrible to say this but I’m losing sleep wondering what [NAME]’s up to
159,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid to walk alone
160,<|emo_fear|> this is terrifying
161,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared anxious or angry
162,<|emo_fear|> im pretty shaky right now so i should feel ok
163,<|emo_fear|> ive feeling really agitated for no reason because im sitting in it all the time and i cant do anything right
164,<|emo_fear|> What a weird thing to say.
165,<|emo_fear|> i was still feeling the shock of what had just happened and wondering if this would ever mean anything because we are all innocent as hell
166,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling skeptical about it
167,<|emo_fear|> Damn that’s a good one 😟
168,<|emo_fear|> im afraid to let you in on many things sometimes though and i feel a little bit reluctant about sharing that information

170,<|emo_fear|> I feel afraid when he does that
171,<|emo_fear|> It’s actually a rather unpleasant shower. Very cold.
172,<|emo_fear|> That damn wink slayed me. Swoon so hard you think dreams are reality.
173,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid and helpless
174,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless and i feel as though i cant do anything right
175,<|emo_fear|> i feel this is a dangerous game to play into too much territory
176,<|emo_fear|> i just got back from my last treatment which was pretty horrendous which left me feeling quite shaken and scared
177,"<|emo_fear|> i know i might feel a little paranoid on account of this, but i feel that it s my duty to remain within my walls protect it"
178,<|emo_fear|> i get worried that i can t be assured that what i am feeling is true
179,<|emo_fear|> Oh my gosh. I'm so sorry.
180,<|emo_fear|> My condolences.
181,<|emo_fear|> That's scary. I hope the man who shot him later died. A lot of shootings like that are never reported.
182,<|emo_fear|> i feel as if im so uncertain of myself now
183,<|emo_fear|> of cinder blocks
184,<|emo_fear|> I'm worried they have a terrible response rate.
185,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared the things i do that i know to be safe are not to be trusted

194,<|emo_fear|> i love that hes so calm sometimes
195,<|emo_fear|> i can feel a bit of panic and anxiety sitting here now that the first one is back
196,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling pretty overwhelmed
197,<|emo_fear|> This is why we all love Netflix. Their customer service is terrible.
198,<|emo_fear|> i feel vulnerable when i go outside
199,<|emo_fear|> I was afraid of that too. I thought I was the only one.
200,<|emo_fear|> It happens way more than you think. People are repulsive.
201,<|emo_fear|> It’s a cruel thing to say to someone with depression.
202,"<|emo_fear|> My heart skips a beat when [NAME] talks about how his mother has given him a hard time as a child, what a sad story. "
203,<|emo_fear|> i feel somewhat helpless to change things
204,<|emo_fear|> im feeling uncertain sometimes
205,<|emo_fear|> i know i was hesitant but now that i feel more strongly that i want this to be my only career choice i feel quite convinced that it will not be
206,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure of which is worse because i feel like thats the only thing thats really happened
207,<|emo_fear|> that's awful
208,"<|emo_fear|> I'm not sure about, but now I'm really scared."
209,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling a bit nervous about whether or not i could use my new skills
210,<|emo_fear|> i do not have a fixed point in society of being submissive
211,<|emo_fear|> I heard it when I was a kid and thought it was scary. Very similar to this. I want to die
212,<|emo_fear|> i still feel unsure about how i am on all of these levels
213,<|emo_fear|> i feel so helpless most of the time
214,<|emo_fear|> *hugs you* No I'm crying You're my rock
215,<|emo_fear|> i did feel reluctant to try the second one but after some discussion it was decided we wanted to try it
216,<|emo_fear|> My [NAME] what's your deal? I love your answer.
217,<|emo_fear|> i feel completely terrified
218,<|emo_fear|> It would be so terrifying because we have so many social outcasts and it's such a shame.
219,"<|emo_fear|> Oof, sorry for my bad English"
220,<|emo_fear|> i get a feeling that he is going to be pressured and there will be many more than i am comfortable with
221,<|emo_fear|> This is a very worrying sign.
222,<|emo_fear|> this is scary
223,<|emo_fear|> i feel more anxious than ever
224,<|emo_fear|> ive kept up a series of posts over the past two days on many things being said about me and i was wondering if anyone would find this blog on the internet and if anyone would come and contact me if they had any suggestions about where this blog might fit in
225,<|emo_fear|> So she was going to die! I’d like to see this.
226,<|emo_fear|> im still too emo for her and feeling very nervous about it
227,<|emo_fear|> i woke up feeling very distressed and scared
228,<|emo_fear|> this is scary and so very sad... leave this person and her babies with a loving caring adult
229,<|emo_fear|> *]How?..* Because it's a terrible idea. What if the goalposts were on an inclined plane?
230,<|emo_fear|> oh damn
231,<|emo_fear|> i have a feeling i will have my life in such a messed up state
232,<|emo_fear|> i began to feel overwhelmed and i began to fear that sometimes i was going to cry
233,<|emo_fear|> i can feel scared and helpless and without any protectors
234,<|emo_fear|> You miss everything about him except the skin and hair he gets in the movies
235,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling fairly terrified of having a baby

242,<|emo_fear|> i feel agitated when i am around a group of people
243,<|emo_fear|> i feel like it s doomed because these things i think will really make a difference to people are just not happening
244,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling apprehensive and anxious too

253,<|emo_fear|> Ouch. Can’t imagine thinking that.
254,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant to post this again though
255,"<|emo_fear|> The only thing that stopped her from walking into the store was a single lighted cigarette butt, what a nightmare."
256,<|emo_fear|> im feeling pretty insecure all the time
257,<|emo_fear|> i actually feel nervous anxious and frustrated and disappointed that everything might go wrong and that god can actually do incredible things
258,<|emo_fear|> What a nightmare.
259,<|emo_fear|> im not sure if this is a blessing in disguise but i feel that there is more to a trusting nature that s not something that i can rely on
260,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little apprehensive about it
261,<|emo_fear|> How incredibly dangerous.
262,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel that there s any chance in hell that i ll be disturbed if i do
263,<|emo_fear|> i felt hesitant in saying this so i could give you advice on how to approach your new situation which may also be a new approach i feel uncertain about
264,<|emo_fear|> i feel paranoid i go online to look at what other girls are wearing
265,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid because i have no idea where to start

267,<|emo_fear|> It still seems dangerous
268,"<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid I'll pick something else, or maybe I'm a prude because I'm not exactly enamoured with [NAME]."
269,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling very uncertain about everything i said above
270,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling a little apprehensive about the project since i feel it will not be easy for me

303,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure of myself
304,<|emo_fear|> i am a pretty normal human being so i feel quite skeptical of all these claims but i am convinced by the evidence and by what is often said and done

333,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling insecure and scared about me
334,<|emo_fear|> i feel shy to talk to people because im usually afraid of them
335,<|emo_fear|> i feel suspicious or paranoid
336,<|emo_fear|> > The fact that there's such a large gap between rich and poor is a huge problem.
337,<|emo_fear|> i feel very anxious and worried
338,<|emo_fear|> I honestly do hope no one gets hurt as a result of this accident. The townspeople are probably going to come out in droves to defend themselves..
339,<|emo_fear|> im saying i feel pretty unsure about most of this
340,<|emo_fear|> ohhhhh it
341,<|emo_fear|> That’s a horrible take. I’m sorry for your loss.
342,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im terrified to death of saying it
343,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a bit reluctant to tell him
344,<|emo_fear|> My advice would be to find a woman who loves you and end it while you still can. Stay with her until you find a woman who loves you and won't ruin it for you. 
345,<|emo_fear|> Your age difference is incredibly creepy.
346,<|emo_fear|> I don't see any of the issues
347,<|emo_fear|> >it's terrifying Who's afraid of the future? They're scared of the present
348,<|emo_fear|> i still feel a bit overwhelmed
349,<|emo_fear|> i feel extremely helpless and totally helpless to stop her
350,<|emo_fear|> That’s horrible. You can think for yourself lol
351,<|emo_fear|> i feel intimidated
352,<|emo_fear|> i have a feeling he might be looking over his shoulder the moment he steps into the arena
353,<|emo_fear|> i feel a few apprehensions and apprehensions go away as i sit here writing out a few thoughts and feelings about this
354,<|emo_fear|> i feel frightened to come home i ve never felt this before and im terrified to let it happen again
355,<|emo_fear|> i feel less frantic because i m writing the book i m a bit of a romantic
356,<|emo_fear|> i feel so scared out loud right now im not sure i even want to sleep
357,<|emo_fear|> I'll always put myself in the woman's shoes. I have trust issues and have yet to hear a woman complain about something men commit.
358,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless as he is trying to keep me alive and well for as long as he can to see if i know whats whats wrong with us all
359,<|emo_fear|> i began to become aware of how i was feeling i began to question myself why have i spent so much time worrying and worrying
360,<|emo_fear|> i was very afraid to ask him out but he assured me i would have to be. he was sweet of me and i thought that was how he would know that i would never dare question him again.
361,<|emo_fear|> i feel apprehensive and anxious
362,<|emo_fear|> Oh my [NAME] that's terrible!
363,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling a bit reluctant
364,"<|emo_fear|> She has two sons, a healthy pregnancy, and a career!"
365,<|emo_fear|> i feel so unsure and afraid
366,<|emo_fear|> This is kinda sad. The beauty of nature is that she breaks you down a bit.
367,<|emo_fear|> i feel pressured by the amount of work which i need to do to get my exams in
368,<|emo_fear|> I’m sorry man sounds bad. Man I think you were just going too hard on him tonight. He was my main focus for the game and he failed really big time.
369,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little paranoid about starting
370,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little overwhelmed
371,<|emo_fear|> i started to feel very helpless and lost
372,<|emo_fear|> I remember hearing that story and being really scared that I would become that way.
373,"<|emo_fear|> Yeah, but you're wrong. What's your proof?"
374,<|emo_fear|> I'm so scared to ask but did anyone reply?
375,<|emo_fear|> i just feel shy to talk about it
376,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to put it into words because i know it only slightly better than i fear
377,<|emo_fear|> i feel pressured to just tell you there is a huge amount of anxiety around everything i do
378,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling nervous this morning too
379,<|emo_fear|> i feel skeptical about her
380,<|emo_fear|> i was going to come back to it but i feel like i am too frightened to leave the school
381,<|emo_fear|> i feel so vulnerable now i think it also might be my fault
382,<|emo_fear|> i feel like i need to be afraid enough now before i go to sleep
383,<|emo_fear|> i do sometimes feel scared of where im going to end up in the end of my term
384,<|emo_fear|> i feel very anxious and anxious about taking more exams now
385,<|emo_fear|> He's too afraid to take his own life.
386,<|emo_fear|> i feel kind of strange
387,<|emo_fear|> i feel more shaky than ever now
388,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant about trusting anyone
389,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to take part
390,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a bit more apprehensive but all in good fun
391,<|emo_fear|> i feel pretty nervous about it
392,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling anxious and anxious
393,<|emo_fear|> i feel more fearful now because of my fear i can no longer do something that i once wanted to do
394,<|emo_fear|> I was scared of it too. I thought I was the only one. Now I'm on it.
395,<|emo_fear|> i think we are too scared and insecure to face the truth that its a lie
396,<|emo_fear|> I still have a hard time sleeping in socks. They go right through my sock.
397,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling anxious as i was trying to find a cheaper way out of there just a little bit more quickly
398,"<|emo_fear|> When my mom's room was full of posters of [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME]"
399,<|emo_fear|> That sounds terrible.
400,<|emo_fear|> i feel frightened and helpless by it all
401,<|emo_fear|> oh [NAME]...
403,<|emo_fear|> i still feel a little skeptical about the claims of him and others
404,<|emo_fear|> i felt very anxious and was very sad
405,"<|emo_fear|> ""Eating ice cream is supposed to cause weight loss so I feel guilty for craving it while pregnant."" Sounds awful."
406,<|emo_fear|> i feel that there is the potential that i could be dangerous in my own home
407,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling a little frightened because i dont know what is going to happen
408,<|emo_fear|> i got a better understanding of feeling nervous and then anxious and then terrified
409,<|emo_fear|> of course i was. what a nightmare
410,<|emo_fear|> The last one made me feel like screaming
411,<|emo_fear|> That is awful news. :(
412,<|emo_fear|> im feeling quite shaky about this
413,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im getting very terrified about it and its not resolved and that makes me a little less vulnerable
414,<|emo_fear|> This one is my all time favorite RIP
415,<|emo_fear|> i still feel frightened i am glad i called her my mommy and that makes me feel a little more assured
416,<|emo_fear|> >I was once forced into a sex act by a drunkard who was furious that I didn’t put him inside the whorehouse.
417,<|emo_fear|> This is the saddest thing I've seen on this thread yet
418,<|emo_fear|> The only bad thing is the car.
419,<|emo_fear|> Ooooh wow!
420,<|emo_fear|> This is so scary. I can’t imagine. What is the government doing to these poor children?
421,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling a little nervous as of late
422,<|emo_fear|> i feel so helpless that im willing to suffer for it
423,"<|emo_fear|> So basically you have two responses to this, which is sad."
424,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to go back and i feel that hes afraid to open up about issues where he has been wronged
425,"<|emo_fear|> It was such a terrible turn of events. Scary, tbh. I'm glad that the man responsible is getting help."
426,"<|emo_fear|> Omg why would you say that, he's a terrible coach"
427,<|emo_fear|> im feeling more wimpy than expected tonight
428,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] I fear the day [NAME] steps foot on Scottish soil in decades.
429,<|emo_fear|> i feel uncertain and afraid of what happened
430,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to write too much about the story because i feel that its too uncertain
431,<|emo_fear|> Oh [NAME]... I think I just read the introduction by volume! So many terrible things.
432,<|emo_fear|> i could just be a friend of anyone you know or it took way more effort for me to feel insecure about something
433,<|emo_fear|> *pounces on you* uwu you’re really gone now *cries in north america*
434,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling pretty anxious about my birthday this month but now i am here and we are getting in the act
436,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit like a reluctant wizard
437,<|emo_fear|> He actually had a stroke reading this
438,<|emo_fear|> And the guy who works for them told us today that his boss told him that he needs to be more careful about his spending.
439,<|emo_fear|> i feel paranoid as i type but i think youll hear much the same thing
440,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling more fearful than before
441,<|emo_fear|> My worst fear is catching an illness that will kill me in the future.
442,<|emo_fear|> Well that’s terrifying... I hope you’re okay. :(
443,<|emo_fear|> This is disgusting.
444,<|emo_fear|> I thought [NAME] had a bit of a gaba scare when she came on. She really struggled and I thought she might faint
445,<|emo_fear|> i feel extremely skeptical i still think there is a chance for it to work
446,<|emo_fear|> i also feel very skeptical about it
447,"<|emo_fear|> As a [NAME], I am appalled that this is still happening. "
448,<|emo_fear|> i feel like he is trying not to be too frantic
449,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling a tad apprehensive about it
450,<|emo_fear|> That's so horrifying. But you're 16 and so are 2.6 billion other people. It's all really frightening.
451,<|emo_fear|> This is terrifying.
452,<|emo_fear|> i feel like i m always vulnerable to the world and vulnerable to myself
453,<|emo_fear|> i feel suspicious at times and afraid
454,<|emo_fear|> I'm sorry that the image you're looking for isn't available. What I'm looking for is [NAME] with a big ol sousaphone
455,<|emo_fear|> i honestly fear it is the worst game in the world
456,<|emo_fear|> i feel that i need to find a way of doing it that feels safe and assured
457,<|emo_fear|> im feeling quite nervous
458,"<|emo_fear|> > They're scared of how much money they make. Well I'm not sure I'd call that ""cautious"". Just terrible people"
459,<|emo_fear|> That’s one of the scariest things I’ve read on here. She could’ve easily killed by pushing so hard
460,<|emo_fear|> i felt a little intimidated as much as i feel intimidated by big books or the world of ken quinn
461,<|emo_fear|> i feel terrified and helpless
462,<|emo_fear|> That's horrible. :( My condolences.
463,<|emo_fear|> i feel so unsure and anxious
464,<|emo_fear|> im feeling slightly paranoid im wondering which one has the mike up on the speaker or whether im the only one that has that problem
466,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite nervous about doing so though
467,<|emo_fear|> How dangerous. He could very well use it to his advantage. I'm afraid to imagine that
468,"<|emo_fear|> The only sad thing to come out of this is that there is actually some good here. Sorry, [NAME] :-("
469,<|emo_fear|> The fact that a woman who's done nothing wrong is afraid to speak out makes me fear for our democracy.
470,<|emo_fear|> I feel this is one of the least scary things I've ever seen. It looks like an old horror movie made into a preschool.
472,<|emo_fear|> So you're an animal lover who hates society. Interesting.
473,<|emo_fear|> A little girl with a creepy smile? Who was she?
474,<|emo_fear|> I know it’s terrible PR and I’m horrible for the city but are they really that stupid?
475,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little apprehensive about my future
476,<|emo_fear|> When you're in a car accident you might be scared of going back or not coming home
477,<|emo_fear|> i had been feeling quite anxious going into the day of the race at college
478,<|emo_fear|> i feel more timid now
479,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid
480,<|emo_fear|> i could do a lot more blogging and it just feels really weird doing as many posts as i do right now
481,<|emo_fear|> In the US it’s very rare that a young adult falls pregnant out of wedlock
482,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling very afraid of going to the bathroom
483,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling terrified anxious and confused but it was the work that was truly hard
485,<|emo_fear|> im feeling quite apprehensive about going alone
486,<|emo_fear|> They're scared of press
487,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling quite uncertain about her
488,<|emo_fear|> I miss him w/ the creme brûlées :(
489,<|emo_fear|> i feel anxious to get over it
490,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling nervous anxious and anxious for a reason
491,<|emo_fear|> The only acceptable response to hateful speech is more hateful speech. It's sad that society still prizes speech over actions.
492,<|emo_fear|> I'm scared I'll become that kind of parent lol
493,<|emo_fear|> i feel apprehensive about it because i feel so safe i feel assured of myself
494,<|emo_fear|> i honestly feel terrified as the hours go by
495,<|emo_fear|> Not one bit racist. Just tired of seeing horror stories of similarity.
496,<|emo_fear|> im feeling shaken up the last couple months
497,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling kinda overwhelmed lately
499,<|emo_fear|> i had just finished feeling unsure and it wasnt until i left that evening for the morning that i knew i was in for a terrifying experience
500,"<|emo_fear|> Well, that's interesting to hear you say that. I think it's quite possible"
501,<|emo_fear|> i feel overwhelmed
502,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little reluctant to recommend this book to my fellow writers but with the wonderful cover and cover art a href http www
504,<|emo_fear|> i thought i had been in a pretty dangerous place but it wasnt dangerous after all
505,<|emo_fear|> This is horrible
506,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a bit anxious and worried
507,<|emo_fear|> i would feel so uncomfortable
509,<|emo_fear|> i could feel myself getting agitated and just didnt sleep well last night
510,<|emo_fear|> I remember a man being hospitalised for life after suffering a stroke as a young patient.
511,"<|emo_fear|> Because, seriously? I feel there are more important things to be worrying about than an uncertain roster spot."
512,<|emo_fear|> This is so scary but true
514,<|emo_fear|> Oh no he didn't
515,<|emo_fear|> i want to be perfect i want to be completely happy and terrified
516,<|emo_fear|> That was truly disgusting. Can anyone send amp or sound system to a recently destroyed house? Everyone will miss out 
517,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure of myself on a daily basis as a child
518,<|emo_fear|> i dont think it might be possible for me to do but i feel very uncertain about my future in life
519,<|emo_fear|> i feel like i need to be more careful how i phrased in these comments it could be unfortunate if i did
520,<|emo_fear|> Oh no that poor sap
521,"<|emo_fear|> We'll find out soon enough though, and it'll be painful"
524,<|emo_fear|> im feeling so frantic that i want to eat something cool to try to keep me company
525,<|emo_fear|> It's too damn scary.
527,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] was on fire tonight
528,<|emo_fear|> i can feel my mind shift and my heart race with indecision
529,<|emo_fear|> The only cringe I've seen in this subreddit is when it comes to /r/kanye
531,<|emo_fear|> I’m scared for you
532,<|emo_fear|> i am so worried and scared about it all
533,<|emo_fear|> i woke up the next morning feeling pretty distressed
534,<|emo_fear|> i began to feel scared
535,<|emo_fear|> i did feel nervous so i said yoshiki
536,<|emo_fear|> I'm a horrible danger to myself
537,<|emo_fear|> ive always been afraid of feeling overwhelmed and confused by the amount and variety of things i have to learn in a day or so ive been taking it way more seriously
538,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very doubtful right now
540,<|emo_fear|> My favourite [NAME] looks worst here. Can’t imagine making her live in north america
541,<|emo_fear|> He’s creepy
542,"<|emo_fear|> A lot of the stuff she wears is awful, from her hair going down the back of her neck to her face."
543,<|emo_fear|> My mistake :(
544,<|emo_fear|> The creepiest possible person that lives in your head.
545,"<|emo_fear|> If it weren't for [NAME], [NAME] would have no career"
546,<|emo_fear|> i was sitting right next to my mom and felt so weird watching her walk over to her room to close the shutters and close the doors before leaving
547,"<|emo_fear|> oh, and now vini is down"
548,<|emo_fear|> How incredibly dangerous
549,<|emo_fear|> Yeah dude I know I should let the cat out but I'm really scared.
550,"<|emo_fear|> There's no telling what that guy may have been trying to accomplish, but the video does appear to show that he didn't succeed. "
551,<|emo_fear|> i see myself feeling suspicious of the other students and the adults around me
552,<|emo_fear|> i see someone on the internet that is so hateful but no matter what its just because i have done nothing wrong and can look out for others rather than myself
553,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] was also called a racist by the [NAME] people for his racist views before the [NAME] years. He changed his views after the [NAME] people started coming out. It could be said he's a racist too.
555,"<|emo_fear|> It never ceases to amaze me how many people don't know this, unfortunately some of them are probably very wellread and have the means to be."
556,<|emo_fear|> This is the story of how I became a horrible person
557,<|emo_fear|> i feel vulnerable because we ve been together for almost a year what happened over the summer is that it got quite messy
558,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure as she seems to be unsure as well
559,<|emo_fear|> That movie really scared me when I was a kid.
560,<|emo_fear|> the worst is working with dealerships
561,<|emo_fear|> A couple months ago I wouldn't be surprised seeing this as another nail in the coffin for the torb boy but it seems to be keeping him in the lineup and his overall impact as a player will only grow.
562,<|emo_fear|> It's so scary and frustrating
563,<|emo_fear|> This is nightmare fuel.
564,<|emo_fear|> i feel like a wimpy old lady im afraid to write back to the internet because i dont want to be called on my frailty
565,<|emo_fear|>  That’s so creepy!
566,<|emo_fear|> i was so very impressed at how much feeling i got from her
567,<|emo_fear|> i feel really weird
569,<|emo_fear|> im worried that im going to feel anxious again for sure this week
570,<|emo_fear|> i had a feeling i was gonna get paranoid but the truth was i am enjoying how peaceful it feels
571,"<|emo_fear|> I was afraid for that exact reason, I'm still a little unsure as to whether I want to keep or cut bait. It's a weird situation but I fear it could get worse :("
572,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel helpless at all
573,<|emo_fear|> i could feel myself having a shaky feeling
574,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling anxious about all of this and my own future
575,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling fairly uncertain but at the same time i understand my situation and i am hopeful
576,<|emo_fear|> I'm also scared.
577,<|emo_fear|> Oh my gosh. This woman who died also had a son who died. RIP
578,"<|emo_fear|> If you look at most of the cases that attracted media attention, it wasn't just the newsworthy but also the terrifying stories."
579,<|emo_fear|> i feel nervous about it
580,<|emo_fear|> That would be abused really bad.
581,<|emo_fear|> i have been feeling very anxious
582,<|emo_fear|> That's awful. I'm so sorry that your friend is hurting.
583,<|emo_fear|> i just feel scared to call them
584,<|emo_fear|> Damn [NAME]!
585,<|emo_fear|> The most scary game that can possibly happen to me at this age
586,<|emo_fear|> that was a horrible call
587,<|emo_fear|> This is scary as fuck.
588,<|emo_fear|> I’m afraid for y’all who think this will fail...
590,<|emo_fear|> im feeling anxious again
593,<|emo_fear|> i feel that you are very scared as you see all your friends come to look for you
594,<|emo_fear|> im feeling like im in a dream world which is so weird really
595,<|emo_fear|> Because [NAME] is a disgusting autist.
596,<|emo_fear|> i feel so insecure i had to come up with a new word to describe the feeling of being uncertain i think thats what i called it
598,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit vulnerable
599,<|emo_fear|> i feel skeptical that all my memories are as accurate as they were then
600,<|emo_fear|> i feel very scared to tell my family
601,<|emo_fear|> This is scary
602,<|emo_fear|> This. It was so horrifying. I can't imagine thinking those thoughts.
603,<|emo_fear|> i feel very insecure because even though i have a new device i feel like i m still a rookie
604,<|emo_fear|> i find that it feels to me as if im putting on a brave face and saying this but this is so true
605,<|emo_fear|> I was just in shock when they actually answered the door themselves..
606,"<|emo_fear|> I was worried it would be too dark because of the amount of fog, but so far it Looks pretty decent."
607,<|emo_fear|> im feeling really indecisive about what i should write about
608,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel paranoid
609,<|emo_fear|> i am more scared but feeling a bit more sure with myself now
610,<|emo_fear|> i feel really helpless as you see i dont know what i am going to do
611,<|emo_fear|> i hope the people of north carolina dont feel rushed to rush towards the edge of the church and attempt to cross the bridge
612,<|emo_fear|> i started to feel a bit anxious
613,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling vulnerable all the time i also did not know that he knew enough to be vulnerable
614,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling very unsure of the future
615,"<|emo_fear|> A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one."
616,<|emo_fear|> im feeling unsure about the directions im going in
617,<|emo_fear|> Oh stop IT
618,<|emo_fear|> i didnt feel as terrified as i had been at the start or afterwards and i wasnt entirely sure what the next step was
619,<|emo_fear|> i love that its not just one long story but takes place over two seasons which is always a big problem for me when it comes to period drama
620,<|emo_fear|> Just gotta wait for the right moment. This game is so incredibly frantic. It's so good to just make a move at the right time.
621,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant trusting
622,<|emo_fear|> i feel more vulnerable to anyone and more at risk for assault or becoming overwhelmed by our feelings
623,<|emo_fear|> i cant feel hesitant to share my life a href http www

630,<|emo_fear|> I'm terrified.
631,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im a dumb or ignorant person sometimes
632,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite nervous about how much power i feel im starting to wonder if im even speaking to the true god
633,<|emo_fear|> i know some of you are feeling very uncertain about the world and how you were sheltered from a lot of things in your life
634,<|emo_fear|> >I think she needs to get some help with her speech Im very sorry for your situation. Hopefully one day you can change your voice.
635,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little bit paranoid actually as i can feel the chill already and im not even sure it is coming
636,<|emo_fear|> Oh. My heart!
637,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit terrified of the future
638,<|emo_fear|> i think most of readers probably feel quite alarmed if they are not familiar with the term.
639,<|emo_fear|> This gave me goosebumps!
640,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little doubtful and discouraged while waiting
641,<|emo_fear|> i feel skeptical at the moment

653,<|emo_fear|> This made me shiver. That poor janitor.
654,<|emo_fear|> i would feel weird about having a boyfriend
655,<|emo_fear|> i still feel a bit skeptical of this report
657,<|emo_fear|> Oh she dead
658,<|emo_fear|> There is a special place in hell for these kind of people.
659,<|emo_fear|> I am afraid I might be off base. Should I ask for an explaination? Or just be quiet? I thought I understood my rights and was surprised they didn't appreciate that.
660,<|emo_fear|> i am afraid to have done so as i have been feeling quite apprehensive about how my life will be in a few years
661,<|emo_fear|> This looks like total garbage.
662,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling extremely agitated

664,<|emo_fear|> This is the creepiest I've ever seen.
665,<|emo_fear|> I'm scared for her life
666,<|emo_fear|> i was afraid of having to tell him about my problems and feeling extremely unloved and unlocable
667,<|emo_fear|> I'm sorry my friend down voted you just cause your friend wants to be your partner.
668,<|emo_fear|> i wouldnt like to be surprised and feel fearful
669,<|emo_fear|> Just imagine being scared of a black bear
670,"<|emo_fear|> "" 'Don't go near him' sounds terrible"""
671,<|emo_fear|> i feel very uncertain right now
672,<|emo_fear|> i feel kinda nervous about it because it never really got off the ground yet
673,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit apprehensive but excited to be on my way to the university to continue my MA in public health
674,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling unsure and indecisive not sure what i want to do
675,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] damn it
676,<|emo_fear|> The creepiest of all the terrariums I've tried.
677,<|emo_fear|> You just posted the same thing but with pictures of you smoking weed instead. Pretty shaky.
678,<|emo_fear|> i really feel fearful and paranoid
680,<|emo_fear|> What a horrifically optimistic and dangerousibility scale you use. wildly optimistic and dangerous.
681,<|emo_fear|> i still have to feel a bit fearful at times
682,<|emo_fear|> This is creepy and sad and even more reason to not go out there.
683,<|emo_fear|> i feel so agitated right now
684,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite terrified
685,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling kind of weird but i need a break so im going to work on re using this list as a reminder when i ever i feel indecisive
686,<|emo_fear|> i feel shaken up and sad
687,<|emo_fear|> i could feel the fear in the pit of my stomach
688,<|emo_fear|> i just can t put my finger on why i feel so helpless
689,<|emo_fear|> i feel suspicious of anyone not who i know
690,<|emo_fear|> Not happy.
691,<|emo_fear|> A lot of people are very afraid to speak out though. You can be sure of this...we know who killed Bong.
692,<|emo_fear|> of course it’s horrible
693,"<|emo_fear|> A girl? You see a girl? No, it's a man. I feel your pain."
694,<|emo_fear|> i have a feeling he was too trusting
695,"<|emo_fear|> I'm thinking we're actually wondering about the monster himself, rather than the effect he's having on the story."
696,<|emo_fear|> i can remember going into it and feeling scared because im not used to this sort of environment and i dont like it
697,<|emo_fear|> i feel this question can become easily overwhelmed
698,<|emo_fear|> This is terrifying
699,<|emo_fear|> > but this is reddit and therefore many people don't understand how bad it is.
700,<|emo_fear|> i feel very distraught and afraid at the same time
701,<|emo_fear|> Because it's a terrible idea.
702,<|emo_fear|> Not even sure why people are downvoting you for this.
703,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little bit of anxiety just sitting here wondering if im doing ok
704,<|emo_fear|> i think a few people feel confused when i put too many words in a sentence
705,<|emo_fear|> What a bummer and a shame that this video maker and many other video game players are unable to understand this or are willing to excuse it.
706,<|emo_fear|> Because he's afraid people might find out about his pedophile past.
707,<|emo_fear|> This is scary!
708,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel scared
709,<|emo_fear|> im feeling quite unsure about
710,<|emo_fear|> I feel the same way. Sadly the only way to fix it is through a criminal justice system that criminalizes mental illness
711,<|emo_fear|> i was not feeling fearful
712,<|emo_fear|> i feel skeptical after reading all of this
713,<|emo_fear|> i feel somewhat terrified
715,<|emo_fear|> This is what I'm afraid of as a [NAME] [NAME] :D
717,<|emo_fear|> i got home and it woke me up feeling terrified of what i had done
718,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling quite paranoid at this point
719,<|emo_fear|> Oh [NAME] I knew something was wrong when the “rookies” all started to clap
720,<|emo_fear|> He went on to say that he and his wife lived in a quiet part of town where it was harder to find trouble than in many parts of the country
721,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared insecure and doubtful
722,<|emo_fear|> It’s so terrifying!
723,<|emo_fear|> I'm scared that someone will be able to make sure it's you in real life.
724,<|emo_fear|> i didnt feel fearful or anything
725,<|emo_fear|> The only horror im scared to find a copy of
726,<|emo_fear|> im feeling scared for you
727,<|emo_fear|> We are still a long way from a society of zero tolerance for sexual assault and harassment. What a nightmare we live in
728,<|emo_fear|> It’s creepy.
729,<|emo_fear|> He was scared for his life....
730,<|emo_fear|> i feel nervous
731,<|emo_fear|> im feeling paranoid
732,<|emo_fear|> Who the hell thought it could go this wrong
733,<|emo_fear|> i did feel very helpless to do anything about the situation
734,<|emo_fear|> i remember feeling terrified because we were about to get downvoted by a reddit sub from seoul
735,"<|emo_fear|> The only thing keeping me warm in that sub zero temperature is the stupidity, fear and self-loathing I feel for the alphas on Reddit who play it straight and can't see the problem."
736,<|emo_fear|> i feel less shy about what i am writing
737,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little fearful that we arent really doing anything important right now
738,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless and helpless and yet i feel wonderful
739,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel afraid
740,<|emo_fear|> I'm scared.
741,<|emo_fear|> i could just be passive aggressive in doing it if youre feeling threatened or uncomfortable somewhere
742,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit insecure about my writing at the moment
743,<|emo_fear|> i feel anxious all the time because i know im not gonna make it through another week with two days off
744,<|emo_fear|> i started feeling very shaky
745,<|emo_fear|> i feel as though i have a lot to learn how i have accepted the possibility that life had gone to pieces
746,"<|emo_fear|> of course, since they all seem to have the exact same problem with names (?)"
747,<|emo_fear|> i came to the realization that it was not the case that i could somehow stop feeling like an awful person because of my physical environment
748,"<|emo_fear|> This is terrible, but is there any way to turn off the autocorrect on in the comment?"
749,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling quite apprehensive
750,<|emo_fear|> i have to read a word everytime i reentries the field now
751,<|emo_fear|> i feel uncertain and sad
753,<|emo_fear|> That's even scarier. One of our kids has a very rare skin cancer and it's directly tied to his skin color.
754,"<|emo_fear|> [NAME] looks like he's going to the basket when the shot clock hits 20 seconds. That would be a terrible thing to do, literally."
755,<|emo_fear|> That’s terrible... Very scary.
756,<|emo_fear|> i still feel a little bit hesitant
757,<|emo_fear|> i feel very hesitant about using the word innocent
758,<|emo_fear|> i did not feel apprehensive
759,<|emo_fear|> I'm not the only one [NAME] who feels intimidated by [NAME] but I'm about the only one willing to put up with his crap behavior.
760,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared too
761,<|emo_fear|> Soooooo yes!
762,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel pressured to make them feel uncomfortable
763,<|emo_fear|> And I'm crying.
764,<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid to Tell You My fears are more real than you realise
765,<|emo_fear|> Ooh I’m seeing something I can't quite put my finger on.
766,"<|emo_fear|> I was like ""man, this is gonna get awkward"" *eyeroll*"
767,<|emo_fear|> It's a terrible thing to do.
768,<|emo_fear|> i feel like the most doubtful person on the planet right now
769,<|emo_fear|> i feel very frightened of the future
770,<|emo_fear|> What's the cringe?
771,<|emo_fear|> i didnt feel terrified about the whole thing
772,<|emo_fear|> i love you
773,<|emo_fear|> oh ok it did
774,<|emo_fear|> I am a little scared to read about [NAME] being arrested...
776,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] just might be the most useless Of any politician And not even a remotely Leftist politicians.
777,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling hesitant on opening up my feelings to the world of the stranger
778,<|emo_fear|> So creepy. Made me check my locks.
779,<|emo_fear|> i can say that it was very emotional for me and i feel shaken up about it
780,<|emo_fear|> i have a feeling he is afraid of what he saw in his vision
781,<|emo_fear|> i feel very apprehensive about having to return the first one to your place of worship
782,<|emo_fear|> i remember feeling surprised and disappointed that we didn t have a full lineup
783,<|emo_fear|> > They have no idea what I hear I try to imagine what it is like to be so repulsively horrible that your parents let him
784,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] is creepy
785,"<|emo_fear|> In the words of [NAME], [NAME] has 'gone down the drain' thanks to public indecency laws. "
786,<|emo_fear|> i felt as if i was so frightened
787,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling very uncertain about how we were going to go about the plan
788,<|emo_fear|> i just felt very vulnerable to someone like that without thinking she was worse than that
789,<|emo_fear|> They think that if a law is passed that it cannot be overturned.
790,<|emo_fear|> im feeling apprehensive about it
791,"<|emo_fear|> I am not afraid of dying, if only to live my last moments with dignity and honor"
792,<|emo_fear|> I would be scared for fran
793,<|emo_fear|> i feel paranoid whenever i go in there to take pictures
794,<|emo_fear|> What a terrible list
795,<|emo_fear|> i can t do anything but feel helpless and afraid and totally useless at the same time
796,<|emo_fear|> Who the hell thought he was dead
797,<|emo_fear|> i feel weird and want to stay home but it s just not worth the trouble
799,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little paranoid with my mother right now
800,<|emo_fear|> You're a horrible human being.
802,<|emo_fear|> i feel like i m being a bit paranoid and self medicating to keep my mouth shut
803,<|emo_fear|> i feel so unsure about it
805,<|emo_fear|> im feeling terrified because my dad looks like he wants me to feel terrified and tells me that im not scared
806,<|emo_fear|> That sounds awful. Did you somehow video store it or something? I'm sure you're capable of better due diligence.
807,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit insecure especially because i dont know exactly where but somehow i know there may be some things that i willnt be able to do and maybe even something that i wont be able to do at all and somehow im not sure if that could be faulted or expected
808,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im in the wrong body and would probably never want to leave it but for the chance to know more about it
809,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless and in control but just like we could fight this and it could hurt just like that with us and it could give into the craving we feel for food
810,<|emo_fear|> There’s something seriously wrong when a [NAME] fan comes into your life.
811,<|emo_fear|> I'm scared I don't have a key.
812,<|emo_fear|> im feeling skeptical about it
813,<|emo_fear|> i want to find out how i feel but i cant ask in fear
815,<|emo_fear|> im sorry human being makes things worse for me
816,<|emo_fear|> i am not feeling scared for this reason alone
817,<|emo_fear|> i find myself feeling anxious often with his presence
818,<|emo_fear|> i have two fairly young children who each want to play different kinds of games with me as well a daughter who has just completed her first year of primary school the girls each do feel very unsure of themselves
819,<|emo_fear|> i got into a situation where i was feeling anxious
820,<|emo_fear|> They have no sense of community either. What a trainwreck
821,<|emo_fear|> i still feel like im some awkward virgin virgin even though i was actually single for a few years lol
822,<|emo_fear|> That was so painful.
823,<|emo_fear|> I'm so worried that [NAME] will turn into [NAME] in the next movie...
824,<|emo_fear|> This has been reposted many times over the last week and it honestly makes me really angry that people still fall victims to those sites.
825,<|emo_fear|> I’m a terrible person because of this
826,<|emo_fear|> i started feeling more intimidated and confused
827,<|emo_fear|> im feeling shy of me
828,<|emo_fear|> i feel that im vulnerable because of my feelings i can never know what is real love
829,<|emo_fear|> i feel terrified for him
830,<|emo_fear|> The fact that they continue to push them despite these horrific health problems is utterly horrifying.
831,<|emo_fear|> Because the false accusation makes my anxiety worse
832,<|emo_fear|> The thing I love about [NAME] is how much he and his family have to sacrifice for him. Very heartbreaking.
833,"<|emo_fear|> No, but she probably noticed you looking too. In other words, there are rules of engagement for these situations, but for this she was under NO circumstances breaking them."
834,"<|emo_fear|> i could feel my breath coming in shaky puffs, im sure it was not very pleasant"
835,<|emo_fear|> We are losing badly on purpose
836,"<|emo_fear|> [NAME], stop."
837,"<|emo_fear|> Yeah, the company is bad. Its logo is a complete mess, too. "
838,<|emo_fear|> Yeah she should probably go ahead and get herself a driver's license.
839,<|emo_fear|> i feel uncertain about everything and that scares me
840,<|emo_fear|> i feel so insecure about his life
841,<|emo_fear|> No. Just no.
842,<|emo_fear|> He's a creepy old hag
843,<|emo_fear|> It is weird that he's single.
844,"<|emo_fear|> This is so scary to know that people with Asperger's can't process social stressors properly, it seems like an almost daily occurrence. "
845,<|emo_fear|> They didn’t back down and now they’re fighting back
846,<|emo_fear|> i can never leave feeling helpless
847,<|emo_fear|> i can hear the thoughts and feelings of a lot of the young girls i know but i really dont know how i feel im just afraid
848,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling apprehensive
849,<|emo_fear|> i feel tortured and alone
850,<|emo_fear|> i also feel vulnerable
851,<|emo_fear|> Not having an answer for that is unfortunate :/
852,<|emo_fear|> i really feel afraid to lose again
853,<|emo_fear|> i feel more doubtful
854,<|emo_fear|> im feeling more and more uncomfortable as the day goes on
855,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling a little unsure if i am the right person for the job
856,<|emo_fear|> i feel paranoid because i don t even know what happened today and tomorrow
858,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling a bit overwhelmed
859,<|emo_fear|> i had a very bad feeling that my life was in danger but i was also aware of the fact that it was extremely dangerous and that i was under great stress and that what i was going to do was absolutely critical
860,<|emo_fear|> im feeling so helpless now
861,<|emo_fear|> I feel threatened and anxious and sad on a daily basis
862,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little bit intimidated to try out some new products without even trying them out until now
863,<|emo_fear|> This is the exact fear I had
864,<|emo_fear|> i feel very apprehensive about it
865,<|emo_fear|> i still feel quite scared
866,<|emo_fear|> That’s frightening
867,<|emo_fear|> i often feel terrified to be in others eyes and yet i love them
868,"<|emo_fear|> This game is over. The only thing that will save this world is your actions. Don't play this game, or else you'll die."
869,<|emo_fear|> i feel like i can take a shower and im in for a really terrifying night if i go this route
870,<|emo_fear|> i do feel very nervous but if my doctor gives me some breathing support right now and also tells me i can come back at any time i won t be too concerned let us worry about myself and
871,<|emo_fear|> The weirdest part is saying her story is almost exactly the same as mine. Pretty terrifying.
872,<|emo_fear|> i had been feeling afraid of the strange emotions that were often associated with the cryptanalysis of the cryptogram
873,<|emo_fear|> im on a date with someone and both are drunk so both of them start talking about weird stuff then i get nervous when i find out why
874,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling pretty depressed lately and i just hate feeling like this
875,<|emo_fear|> im feeling pretty terrified of how much i have to drink and everything
876,<|emo_fear|> i was told that i was feeling a little shy
877,<|emo_fear|> i feel very insecure and guilty
878,<|emo_fear|> i didnt feel anxious
879,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very fearful for things
880,<|emo_fear|> i feel weird because i did have a feeling i would do alright
881,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite shocked that we had a chief justice or a justice so clearly not sympathetic towards me and the black community
882,<|emo_fear|> i feel uncertain about
883,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very doubtful about the whole thing
884,<|emo_fear|> The only worse thing about this is: It was an offhand comment from a random stranger.
885,<|emo_fear|> i feel less shy of your little one
886,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to give in to a nagging fear that im doing something wrong now
887,"<|emo_fear|> Damn it, my dad!"
888,<|emo_fear|> I thought it was funny until the head shot came out.
889,<|emo_fear|> i do feel a bit hesitant to say anything about what it is like to be a mother and why it is the perfect fit but it s not my fault either
890,<|emo_fear|> What a cataclysm
891,"<|emo_fear|> A woman with multiple sclerosis needs supportive living. Not a lot, but more than that."
892,<|emo_fear|> I had to shut my mouth right there
893,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite scared
894,<|emo_fear|> The fact that we elected this goon shows how out of touch you have gotten.
895,"<|emo_fear|> Oh yeah, and the giant water spout on the top right of the photo is mine too"
896,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure and not anxious yet i feel confident
897,<|emo_fear|> i dont really feel any fear or anxiety when im out but im not 100% sure what i am expecting to happen for a number of days
898,<|emo_fear|> > But they are *so* expensive it's ludicrous. What a joke
899,<|emo_fear|> im feeling apprehensive about a lot of things i wish to try that make an impression but im not sure what its worth to go through
900,<|emo_fear|> It is weird to see [NAME] as [NAME] and not [NAME] in op.
901,<|emo_fear|> I’m scared to look
902,<|emo_fear|> Omg its hannibal cooper
903,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] did us wrong when we signed him as an add on. I wouldnt be too upset with him if he leaves now for nothing
904,<|emo_fear|> How scary. I hope he was alright.
905,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling a little apprehensive and doubtful
906,<|emo_fear|> i could feel myself getting shaky and just generally feeling a little weird
907,<|emo_fear|> i hate feeling alone
908,<|emo_fear|> i feel extremely nervous about it
909,<|emo_fear|> i started to feel paranoid if i didnt know about the matter
910,"<|emo_fear|> Oh, those dreadful things. My cat got them from a pet store years ago. She's a big cat lady now."
911,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little uncertain about it all
912,<|emo_fear|> i have a number of feelings that if i had been around longer i may have had them now
913,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to share my feelings because i have a feeling that my fears are completely justified
914,<|emo_fear|> My worst fear is that he'll turn out to be my best friend
915,<|emo_fear|> I'm scared for my life
917,<|emo_fear|> Oh my [NAME] how awful
918,<|emo_fear|> They’re either scared of the workers or the products
919,<|emo_fear|> i feel a weird sense of foreboding
920,<|emo_fear|> This is so scary. I loved [NAME] but this scared me so much.
921,<|emo_fear|> What a miserable crier.
922,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid to open my mouth
923,<|emo_fear|> i feel like its a little ridiculous
924,<|emo_fear|> And don't forget the ridiculous icing job on purpose?? BOOO YEAH!!!
925,"<|emo_fear|> You mean like the movie *Shallow Hal?*. I thought it was terrible, but it turns out it was actually pretty good."
926,<|emo_fear|> Yeah it did
927,"<|emo_fear|> Lol, I'm 5'11"" and about 155 lbs. I'm a pretty solid workout for the job."
928,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] is a bitch
929,<|emo_fear|> im left feeling a little shaken up but with the time running out now rather than feeling distraught over it
930,<|emo_fear|> i feel completely scared that im going to feel like this forever
931,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little reluctant to go up there
932,<|emo_fear|> I'm actually scared to be honest with [NAME]. It would be horrible for both of us.
933,<|emo_fear|> I’m so scared to call my mom 🤦🏻‍♀️ :(
934,<|emo_fear|> I do believe there was a shooting range called 'Theaters' in the old town where we played. If anyone has any footage from there please share.
936,<|emo_fear|> i feel so nervous
937,<|emo_fear|> i had just been hit by a car and it was a close race so i didn t have much time to think before i d heard that my friend had been seriously hurt badly
938,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless in my own mind
939,<|emo_fear|> They’re scared
940,<|emo_fear|> i can feel the heart of you moving so i am afraid this will feel like a last ditch effort
941,<|emo_fear|> i dont have a strong feeling on the matter right now and it seems doubtful for me to get agitated until i hear this from him on a personal level what do i do if he doesnt reply
942,<|emo_fear|> i see that i tend to look so embarrassed and doubtful and awkward and i feel more than a bit ashamed about the people around me the people i feel insecure about my feelings and the people around me
943,<|emo_fear|> The only bad thing about this is that he actually seems like a decent guy. I have no idea what to do to him.
944,<|emo_fear|> This is disturbing.
945,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling uncertain and disoriented
946,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling very scared afraid
947,<|emo_fear|> This hurts to watch
949,<|emo_fear|> How is this horrifying
950,<|emo_fear|> It's hard to look away when you're under these horrible lights.
951,<|emo_fear|> It does not. This is a terrible ad.
952,<|emo_fear|> i feel as if i am really scared to get off the plane
953,<|emo_fear|> when we went to buy food for the guests which was in a small area which we were afraid we would be blocked
954,<|emo_fear|> This kid is so afraid of losing to slip up like that. At least it’s not a serious injury.
955,<|emo_fear|> i feel terrified as i look at these
956,<|emo_fear|> I just want to die
957,<|emo_fear|> It was weird how much I liked it...
958,<|emo_fear|> i feel so scared but i don t know how i am going to do that when they ask me to swear at them in front of all the others
959,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling very overwhelmed and underappreciated all the time
960,<|emo_fear|> And [NAME] is worse
961,<|emo_fear|> Oh no oh no no
962,"<|emo_fear|> >[NAME] I cannot imagine there is anyone as appalled by the term ""cuckold"" as I am. Cuckolds, being pedophiles."
963,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im a weirdo like im a kid but im scared of the world
964,<|emo_fear|> i feel about being terrified
965,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure as to where i was
966,<|emo_fear|> What a horrible list
967,"<|emo_fear|> Damn, that's some weed I've never seen before"
968,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] wept.
969,<|emo_fear|> This is a good point but I think it could be better. What I mean is more recently created languages are often highly literate while still being relatively new.
970,<|emo_fear|> I'm a woman but I'm also afraid I'm going to get rape flashbacks
971,<|emo_fear|> I'd be creeped out.
972,<|emo_fear|> Holy shit
973,<|emo_fear|> i still feel vulnerable emotionally and socially
974,<|emo_fear|> i have a feeling i will be feeling apprehensive once im back in im own home with no one coming from out of state
975,<|emo_fear|> The guy in the white hat with the glasses looks terrified
976,<|emo_fear|> She’s horrible
977,<|emo_fear|> ive never heard of being made to feel guilty for being innocent and its frightening
978,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit intimidated to approach them
979,"<|emo_fear|> That’s not even a creepy nightmare, that’s just a picture of him with his gun drawn and half-naked."
980,<|emo_fear|> I'll give you that. It was a flop and it still is a terrible thing to do.
981,<|emo_fear|> Soooo [NAME] was on another level then.
982,<|emo_fear|> Yeah I would've had a panic attack if [NAME] had told me. Damnit
983,<|emo_fear|> i feel anxious and wonder if i have the guts or the time to write a poem
984,"<|emo_fear|> When she was found guilty, it was almost unbelievable. It was also disgusting - a combination of circumstances, from a law enforcement perspective."
985,<|emo_fear|> Your age difference is extremely creepy and creepy things have happened to you before. Get out now.
986,<|emo_fear|> I thought he was a moron but I was really hoping this was a moron but I guess not.
987,<|emo_fear|> i feel very unsure of when to start teaching again
988,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] was playing awful tonight and honestly I really don’t like any starting point guard because [NAME] is so inconsistent.
990,"<|emo_fear|> The first is creepy, the second is sad. The third one is uncertain... kinda scary "
991,<|emo_fear|> i feel slightly skeptical im sure there is much more to this story but ill just stick with what im seeing and do my best to check this out
992,<|emo_fear|> i didnt feel overwhelmed by my questions

1003,<|emo_fear|> i feel shaken up by the news about him
1004,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little bit apprehensive with the whole project now
1005,"<|emo_fear|> [NAME] said he wanted to ""burn it all the time"" which is kinda cringe"
1006,<|emo_fear|> i was still more afraid for myself than something else
1007,<|emo_fear|> I'm worried my daughter and I will get obese because of this.
1008,"<|emo_fear|> Ah, those dreadful things. I gave those away."
1009,<|emo_fear|> i feel the most hesitant i m terrified of not being able to leave that place
1010,"<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid that I'll get it from here, after all this trouble making them stop. You're my best friend in the whole world, bud! "
1011,"<|emo_fear|> I would say they are scared for his life. They've done nothing wrong, he is a very bright human being who many of us could learn a lot from. That is a very scary thing to think about"
1012,<|emo_fear|> i feel somewhat terrified and quite uncomfortable with where i am at in the game right now
1013,<|emo_fear|> i feel pretty afraid to tell people about it because i dont want them to ever be part of my life
1015,<|emo_fear|> Oh hell yeah
1016,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel so agitated and nervous over this
1017,<|emo_fear|> I’m not scared. I’m excited
1018,<|emo_fear|> of a man dying of dysentery due to fear of plague
1019,<|emo_fear|> i have no idea what is going on in my brain
1020,<|emo_fear|> i feel nervous but im not saying it wont happen
1021,<|emo_fear|> This person should be outed to the world. [NAME] do you really want this guy alive?
1022,<|emo_fear|> i start to feel doubtful
1023,<|emo_fear|> The horror!
1024,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling paranoid
1025,<|emo_fear|> I'm still wondering what happened after the apparent phone call. Did she panic or something?
1026,"<|emo_fear|> Oh look, it's the same kid who wrote the song about [NAME] being stoned that made us choose sides."
1027,<|emo_fear|> Oh my god.... the awkward situations you go to.
1028,<|emo_fear|> i remember the first time i was feeling insecure and self conscious about being in my 40s
1029,<|emo_fear|> i feel doubtful of everything and yet terrified of happening
1030,<|emo_fear|> I feel so horrible. What was I thinking? I'm so sorry.
1031,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little reluctant to put it on here but ill do that
1032,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling nervous but determined
1033,"<|emo_fear|> The fact that a person has a gun probably means they are dangerous. If they can shoot, how come you can't?"
1034,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] was terrible this year for one reason alone. All his playoff starts were within 2nd half minutes and he did not record a single PP for at least 16 minutes
1035,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little bit overwhelmed
1036,<|emo_fear|> im feeling fairly anxious but just know that i am doing good and im doing my best to keep it up
1037,<|emo_fear|> i know it is hard to do but when i feel afraid they will come
1038,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to put anything forward because it s like the whole world is afraid to let itself say anything in which there really is anything to say
1039,<|emo_fear|> i feel really stressed out and overwhelmed
1040,"<|emo_fear|> ""Fuck no I'll kill them all"" *yelled as if to a pack of hyenas*"
1041,<|emo_fear|> i feel pretty insecure in that because i was so young
1042,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little worried she might have been getting the wrong kind of drug
1043,<|emo_fear|> You have no idea how many people were devastated by 9/11
1044,<|emo_fear|> im feeling weird because ive been sitting at home reading every word i have on the internet and its become this little journal and just kind of like a journal at its core
1045,<|emo_fear|> i have tried doing this in an office setting but there were some uncomfortable moments
1046,<|emo_fear|> My [NAME] woke up onisember of 2018 like 2019 and hasn’t responded to email messages for nearly two years
1047,"<|emo_fear|> Just gonna be super mean here, as a current [NAME] [NAME] this made me cringe into smithereens"
1048,<|emo_fear|> i feel skeptical and doubtful
1049,<|emo_fear|> i feel doubtful of myself and i dont know why
1050,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little afraid to approach him
1051,<|emo_fear|> i couldnt help but feel nervous as i did this
1052,<|emo_fear|> i feel very helpless right now
1053,<|emo_fear|> i feel terrified and overwhelmed
1054,<|emo_fear|> Omg that's too many pills
1055,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im a bit ridiculous for saying that as im so new to the scene haha
1056,<|emo_fear|> Not to be alarmist but these sort of events happening more and more.
1057,<|emo_fear|> He was so intent on hitting [NAME] with the home run that he essentially gave up the throw. So he's lucky he didn't get anyTHING else.
1058,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little hesitant or unsure of myself when im feeling unsure of myself
1059,<|emo_fear|> They are the worst because their only goal is to bully and make a person afraid of them
1060,<|emo_fear|> i love this place but lately i feel as if im a strange one
1062,<|emo_fear|> i do feel overwhelmed by life
1064,<|emo_fear|> i feel nervous and uncertain
1065,<|emo_fear|> i could feel what was a little hesitant maybe nervous
1066,"<|emo_fear|> ""Lebron King's back"" ""Rise of Agon"""
1067,<|emo_fear|> This kind of thing happened to me at a friend's house. I'm very afraid for my own safety.
1068,<|emo_fear|> i cant help feeling afraid about how much the world is losing the plot
1069,<|emo_fear|> Just terrible.
1070,<|emo_fear|> im feeling quite apprehensive about it
1071,"<|emo_fear|> The fact that you can't see the redzone interception is telling. I'm sure [NAME] was pressured, but it was caught?"
1072,<|emo_fear|> This is so scary. I'm a 40 y/o male and this is how much I want to kill myself.
1073,<|emo_fear|> I’m scared that I’m going to mess up. Can’t wait to try this thing out.
1074,<|emo_fear|> Ahhh. My heart!
1075,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling a little less fearful about going into this week
1076,<|emo_fear|> It's worse. Some babies are so small and delicate. They might suffocate. Some babies are just so ugly. It really saddens me.
1077,<|emo_fear|> i feel more insecure and awkward around girls who have more money than i do
1078,<|emo_fear|> when i was three years old and we were getting ready for school
1079,<|emo_fear|> I'm thinking he was abused by his father.
1080,<|emo_fear|> i feel more than a little bit intimidated by the whole thing
1081,<|emo_fear|> That’s awful. :(
1082,<|emo_fear|> Oh you are horrible
1083,<|emo_fear|> How very scary. The only thing they've got to worry about is themselves.
1084,"<|emo_fear|> As a Ducks fan, this thread makes me sad. Sad... "
1085,<|emo_fear|> ive been reading and feeling a little weird about this so it s worth sharing
1086,<|emo_fear|> im starting to feel quite scared for my life
1087,"<|emo_fear|> Ahhh, because you are not a real american! Your media is fake news, stop spreading it!"
1088,<|emo_fear|> i had to find a way to tell my mother how i felt and this frightened her
1089,<|emo_fear|> i began to feel nervous
1090,"<|emo_fear|> This is scary, like I said, like I said, like I said, like I said, like I said, like I said"
1091,<|emo_fear|> i must admit that i may be nervous but is it any doubt that a week of nothing of this could change the course of my life and the way i will go about my life? this week alone will make a difference
1092,"<|emo_fear|> Who the hell thought he was dead, seriously."
1093,<|emo_fear|> i feel skeptical that all the important links and information in this report actually exist
1094,<|emo_fear|> i feel very helpless and undermanned
1095,<|emo_fear|> i feel kind of stupid now for trusting you
1096,<|emo_fear|> i feel terrified of the future
1097,<|emo_fear|> im feeling vulnerable and insecure
1098,<|emo_fear|> i feel terrified
1100,<|emo_fear|> I feel like I got sucked into a giant squid tank with all my brain.
1101,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant to get any further into it because there is still so much we know that will not change and it would ruin the whole thing
1102,<|emo_fear|> i remember feeling extremely nervous
1103,<|emo_fear|> What a horrifying post omg
1104,<|emo_fear|> i still feel like a year old im also scared out there
1105,<|emo_fear|> I can see how that would be horrifying. People in the states are less likely to report any concerns.
1106,<|emo_fear|> This is creepy how much I love Reddit in general and here in theWA community. These witch hunts are getting posted way out there.
1107,"<|emo_fear|> [NAME] is a horrible, horrible defender. I wish he would go to OKC."
1109,<|emo_fear|> That monster!
1110,<|emo_fear|> i feel very unsure about the future and

1112,<|emo_fear|> i feel uncertain and out there
1113,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared if i wouldnt have written those words
1114,"<|emo_fear|> Yeah, she's also incredibly beautiful"
1115,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite reluctant to go outside but it s entirely possible even if i am afraid of having a heart attack
1116,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling fearful now
1117,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid and nervous because now i feel shes going to see me as a threats
1118,<|emo_fear|> i did not feel afraid
1119,<|emo_fear|> im feeling restless
1120,<|emo_fear|> The way I dress whenever I'm with my friends and it always makes them all stare at me.
1121,<|emo_fear|> i should be hesitant about writing about these kinds of things but i feel terrified to
1122,<|emo_fear|> i cannot really express to you how frightened i feel for me because i am scared of what will happen to me
1123,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little uncertain about the future of scifi and movies
1124,<|emo_fear|> oh is that it
1125,<|emo_fear|> The last time [NAME] was in here it was for a little while and people were making fun of people commenting on posts he didn't show up. Stay safe [NAME] :)
1126,<|emo_fear|> They’re disgusting people inside and out
1127,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared when im around people who do anything remotely dangerous
1128,<|emo_fear|> i don t have a reason to think that i m doing anything that dangerous because i have no reason to feel afraid
1129,<|emo_fear|> I feel like this movie is being bombarded with too much ‘politics’
1130,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little scared about my words
1131,"<|emo_fear|> Well, from experience I know that fear of missing out is more of build up than actual worry."
1132,<|emo_fear|> I was thinking something similar but worry is also common.
1133,<|emo_fear|> i can t be sure but i feel a little hesitant about trusting him
1134,<|emo_fear|> i would like to say that this was an easy decision but its still a feeling of helpless
1135,<|emo_fear|> I'm shocked he doesn't already have one
1136,<|emo_fear|> I'm more than double what I said and I've been with three! What a nightmare life we've lived.
1137,<|emo_fear|> Omg i have to die
1138,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling very doubtful of myself
1139,<|emo_fear|> Oh gosh he's in pain
1140,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling pretty anxious
1141,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling a bit skeptical for a few days
1142,<|emo_fear|> i think it is a vital factor in why the people who are afraid of saying no are scared of speaking up
1143,<|emo_fear|> i went to bed feeling very anxious
1144,<|emo_fear|> i feel like a weird freak
1145,"<|emo_fear|> That’s one way to say ""I don’t care anymore"""
1146,<|emo_fear|> i feel anxious i eat
1147,<|emo_fear|> I've never cringed so hard
1148,<|emo_fear|> im also feeling less fearful of the world and more determined to learn and grow in the face of new and different terrains
1150,<|emo_fear|> Oh [NAME] [NAME] no i didn't say that
1151,<|emo_fear|> This is just a horrible mix of too much cough syrup and too little alcohol. I can't imagine drinking any mix of those things together.
1152,<|emo_fear|> I feel assaulted
1153,<|emo_fear|> That was the worst possible outcome
1154,<|emo_fear|> i feel anxious and out of control all the time
1155,<|emo_fear|> i feel apprehensive about the event
1156,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared to be a girl

1160,<|emo_fear|> i started to feel anxious
1161,<|emo_fear|> i think i feel a little apprehensive about it
1162,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] the nastiest!!
1163,<|emo_fear|> i have to admit i am feeling apprehensive a little bit scared and worried
1165,"<|emo_fear|> This is almost as scary as not getting vaccinated, I think."
1166,<|emo_fear|> i can feel frantic
1167,<|emo_fear|> I think it could be a horrible thing to do. It could make a person's anxiety worse.
1168,<|emo_fear|> Omg i’ve had sleep paralysis once and it’s really bad
1169,<|emo_fear|> im still feeling a little shaken up
1170,<|emo_fear|> i thought that i was going to say something about the things i was feeling which would make me seem a little awkward
1171,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling insecure
1172,<|emo_fear|> i feel frightened just reading this
1173,<|emo_fear|> i thought about having the surgery but did not feel as terrified at seeing as i did when i saw the scars to my leg and armpit during my summer holidays as well as one over my left eye
1174,<|emo_fear|> i feel kind of vulnerable because this is my first place i know something is wrong
1175,<|emo_fear|> This was painful
1176,<|emo_fear|> He is horrible
1177,<|emo_fear|> i would leave feeling very doubtful about the future of my health care
1178,<|emo_fear|> I don't think that's much of a problem for most people here. Just be aware of how others talk and act.
1179,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared a href http imafowler
1180,<|emo_fear|> i feel paranoid all the time
1181,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling hesitant about it
1182,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling restless
1183,<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid you're completely correct. He knew nothing of what was happening and didn't do anything to stop it.
1184,<|emo_fear|> My fear is *not* that he will actually lose Florida.
1185,<|emo_fear|> i feel confused
1186,<|emo_fear|> Your wife is a horrible person.
1188,"<|emo_fear|> [NAME] is not shy about sharing his emotions on the ice, it’s scary to think how much stronger [NAME] could take a hit like that"

1194,"<|emo_fear|> He's not, I'm afraid."
1195,<|emo_fear|> I’m seeing a lot of [NAME] here lately though. Looks like he’s doing everything possible to cause trouble for [NAME] while also helping his brother. Not a good mix.
1196,<|emo_fear|> I can see the dread now
1197,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] is a cancer in our cancerous society.
1198,<|emo_fear|> This is so scary and so very sad. Eleven??? A baby! I was still building forts forts. She took a live one!!!!

1217,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little too eager to write
1218,<|emo_fear|> i feel so reluctant to talk to anyone else about this
1219,<|emo_fear|> i just feel less shy around them

1221,<|emo_fear|> I miss that show...

1240,<|emo_fear|> i feel nervous about it all
1241,<|emo_fear|> i feel this strange sense of burden on my shoulders
1242,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit apprehensive and half expecting nightmare result
1243,<|emo_fear|> i feel anxious or overwhelmed or something else a lot when you have an entire room full of books close by and you have to call off your holiday party at your local library because you are all sitting around all waiting for an answer to make one
1244,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im on shaky feet more than the others
1245,"<|emo_fear|> I've been there. It's not the worst, but honestly it was worse."

1258,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless and out of control at the same time
1259,<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid your fear is probably justified.
1260,<|emo_fear|> i feel so uncertain and helpless to protect others and myself
1261,<|emo_fear|> oh [NAME] that's horrible

1269,<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid it's not.
1270,"<|emo_fear|> A lot of women are afraid to tell their stories because they're scared of what will happen to them or worse, end up in abusive relationships. "
1271,<|emo_fear|> i also feel afraid that the media might lose interest in the case
1272,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling less vulnerable to attacks from different quarters especially since we are all aware of the negative affects that have played themselves out on a much smaller scale than some more senior officials of the government
1273,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] was the worst Of any sports team Unis!!!
1274,<|emo_fear|> i feel really frightened now but i can t help it
1275,<|emo_fear|> And so is your boyfriend. He too hates how much he feels threatened by you.
1276,<|emo_fear|> i feel insecure and anxious about my job as a doctor
1277,<|emo_fear|> She's almost exactly like my ex. I find her creepy and depressed way more than her looks.
1278,<|emo_fear|> My son told a group of teachers that [NAME]. Really scary. Theater class had a lot of awkwardness and it scared them.

1291,<|emo_fear|> i could feel the frantic pace and he was never too far behind me or there was nothing to stop me from pushing on
1292,<|emo_fear|> I can’t tell if paranoid delusions or just overall anxiety relate to them. I’ve tried and both have worked.
1293,<|emo_fear|> i feel that i know less about them more about my feelings and how they affected me
1294,<|emo_fear|> I've heard of horrifying things. This is just an educated scare. Stay away from any of the tourist areas.

1307,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] is a very dangerous man. Have he been called before by the police?
1308,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel anxious
1309,<|emo_fear|> I just can't. :(
1310,<|emo_fear|> That is awful. Is there any way we could try to put a stop to that?
1311,"<|emo_fear|> Oh my gosh they actually tried that! I mean yes it was horrible, but it did work"
1312,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to try anything new because in my mind i am convinced the world will tell me to cool it
1313,<|emo_fear|> im feeling apprehensive and nervous as we go
1314,"<|emo_fear|> When I say I love you, you're saying I hate you ☹️"
1315,<|emo_fear|> im trying to say something because im feeling a little scared and worried about things
1316,<|emo_fear|> i feel tortured by the guilt that is all that i feel
1317,"<|emo_fear|> I'm so worried that [NAME] will wind up in the D-League, he's been so inconsistent this year "
1318,"<|emo_fear|> Omg, the face"
1319,<|emo_fear|> What a fucking idiotic thing to say.
1320,<|emo_fear|> i feel so helpless and useless here now
1321,<|emo_fear|> i still feel hesitant to get into the subject matter
1322,<|emo_fear|> That's awful. [NAME] is really lucky to be alive.
1323,<|emo_fear|> A horrifying amount of Sesame oil.
1324,<|emo_fear|> im feeling pretty shaky right now
1325,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite skeptical
1326,<|emo_fear|> i have a lot going on inside that is making me feel anxious and uncertain
1327,<|emo_fear|> How dare you bring in an outside perspective into a public forum that already has an inside perspective? Get out now.
1328,<|emo_fear|> im still feeling scared of it
1329,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling pretty distressed
1330,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] damn it I needed this 😂
1331,<|emo_fear|> i feel terrified like an animal
1332,<|emo_fear|> My parents are going to kill me when they find out.
1333,<|emo_fear|> They feel personally attacked
1334,<|emo_fear|> i do feel like im feeling a little afraid
1335,<|emo_fear|> i have heard a great deal about this but i feel very reluctant to go further into it now given that i already have the feeling as well as a very great deal of information on other aspects in the way to start off on
1336,<|emo_fear|> i feel very nervous and anxious about this
1337,<|emo_fear|> i hope i don t make you feel paranoid
1338,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very distraught
1339,<|emo_fear|> i want to go see the cctv because i feel so scared that he will say something bad about me
1340,<|emo_fear|> He is creepy
1341,<|emo_fear|> i can feel a little insecure in this
1342,<|emo_fear|> That sounds terrible. I am very sorry.
1343,<|emo_fear|> im feeling so hesitant to start
1344,<|emo_fear|> Isnt that the god awful truth
1345,<|emo_fear|> i woke up feeling slightly frightened and then i thought perhaps the most fantastic thing i have ever seen
1346,<|emo_fear|> This looks sick
1347,<|emo_fear|> That looks awful
1348,<|emo_fear|> It's creepy that he's proudly wearing a mask like that
1349,<|emo_fear|> i started feeling extremely unsure about everything
1350,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to turn it down right now because thats what i would like to do
1351,<|emo_fear|> That is very disturbing.... Can you imagine if a natural disaster devastated your town and forced you to evacuate?
1352,<|emo_fear|> i would also say i began to feel agitated very quickly
1353,"<|emo_fear|> I'm concerned about spammy lists, not about what a non-SPAM list looks like."
1354,<|emo_fear|> Well that's horrifying
1355,<|emo_fear|> i went back to my room feeling nervous but very calm amp excited about the possibility of feeling a bit more adventurous or wild
1356,<|emo_fear|> i just tell him how i feel but its too dangerous
1358,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling very anxious and alone
1359,<|emo_fear|> im feeling quite skeptical
1360,<|emo_fear|> Oh [NAME] I almost forgot about that!
1361,"<|emo_fear|> That's pretty lewd. He also posted a video of him smoking crack, you'd be surprised how many times that's even crossed his mind."
1362,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite unsure about anything after this
1363,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little apprehensive going into this one
1364,<|emo_fear|> This is horribly creepy. Eleven??? A baby? I can’t think of anything horrific enough to make me sick.
1365,<|emo_fear|> i feel shy of others not able to make eye contact without an awkward smile
1366,<|emo_fear|> The only regret I had in high school was playing video games with friends
1367,<|emo_fear|> i love your username xD
1368,<|emo_fear|> i feel very anxious about coming out no
1369,"<|emo_fear|> i am feeling a little reluctant to post this out of fear of potential readers reading the blog and thinking ""oh, this is how he did it"". please bear with me"
1370,<|emo_fear|> im still really feeling hesitant to tell my parents
1371,<|emo_fear|> i felt a little bit strange
1372,<|emo_fear|> i didn t think this was possible and im still afraid for the fate of my son
1373,<|emo_fear|> i can feel the frantic urge to continue the story
1374,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little paranoid about it all
1375,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure or overwhelmed during that time
1376,"<|emo_fear|> Oh no, is that you?"
1377,<|emo_fear|> Because he was the most hated man in the world at the time? Stop talking nonsense about history
1378,<|emo_fear|> Not the same girl. The only thing that’s different is how much she looks 16.
1379,<|emo_fear|> im feeling more anxious than ever
1380,<|emo_fear|> im feeling quite emotional tonight
1382,"<|emo_fear|> [NAME] was having a really bad day, which may be why the video was cut, but the jump in the first 4 seconds is still uncomfortable"
1383,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared for this baby
1384,<|emo_fear|> i thought i should feel ashamed of how stupid i was
1385,<|emo_fear|> i had already gone through and i was feeling the nerves and anxiety
1386,<|emo_fear|> i am sitting down to write this i feel so overwhelmed and not entirely sure why
1387,<|emo_fear|> i feel weird about admitting i didn t do a research paper
1388,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling a tad apprehensive of it all as it does seem to only make me stronger in some ways
1389,<|emo_fear|> i started feeling apprehensive
1391,<|emo_fear|> i feel very helpless to do anything to help
1392,<|emo_fear|> Oof. Wasn't expecting a fat guy to be this embarrassed
1393,<|emo_fear|> This is actually scary.
1394,<|emo_fear|> He is a very dangerous man
1395,<|emo_fear|> i feel terrified that i wont be accepted
1396,<|emo_fear|> i feel fearful because i can see it
1397,<|emo_fear|> That face looks so scary 😔
1398,"<|emo_fear|> Damn it, [NAME]!"
1399,<|emo_fear|> I'm scared for y'all saying [NAME] didn't do a poor job.
1400,<|emo_fear|> i came out of the episode feeling shaken and doubtful
1401,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im in a weird place where im still uncertain like that is to be expected
1402,<|emo_fear|> I’m scared for [NAME]!
1404,<|emo_fear|> The cringe is real
1405,<|emo_fear|> A year ago I thought this was an extremely reasonable concern. I still do. But now...it worries me.
1407,<|emo_fear|> i feel shy to talk to him
1408,<|emo_fear|> i feel fearful of being noticed
1409,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very skeptical right now
1410,<|emo_fear|> i think it would be a bit too much to expect for the next game to be anywhere near as frantic as the last but i feel hopeful
1411,<|emo_fear|> Oh for sure. That video is sick.
1412,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling fearful and i thought something had moved in the dark out of the corner of my eye
1413,<|emo_fear|> i dont want to give anything away this is what i feel is scary if they dont want me to be afraid of what i can and cannot say i love you
1414,<|emo_fear|> Ouch! I felt that!
1415,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little apprehensive about it
1416,<|emo_fear|> This is my worst fear
1417,<|emo_fear|> i had an interesting nightmare i felt like i was a child who was terrified and could not talk
1418,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling uncertain and unsure as i walked through the complex
1419,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling uncertain and afraid
1420,<|emo_fear|> i feel that as long as you have nothing in hand and something to look forward to you have been punished enough
1421,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling very emotional and insecure
1422,<|emo_fear|> im feeling terrified of hurting him more and more
1423,<|emo_fear|> i feel vulnerable because i am
1424,<|emo_fear|> > But he's been terrible against the Hawks in PF/Cajual this year. In other years he'd be great
1425,<|emo_fear|> i feel pressured to write after i talk with people for the first time and i realize that i write with a sense of calm and perfect self control
1426,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little more intimidated
1427,<|emo_fear|> I'm really afraid to tell her :(
1428,<|emo_fear|> i felt nervous about it because i thought theyd be more confident to admit they were feeling pressured into these talks they had the biggest trust with the girl and that scared me
1429,<|emo_fear|> i honestly feel shaken up and anxious
1430,<|emo_fear|> i remember feeling very terrified
1431,<|emo_fear|> i have been feeling insecure and scared
1432,<|emo_fear|> i don t know why but im starting to feel more anxious
1433,<|emo_fear|> i remember going back to see if i wanted to join her at all and feeling like im about to be a heartless bitch
1434,<|emo_fear|> You know I’m thinking he falls into the older group. 1. He’s scared of touching sensitive places 2. He’s afraid of failure 3. Is afraid to have his photo taken in a public place
1435,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel afraid of what someone might say to me
1436,<|emo_fear|> i feel this weird sense of self panic
1437,<|emo_fear|> i couldnt help but feel a little helpless
1438,<|emo_fear|> i honestly feel apprehensive and almost overwhelmed
1439,<|emo_fear|> i have not thought but it feels a strange sort of knowing that you are so afraid of him
1440,<|emo_fear|> i feel overwhelmed with responsibility
1441,<|emo_fear|> im feeling less paranoid now
1442,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling very pressured and it has been a nightmare
1443,<|emo_fear|> The guy has a weird sense of humor.
1444,<|emo_fear|> This is horrific
1445,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared and alone even
1446,<|emo_fear|> i feel very intimidated by my own power
1447,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite unsure and even more anxious
1448,<|emo_fear|> I’m a big horror fan but if the monster was a ghost it wouldn’t have such an impact on the way I experienced it. 
1449,<|emo_fear|> i feel that my life may be quite boring
1450,<|emo_fear|> i feel about being scared
1451,<|emo_fear|> i feel doubtful of my skills at it
1452,<|emo_fear|> i feel shy now for the first time in years
1453,"<|emo_fear|> This will forever be my greatest fear, never to see a triumphant american flag"
1454,<|emo_fear|> He’s a little kid! How scary!
1455,"<|emo_fear|> I have yet to see this. It's terrible and seems specific to this thread. It's also weird, doesn't it?"
1456,"<|emo_fear|> As a long timeuser ofiate, this is pretty bad."
1457,<|emo_fear|> i feel fearful because i dont know what is going to come of this
1458,"<|emo_fear|> That’s a horrible take, especially since the girl is in her early 20's. Very possible that she saw a horror movie"
1459,<|emo_fear|> i feel insecure as in I am afraid that someone will notice and notice how i am wearing certain clothing
1460,<|emo_fear|> i feel somewhat reluctant to post here because im afraid no one will be able to understand the actual meaning i want to��
1461,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid he will call me back tomorrow
1462,<|emo_fear|> i want this to be a test for me and my husband when we start dating again and i dont want this to see as a one time thing
1463,<|emo_fear|> i dont mean to sound paranoid im just really scared
1464,<|emo_fear|> It’s a great feeling to know that no matter what kind of job you have there is always someone willing to take a chance on you
1465,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling very unsure and quite anxious as i followed her from building to building
1466,<|emo_fear|> i feel uncertain of my future
1467,<|emo_fear|> i did feel a little nervous watching the race
1468,"<|emo_fear|> I would give that a shot, but would worry a ton more about it not being the case."
1469,"<|emo_fear|> Well, this is terrifying."
1470,<|emo_fear|> I'm too afraid to take my dog for walks anymore. They're so scared.
1471,"<|emo_fear|> So, that's what makes him so dangerous - he doesn't hide his face, he just smiles."
1472,<|emo_fear|> I would be afraid he’s going to hurt me or something
1473,<|emo_fear|> i hate feeling so uncertain about everything
1474,<|emo_fear|> i feel so vulnerable and i worry that weve lost the fight
1475,"<|emo_fear|> This really scares me. Tell them to stop feeding the lions, it's just incredibly cruel."
1476,<|emo_fear|> I'd be creeped out. especially when she asks for a picture.
1477,<|emo_fear|> We did it... YOU DID IT!
1479,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared and scared for you
1480,"<|emo_fear|> I thought so! I mean, no one would ever say or do that to me, but that's just sad. "
1481,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] just attacked me for having an open-field agenda for the [NAME] game. I'm shocked he's still a mod.
1482,<|emo_fear|> i remember feeling helpless and hopeless
1483,<|emo_fear|> i feel agitated and out of sorts
1484,<|emo_fear|> Not for long.
1485,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared that i dont know what to do
1486,<|emo_fear|> i want to be less fearful of death and more excited to wake up in the middle of a night and be there when god has called me and told me he wants me to be His mother
1487,<|emo_fear|> That’s awful. I’m definitely shaken.
1488,<|emo_fear|> It's very frightening
1489,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite unsure about
1491,"<|emo_fear|> The way that story is worded, I cannot believe that she was alive at the time."
1492,<|emo_fear|> i can also feel the chill in the air around me
1493,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure at times
1494,<|emo_fear|> i feel fearful to have my own money
1495,<|emo_fear|> i do know that she loves to cry and feel afraid
1496,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] I literally lost it.
1497,<|emo_fear|> i have a horrible hangover the night before that makes it difficult to sleep the night before my th birthday but i feel terrified to leave my room till i am done shaking
1498,<|emo_fear|> There's no reason someone should feel afraid of that law. It's there to protect society as a whole.
1499,<|emo_fear|> the scary thing about this post is that its being shared on a Reddit sub that prides itself on its tolerance and freedom of expression
1500,<|emo_fear|> im feeling more nervous than you though
1501,<|emo_fear|> This is truly frightening. RIP. May you find peace
1503,<|emo_fear|> i feel frightened i will go into a room and it was like that when i wanted to go into the study
1504,"<|emo_fear|> Yeah, we live in an age where a lot of these things are becoming more common."
1505,<|emo_fear|> i feel frightened and helpless
1506,<|emo_fear|> i feel vulnerable and afraid of being wrong
1507,<|emo_fear|> im feeling reluctant to write about a troubled past that may or may not exist in this life but at least we can make use of the story of our shared troubled past into a better place
1508,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling slightly shaken up
1509,<|emo_fear|> i think the most important thing is that the wordless world of books is almost entirely gone
1510,"<|emo_fear|> Oh yeah, and now you're telling me they're scared of the sky?"
1511,<|emo_fear|> that was a horrible open shot....
1512,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared and uncertain
1513,<|emo_fear|> How terrifying.
1514,<|emo_fear|> i feel so nervous about it all
1515,"<|emo_fear|> But I'm not gonna lie... It does get dark, tbh."
1516,<|emo_fear|> And [NAME]? He got called out for using his power and leadership without proper muster. Poor dude. 
1517,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared and shaky and sad sometimes like this is what it feels like to be a child again
1518,<|emo_fear|> I can't stop crying. Imagine if the baby was retarded
1519,<|emo_fear|> The only negative I found about it was the creepy music...
1520,"<|emo_fear|> A lot of times this is true, but it's not always that way."
1521,<|emo_fear|> i always feel slightly strange when i am around these people
1522,<|emo_fear|> I got scared just reading your flair
1523,<|emo_fear|> The most ridiculous thing I've ever heard someone say about [NAME].
1524,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared because everyone is always talking about me when how amazing i am and people make fun of me when i try to talk when ive to no one
1525,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling extremely hesitant to come back
1526,<|emo_fear|> im feeling shy
1527,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im a little bit afraid to admit what im really feeling for fear that ive done something wrong in this way
1528,<|emo_fear|> i still feel reluctant to talk to my parents
1529,<|emo_fear|> i began to feel weird
1530,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling apprehensive and nervous and was not comfortable in my own home
1531,<|emo_fear|> i think im going to feel a little afraid and paranoid then something will come up
1532,<|emo_fear|> i started feeling unsure of myself once i got to the office
1533,<|emo_fear|> i feel extremely overwhelmed
1534,<|emo_fear|> I felt a twinge of panic just reading that.
1536,<|emo_fear|> I am afraid you will never find a woman who has not made you feel unwelcome at your house.
1537,<|emo_fear|> i start to feel suspicious of him
1538,<|emo_fear|> She definitely had a history of bad behavior... including several police complaints.
1539,<|emo_fear|> i feel fearful and helpless
1540,<|emo_fear|> I'm a little scared but probably just alright about this.
1541,"<|emo_fear|> Ah yes, the classic [NAME] example. One of my worst nightmares actually."
1542,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to talk about it
1543,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling a little bit anxious about it
1544,<|emo_fear|> This is weird. He's fine.
1545,<|emo_fear|> That’s awful. I’m so sorry for your loss
1546,"<|emo_fear|> [NAME] and [NAME] look really, really creepy together."
1547,<|emo_fear|> im feeling quite hesitating about it all right now so im afraid i won t be completely convinced until i go to bed
1548,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling very homesick so im not feeling quite as frantic
1549,<|emo_fear|> This is actually scary. Imagine if a major league team said the namechecks were due to them not wanting to lose that trade for another team because *a* (hah).
1550,<|emo_fear|> ive been having a lot of trouble sleeping all day i didnt really feel until about an hour after i had the glasses
1552,"<|emo_fear|> It’s a disgusting, albeit relatively new, meme."
1553,<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid you'll get banned.
1554,<|emo_fear|> i have this horrifying feeling the other day that i am about to lose vital organs with my terrible eating that is only ending with my horrific behavior
1555,<|emo_fear|> i do feel hesitant to write about this
1556,"<|emo_fear|> I am seeing many of these kids, young adults, I don't know how that is normal, or even something that is acceptable? It's very disturbing."
1557,<|emo_fear|> Soooo I'm scared for y'all saying you don't want to hear about this!!!
1558,<|emo_fear|> i feel so helpless right now
1559,<|emo_fear|> i feel extremely shocked today
1560,<|emo_fear|> i love him to death but sometimes i feel like im supporting him somehow and thats scary
1562,<|emo_fear|> i feel completely terrified that i ll never be able to finish the book
1563,<|emo_fear|> I’d still rather be [NAME] after I traded away [NAME] and [NAME]!
1564,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit uncertain about this
1565,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless because im unsure how the heck to move forward at this point
1566,<|emo_fear|> i feel suspicious that i dont know much about these people other than what seems to be their primary goals
1567,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant to go and check her out
1568,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very apprehensive and doubtful
1569,<|emo_fear|> i didnt feel like i was in it emotionally
1570,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling very reluctant to get back into the game this year
1571,<|emo_fear|> i feel skeptical of his explanation
1572,<|emo_fear|> i cant help but feel a bit skeptical
1573,<|emo_fear|> This is terrible
1574,<|emo_fear|> i have an almost complete lack of sympathy for her and her problems the feelings and the actions that she has towards her family and those of her friends make me reluctant to look at her as a threat
1575,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling suspicious about this man and his life that is so amazing
1576,<|emo_fear|> Ahhh so sorry! This is awful. Your friends are safe.
1577,<|emo_fear|> i feel very reluctant to write a review on it
1578,<|emo_fear|> im just feeling a little reluctant to write about it
1579,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant with the subject matter
1580,<|emo_fear|> i feel like a frightened child yet i dare not say that for fear of making it seem too much as the childrens trusty little guns could become just as devastating as the m99
1582,<|emo_fear|> i can feel fearful or anxious
1583,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling paranoid so i asked her and honestly we all wondered what the hell had she done?
1584,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling quite overwhelmed
1585,<|emo_fear|> The only scary thing about her is that she looks exactly the same as every other woman in [RELIGION].
1586,<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid my nightmares are coming true.
1587,<|emo_fear|> i feel overwhelmed i become anxious
1588,<|emo_fear|> He got fired a few months ago for saying this about [NAME] before a group of kids. It shocked me
1589,<|emo_fear|> i feel skeptical because im not familiar with any real advice or other kinds of support services there is not an obvious way i could go about that without feeling pressured
1590,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling unsure of myself
1593,<|emo_fear|> i do know that im scared and feel restless
1594,<|emo_fear|> Damn it!
1596,<|emo_fear|> I hate that so much.
1597,<|emo_fear|> Lol that's your only excuse?
1598,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant to go back
1599,"<|emo_fear|> Because the longer we let it go, the worse it gets for them later on."
1600,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little reluctant to share
1601,<|emo_fear|> I miss the north hills bottom dollar... I want to live in the hills
1602,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little hesitant about using my real name
1603,<|emo_fear|> i feel that there is something really delicate about the air which is extremely delicate
1604,<|emo_fear|> i cant help feeling agitated because i dont think there is very much happening
1605,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] was awful this year
1606,<|emo_fear|> ive gone and told all my family and friends about it and all of this just makes me feel really heartbroken
1607,<|emo_fear|> i feel like an apprehensive girl when i first stand in front of someone who has just welcomed me into their family
1608,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] has one of the most accurateshoots I have ever seen
1609,"<|emo_fear|> The thing is, I enjoy killing children. It’s part of what I do on my playthrough days. Kids are fun to kill. "
1610,<|emo_fear|> Oh gosh gosh oh frick I can’t imagine that happening right now
1611,<|emo_fear|> i don t expect it to be perfect im just not sure i will feel brave enough to make anything out of it and then it all falls apart again
1612,<|emo_fear|> im feeling slightly apprehensive about writing tonight
1613,<|emo_fear|> I feel a bit more reassured with your answers than when I first received them. Good for you!
1614,<|emo_fear|> i feel that the reason we were attacked and abused for such years was not in spite of what the church has said we might be truthful i thought things were a bit weird
1615,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared
1616,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel helpless or hopeless
1617,<|emo_fear|> Omg creepy!
1618,<|emo_fear|> > I was there at the finish line and the cheers and hugs were incredible
1619,<|emo_fear|> i didnt feel afraid
1620,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to put the word quaker down
1621,<|emo_fear|> Oh that worries me. Could my parents get in trouble?
1622,<|emo_fear|> Oh gosh i thought I was the only one!
1623,<|emo_fear|> It was creepy
1624,<|emo_fear|> i feel more anxious and afraid on than i have in a long time
1625,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little apprehensive that we arent gonna do it
1626,<|emo_fear|> i began to feel frantic and like im gonna die
1627,<|emo_fear|> i feel really unsure about the things that i said but i did say the things i needed to say
1628,<|emo_fear|> i am not feeling fearful nor in any way shaken up by these happenings
1629,<|emo_fear|> Omg I cringe at every part of every single part of this

2039,"<|emo_fear|> You've got a bad cold, are you contagious?"
2040,<|emo_fear|> i thought he was going to start saying it when he was going into the bathroom but all that did was get me thinking about making this a bit longer
2041,<|emo_fear|> It could have been worse - the studio was filming a scene in the mountain pass and fell victim to a falling mountain.

2064,<|emo_fear|> i had said i had a feeling something would go south at some point as my mind was quickly becoming doubtful
2065,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling a bit reluctant at this point
2066,"<|emo_fear|> Oh, I wouldn't be surprised. She is a celebrity that you'd want to avoid."
2067,"<|emo_fear|> She's not a terrible person, just that she has a history of lying/forging documents/information about her past in an attempt to make her seem more innocent (e.g. background check etc). She's also an idiot"

2107,<|emo_fear|> Oh the horror.
2109,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling unsure and depressed when i went to work

2116,<|emo_fear|> I have seen kids tortured by their parents. It's so horrifying.
2117,<|emo_fear|> This is the one time I've ever said this about [NAME]. His broadcasting abilities aren't anywhere near as world-changing as some would assume. His play calling is awful as well.

2119,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a bit apprehensive about it
2120,<|emo_fear|> I just got really scared and thought I was gonna die alone for like 2 hours

2122,<|emo_fear|> i feel so completely helpless and scared
2123,<|emo_fear|> When I die...
2124,<|emo_fear|> i feel very anxious thinking about that
2125,<|emo_fear|> i feel anxious but not because my mom is sick
2126,<|emo_fear|> Agh this is so frustrating. I’m so sorry for your loss.
2127,<|emo_fear|> im feeling less fearful of giving in
2128,<|emo_fear|> i feel a sense of being helpless in this world
2129,<|emo_fear|> What a weird world we live in
2130,"<|emo_fear|> No comments yet, apologies for the late reply "
2131,<|emo_fear|> Oh that poor sap
2132,<|emo_fear|> i feel so helpless and helpless
2133,<|emo_fear|> You're just gonna lie about everything
2135,<|emo_fear|> i do feel a little anxious now but it is just a feeling now
2136,<|emo_fear|> i was surprised to feel completely helpless
2138,<|emo_fear|> i feel agitated or overwhelmed as a result
2139,<|emo_fear|> The saddest part is you’re not wrong. This is what I’ve been experiencing. This is the reality of things.
2140,<|emo_fear|> i should just be feeling less nervous
2141,<|emo_fear|> i know there are those days and nights when i feel more vulnerable than i have for months or days and nights

2149,<|emo_fear|> i see her eyes i start to feel a little hesitant for no real reason
2150,<|emo_fear|> i must have been feeling quite apprehensive
2151,<|emo_fear|> Who’s making the video? That’s terrifying
2152,<|emo_fear|> i guess im waiting for him to feel more reluctant about it
2153,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling somewhat lethargic and not very adventurous in the pool and have decided to cut myself up to give myself a little more rest and hopefully give the skin to breath and keep it from feeling so numb it feels like it is watching someone's arms over aortic valve
2154,<|emo_fear|> i can feel the frantic pace he was playing and i can hear the breathing of the young man
2155,<|emo_fear|> i had gone and sat in class feeling nervous the morning of the exam
2156,<|emo_fear|> i can feel overwhelmed by too many thoughts and things that i should do
2157,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very shaky
2158,<|emo_fear|> im feeling nervous im excited
2159,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant to say anything because I only have this idea that my own nightmare is coming true in a few short weeks
2160,<|emo_fear|> i still feel this fear and anxiety when it comes to things that were once completely unknown to me
2161,<|emo_fear|> i have also had this feeling that if i didnt know i would probably give up watching this and go back to feeling skeptical about this movie right now

2169,<|emo_fear|> That’s nightmare fuel right there
2170,<|emo_fear|> i feel insecure as i should be but my fear is of the world
2172,<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid I'm gonna give you the wrong kind of advice.
2173,<|emo_fear|> There’s a surprisingly large number of depressed/homeless kids in this area. It’s terrifying.
2175,<|emo_fear|> i was sitting at the bus stop and watched the driver stop the car and stop at the stop lights and when he re got close to the light again the person would put his hand out the window and start again
2176,<|emo_fear|> i feel nervous because sometimes i can hear things around me that would scare me
2177,"<|emo_fear|> This sounds to me like cyber stalking, and the potential for terrible consequences "
2178,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless or hopeless
2179,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little paranoid
2180,<|emo_fear|> I’m terrified..

2184,<|emo_fear|> i started that day feeling skeptical about the project
2186,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid because i do what i really must
2187,"<|emo_fear|> I think this is also his worst fear, getting lose on time"
2188,"<|emo_fear|> That’s horrible. He’s a very good writer, it’s terrible that this has happened."
2189,"<|emo_fear|> If he doesn’t pay up soon, that’s all there is to lose on a trade. Hard to see him doing worse than expected."

2195,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little bit weird
2196,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared all the time
2197,<|emo_fear|> ive always hated the feeling when i was trying to sleep but i couldn t think of anything more horrible than being awake and just woke up with a horrible dream
2198,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling very shaky and had a poor memory
2199,<|emo_fear|> i feel agitated by it all
2200,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to write down a name of fear
2201,<|emo_fear|> i do not usually write of this but i am feeling pretty frantic these days
2202,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant that i don t know what i want to do with my life right now
2203,<|emo_fear|> i feel slightly helpless and want to keep looking for solution
2204,"<|emo_fear|> That's true, and scary at the same time."
2205,<|emo_fear|> i feel pressured to finish it in my free time so i end up writing what the story is telling and the characters and the situations i imagine happening

2210,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure of myself as a person
2211,<|emo_fear|> i think these are all things i need to be more fearful of even now if im feeling anxious right now or if im feeling fearful and anxious that is
2213,<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid all that will be is even worse.
2214,<|emo_fear|> i have to deal with the feeling i am a little afraid i ve betrayed the trust
2215,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] was playing catch up and hadnt scored in 10 games going into this game. Loved seeing him this game.

2225,<|emo_fear|> i felt like im getting this really scary read from a young woman in the know about what is going on in her family but i was very reluctant to put it down and instead kept on reading

2227,<|emo_fear|> My husband's death has left me devastated for the first time in years.

2263,<|emo_fear|> Lol okay glad to hear this. I’d be terrified to ask.

2387,<|emo_fear|> It’s awful.

2403,<|emo_fear|> i could still feel a strange sense of anxiety coming over me
2404,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless and hopeless
2405,<|emo_fear|> Oh no! Poor cat!
2406,<|emo_fear|> I'm scared out there
2407,<|emo_fear|> i began to feel reluctant
2408,<|emo_fear|> i do feel very intimidated

2420,<|emo_fear|> oh my [NAME]
2421,<|emo_fear|> I feel your pain...
2422,"<|emo_fear|> Not surprised, because that's what they said. I'm afraid they'll just ignore it."
2423,<|emo_fear|> ive gone through years of feeling pretty skeptical about the wonders of human emotion and yet oh my gosh the things we humans do cause us to become very vulnerable to human abuse
2424,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling a little hesitant
2426,<|emo_fear|> I can’t imagine anyone is more devastated by a horrific accident than an addison rabbit.
2427,<|emo_fear|> i know exactly how i feel when im with a boy at work im quite terrified that im about to turn into the next one
2428,"<|emo_fear|> I'm so sorry it happened that way, I hope it never happens again. You're right. "

2440,<|emo_fear|> i have been feeling unsure a lot of the time lately
2441,<|emo_fear|> im feeling really agitated right now
2442,<|emo_fear|> i had heard about these groups but i didnt feel like im too weirded out by them
2443,<|emo_fear|> So much fake news.
2444,<|emo_fear|> That looks horrible.
2445,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel fearful of being sick
2446,<|emo_fear|> i think all of that to begin with the pressure i was feeling when he came in and said my parents are going to be worried because i have a plan for the rest of the summer and i can handle that
2447,<|emo_fear|> i feel a strange sense of relief
2448,<|emo_fear|> Not exactly the kind of confidence I'd want my daughter to have in me 🙏
2449,<|emo_fear|> i feel so nervous all the time we are so overwhelmed with things constantly but never really put enough thought into them
2450,<|emo_fear|> I can’t even imagine the pain that it must have caused her to let that come out.
2451,<|emo_fear|> No. Stop. This is disgusting.
2452,"<|emo_fear|> ""Saving The World"" and ""Houses Of The World"" are my two favorite songs on there."
2453,<|emo_fear|> i feel more terrified of death
2454,<|emo_fear|> Is it weird to say they don't care or at least they're okay with it? I thought the same with my parents.
2455,<|emo_fear|> i could feel my brain aching more often
2456,<|emo_fear|> So edgy.
2458,<|emo_fear|> i really feel scared
2459,<|emo_fear|> I have been getting scared of doors in the House. Maybe I am just scared of myself.
2460,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to get on my scooter to go into the woods again

2465,<|emo_fear|> i can feel anxious in general
2466,"<|emo_fear|> ""We are too damn rich, so we have to give you free stuff for free."""

2470,"<|emo_fear|> Oh, that's awful!"
2471,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] is bad... [NAME] is worse... I really hope he's the first guy called.
2472,"<|emo_fear|> When this happens, I get paranoid that I'm getting old and that somehow I'm going to die alone "
2473,<|emo_fear|> They’re afraid to be associated with [NAME]
2474,<|emo_fear|> i could feel my body getting agitated again
2476,"<|emo_fear|> In order to make a good joke you have to be able to think on your feet, which i think i have been unable to do this past semester. "
2477,"<|emo_fear|> im feeling very reluctant and somewhat ashamed, but not out loud or at the dinner table"
2478,"<|emo_fear|> Oh no, he's in pain"
2479,<|emo_fear|> i am just feeling very paranoid right now what could have possibly made me do this
2480,<|emo_fear|> i hate feeling this terrified of what this monster may do to us
2481,<|emo_fear|> i have been feeling very apprehensive just lately about all of the things i want to do and want to write about
2482,<|emo_fear|> The worst is working with dealerships 
2483,<|emo_fear|> i feel very uncertain i am not sure what the answer will be
2484,"<|emo_fear|> Oh sorry, didmt know"
2485,"<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid to look, but I can ask my church leader."
2487,<|emo_fear|> It worries me he thinks that.

2491,<|emo_fear|> i feel uncomfortable being with my parents but i guess that is just my natural reaction
2492,<|emo_fear|> i think a lot of people feel slightly intimidated by someone who they think they know well
2493,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite agitated and disoriented
2494,<|emo_fear|> i feel so vulnerable in so much of my life to the sense that i ve gone off the deep end

2498,"<|emo_fear|> I’m afraid I just can’t do it, he’s so high and I’m broke like 30 pounds..."
2500,<|emo_fear|> That sounds terrible 😢
2501,<|emo_fear|> i feel nervous as if everything i hold is gonna fall into the abyss
2502,<|emo_fear|> i also feel vulnerable and i think about why im doing this
2503,<|emo_fear|> Damn....
2504,<|emo_fear|> this was a horrible fix
2505,<|emo_fear|> You are terrifying
2506,<|emo_fear|> i can see myself feeling confused about how these things relate to people and what im scared is a lot of them
2507,<|emo_fear|> It sounds spasticated.
2508,<|emo_fear|> i feel so tortured looking at him for no reason at all

2513,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel nervous
2515,<|emo_fear|> i feel very confused when i go to see him
2516,<|emo_fear|> It’s a huge pain in the ass to dismount
2517,<|emo_fear|> The scary part is that they are still allowed to buy guns...
2518,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little apprehensive about getting back at those people
2519,<|emo_fear|> It's kinda odd to find someone who's never heard of Reddit in their background.
2520,<|emo_fear|> My entire life’s been a lie
2521,<|emo_fear|> oh my [NAME] this thing is terrifying
2522,<|emo_fear|> i didnt really know how i was feeling out of control or how bad it was really
2523,<|emo_fear|> im feeling incredibly nervous about it
2524,<|emo_fear|> i got up there and left feeling skeptical about all things spengler and skeptical about the writer for the title
2525,<|emo_fear|> I would start freaking out on that for sure.
2526,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling shaky and weak in the early hours of yesterday morning
2527,<|emo_fear|> i do know is that if my parents had not been able to understand this i would have been more reluctant to leave
2528,<|emo_fear|> I'm not sure how to explain but I feel the most strongly that [NAME] is evil and he wants to turn all of society against itself.
2529,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very doubtful and doubtful of this
2530,<|emo_fear|> i have a lot to learn and this has left me feeling extremely insecure
2531,<|emo_fear|> ive seen this before and it made me feel uncomfortable and the only thing to do was turn around and walk away
2532,<|emo_fear|> This hurts me.
2533,<|emo_fear|> This may or may not have been true back in the day. My advice to them is to simply shut up and be afraid for your life.
2534,<|emo_fear|> This is scary to know that you went through.
2535,"<|emo_fear|> I can't imagine it being this bad for a while, you guys. "
2536,<|emo_fear|> i feel that at least for a second there i felt frightened for a third more terrifying i am anxious that i could be wrong
2537,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid by it all
2538,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel fearful or nervous any more
2539,<|emo_fear|> What a sad post omg
2540,"<|emo_fear|> I don’t have a lot of sympathy for the depressed, but I would say there’s a really high chance they’re experiencing episodes of major depression."
2541,<|emo_fear|> There was a horrible accident
2542,<|emo_fear|> That must hurt.
2543,<|emo_fear|> i could feel a little more uptight around her and i wasnt being ourselves around her i started to make more efforts to be considerate of her and try to be supportive of her whenever she was feeling unsure
2544,<|emo_fear|> It is with great sadness that we learnt today that [NAME] has passed away.
2545,<|emo_fear|> i feel so uncertain and scared to know what s next
2546,<|emo_fear|> i feel paranoid when i am alone
2547,<|emo_fear|> i had not felt like it much it was not enough to make me feel ashamed
2548,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit doubtful about other people who have had incredible success and are now finding it difficult to deal with the memory of their achievements
2549,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im a little paranoid and i guess i am
2550,<|emo_fear|> i also feel fearful anxious and somewhat sad at the same time
2552,<|emo_fear|> She's not dead. She's in a creepy dream.
2553,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless and alone it never looks good
2554,<|emo_fear|> oh my gosh

2556,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling anxious on a sunday night
2557,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling quite unsure
2558,<|emo_fear|> i can sense a little bit more from him if you can imagine feeling surprised when i feel something isn t what i expected
2560,<|emo_fear|> I'm scared too
2562,<|emo_fear|> I'd be scared too if I were that age
2563,<|emo_fear|> i feel anxious often
2564,<|emo_fear|> He must smell terrible when he sweats. I’ve had it with cataracts already.
2565,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling a bit apprehensive about this as well
2566,<|emo_fear|> Oh that's awful.
2567,<|emo_fear|> i can t help but think how lucky i am to be working with such wonderful people and to have such amazing colleagues
2568,<|emo_fear|> I remember when I started working in hospitals I was scared shitless because no one would interview me and they would just use the ER numbers and numbers that they had on the record.
2569,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid of how people will treat me if i don t follow their example
2570,<|emo_fear|> i went to bed feeling afraid and woke up a few hours later with a strange feeling in my heart
2571,<|emo_fear|> I was afraid he was going to start freaking out
2572,<|emo_fear|> I’m scared for y’all who are against this because if this is a thing people will stop using phones and will instead use smart phones instead...or even just beards
2573,<|emo_fear|> i feel this shy around my friends but im not at all afraid
2574,<|emo_fear|> i want to die it is so infuriating to think about it
2576,<|emo_fear|> She lost more!
2578,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling very very apprehensive and overwhelmed
2579,<|emo_fear|> i feel fearful more
2580,<|emo_fear|> You die.
2581,<|emo_fear|> i woke up feeling frightened of everything that is out there
2582,<|emo_fear|> i feel confused and nervous
2583,<|emo_fear|> im feeling quite indecisive right now
2584,<|emo_fear|> It was my first thought but then I thought about children and the thoughts of rape and incest...
2585,<|emo_fear|> It was a horrible call.
2586,<|emo_fear|> i feel more and more uncomfortable with the way that i look and the way that i talk all the time
2587,<|emo_fear|> I can definitely relate but that's all I've heard so far. I feel like I'm the only one.
2588,<|emo_fear|> That's disgusting.
2589,<|emo_fear|> i must feel a bit intimidated
2590,<|emo_fear|> i cant give up just yet but i feel helpless
2591,<|emo_fear|> i feel so helpless and out there
2592,<|emo_fear|> i began to feel overwhelmed with the weight of responsibilities that come with running a business
2593,<|emo_fear|> i feel really paranoid now
2594,"<|emo_fear|> >...but he is a very active churchgoingist and anti-intellectual Probably not surprising, since he has stated quite clearly that he was a regular churchgoer."
2595,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very uncertain about everything right now
2597,"<|emo_fear|> I can feel him, his breath on my neck... "
2598,<|emo_fear|> The sad part is that [NAME] is only 31....
2599,<|emo_fear|> That was truly disheartening to read.
2600,<|emo_fear|> Oh you're so right!
2602,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little weird about myself and
2603,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling confused about why everything was going so well for us but i think its been working
2604,<|emo_fear|> i really feel a bit weird about it
2605,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling a bit anxious and want to check the weather before i go to bed
2606,<|emo_fear|> i actually feel fearful that my future is going to be looked at in a less negative light
2608,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling extremely anxious about my performance at the tryouts
2609,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling suspicious and wondered what the heck was going on
2610,"<|emo_fear|> I think that this is a bit dangerous, but I suppose it is worth trying :). I'm also interested to know if it would work with characters with resistances."
2611,<|emo_fear|> i can remember feeling so uncertain about anything
2612,<|emo_fear|> i think it may be even more than that because it seems to me that she is feeling reluctant to leave
2613,<|emo_fear|> The only one to say no to an ownership dinner
2614,<|emo_fear|> i also didn t feel vulnerable

3099,<|emo_fear|> i went straight into feeling confused
3100,<|emo_fear|> I feel you. Scary stuff.

3128,<|emo_fear|> It's the worst when the person trying to do something easy then gets stuck doing something harder afterwards...

3155,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant to call it a horror since i know how easily it could be abused
3156,<|emo_fear|> i just want to get back on track as its been a long time and im not feeling completely terrified
3157,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure and agitated
3158,<|emo_fear|> i would try to tell my mom but i would feel weird being told what to do

3164,<|emo_fear|> i feel the most skeptical of the market at this point
3165,<|emo_fear|> > And the fact that he went on to co authors a book which implies that same sort of thing. Wow this is really just another sign that he's really not that socially liberal.

3173,<|emo_fear|> i came home feeling shaken and scared
3174,<|emo_fear|> im feeling apprehensive and nervous as i approach the finish line
3176,"<|emo_fear|> Oh man, I didn't know [NAME] was that involved until I saw his video. Scary..tune down [NAME] to a sub you can watch"
3177,<|emo_fear|> I’ve had sleep paralysis once and it was terrifying.
3178,<|emo_fear|> This makes me feel really old.
3179,<|emo_fear|> I can't imagine a society in which you're accepted into a home without questions being asked and you have to prove you're not sick. 
3181,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling anxious anxious anxious anxious more anxious

3232,<|emo_fear|> Who would have guessed that? The last few issues are pretty amazing.
3233,<|emo_fear|> i was surprised by how quickly it was accepted because it was not a satire or a satire of some type
3234,<|emo_fear|> of fucking terrifying
3235,<|emo_fear|> And they will be hard to home-school though. And that is a further burden for our society

3269,<|emo_fear|> The way people talk about the 'right to bear arms' and that 'right to self defense' is horrible.
3270,<|emo_fear|> i feel terrified for them
3271,<|emo_fear|> i can feel helpless and out of control
3272,<|emo_fear|> Ahhh a horror!
3273,<|emo_fear|> i feel this strange sense of helplessness
3274,<|emo_fear|> i feel extremely helpless to do anything right now
3275,<|emo_fear|> This story made my day. Ha!
3276,<|emo_fear|> i have been feeling slightly overwhelmed lately and just cant seem to get myself to actually write anything
3277,<|emo_fear|> i feel shaken that we didnt get to see some of the stuff i shot
3278,<|emo_fear|> im feeling shaky and mouthy but like it s all going to feel super normal in no time
3279,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant about going back but i understand
3281,<|emo_fear|> oh [NAME] she dead
3282,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling a little reluctant because of how painful it has made work for me
3283,<|emo_fear|> im feeling nervous and anxious as my days go on and the months go by
3284,<|emo_fear|> i feel so scared to put it into words
3285,<|emo_fear|> i know i should feel relieved and excited that i am not the only one feeling this way but i am worried
3286,<|emo_fear|> They always make me feel so stupid 😂 Im 30. I still love going out in treacherous weather.
3287,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a bit uncertain about this right now
3288,<|emo_fear|> The only thing I fear more than a giant robot mouth is having to watch myself
3289,<|emo_fear|> the other night i got really wet and fell onto some clothes. i could feel myself getting distressed
3291,<|emo_fear|> i woke up on my couch feeling strange
3292,"<|emo_fear|> We’re scared of him, we’re never gonna trust him again."
3293,<|emo_fear|> i feel weird and afraid
3294,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling pretty overwhelmed right now
3295,<|emo_fear|> i know is that with the pressure on me and feeling pressured by the people sitting next to me i feel pressured to get a word in
3296,<|emo_fear|> i would feel more hesitant about getting into therapy if im having a hard time sleeping and i didnt want to worry about it
3297,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little nervous
3298,<|emo_fear|> This just reminded me that I need to find a place to be a good person.
3299,<|emo_fear|> i remember feeling distressed and afraid of crying because i did
3301,<|emo_fear|> i feel the least bit fearful for my children if i amnt careful with them
3302,<|emo_fear|> i did feel weird and wanted to lie down and cry but i couldnt
3303,<|emo_fear|> When I see people talking trash on the sub it makes me cringe just thinking about it
3305,<|emo_fear|> i guess i have a kind of numb feeling something like the kind of fear and trepidation i have also
3306,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling weird but i was having problems with my memory after reading this story
3307,<|emo_fear|> My god. The faces in that drawing are just horrifying.
3308,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling more nervous this week than i have in a while
3309,<|emo_fear|> i feel tortured reading your words
3310,<|emo_fear|> i didnt feel tortured or anything i honestly thought she was as innocent as i said she was for some reason
3311,<|emo_fear|> when i was still in primary school
3312,<|emo_fear|> i feel weird telling people about that though
3314,"<|emo_fear|> I didn't think I'd see a comrade there, but we did."
3315,<|emo_fear|> A bit creepy
3316,<|emo_fear|> i feel as if im being tortured
3317,<|emo_fear|> Well good for you... I think I'm going to kick myself for expecting that...
3319,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im being a little paranoid
3320,<|emo_fear|> The weirdest thing about it is that people are actually asking for tips to avoid this.
3321,<|emo_fear|> Omg scary!
3323,<|emo_fear|> i just wanted to feel like i m not alone
3324,<|emo_fear|> i know that it s the worst feeling when you don t know what s real and what is a lie
3325,<|emo_fear|> Because as an introvert that usually means I'm extremely shy.
3326,<|emo_fear|> He should be out for a while and shaken up a little. Sounds a little familiar...
3327,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling so overwhelmed with work and i feel helpless and helpless but my dream is not in vain
3328,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im always stressed because im always anxious
3329,"<|emo_fear|> Oh my god, there is no way that she didn't say something along these lines. What a nightmare"
3330,"<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid I'll pick something else, like ""[NAME]"""
3331,<|emo_fear|> It's a really scary feeling actually. CBB urges people to call the police if they experience similar symptoms. You can't help but be afraid of the unknown.
3332,<|emo_fear|> i feel more scared to go outside by myself now
3333,<|emo_fear|> This literally made my stomach clench. I can't believe they're even charged for bringing in the rubbish.
3334,"<|emo_fear|> [NAME] and [NAME] are friends. There is an awkward silence in the depths of his eyes after each word he says, and [NAME] is surprised he doesn't just turn and face her. "
3335,"<|emo_fear|> Damn it, they all look so fluffy :D"
3336,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little skeptical about what the new video might tell us
3337,<|emo_fear|> The only thing that would truly make her death more horrific
3338,"<|emo_fear|> Well the point is the same, I'm really against the idea of him fighting [NAME] and it would make the move more awkward."
3339,<|emo_fear|> i remember feeling very reluctant to take the next step but still feeling apprehensive
3340,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid for you
3341,<|emo_fear|> i started feeling very doubtful for the first time in my life
3342,<|emo_fear|> i get a feeling that hes afraid to let this one out right now i really dont want to stand in front of the mirror he is probably a bit apprehensive
3343,<|emo_fear|> And so are you!
3344,<|emo_fear|> i can understand that people are feeling apprehensive about coming out
3346,<|emo_fear|> What about the poor fish :(
3347,"<|emo_fear|> I remember my reaction. I thought he was going to trip and fall. I was very, very afraid for that kid."
3349,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little unsure how i feel about myself
3350,<|emo_fear|> I’m scared to tell my family
3351,<|emo_fear|> I have the same problem and it's worse
3352,"<|emo_fear|> [NAME] had the exact same issues last year, this year I'm concerned he hasn't been 100% and I feel bad for our younger DPs"
3353,<|emo_fear|> He's creepy
3355,<|emo_fear|> I’m a little worried that the car might damage the footwell
3356,<|emo_fear|> I miss big daddy buff
3358,<|emo_fear|> i get the feeling that i am going to have some very bad news but i feel scared because it is my second story there
3359,<|emo_fear|> im feeling fearful that this was the last time he would ever be on this earth
3360,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little pressured that i should keep writing and i can t be a mom
3361,<|emo_fear|> This looks like a nightmare.
3362,<|emo_fear|> i feel intimidated and scared to take on a new project
3363,<|emo_fear|> im feeling fearful and very apprehensive when i look at the blackened rice paperings
3364,<|emo_fear|> i feel pretty insecure about my voice especially if im going to use it any place other than a generic speaking speaking role
3365,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very paranoid
3366,<|emo_fear|> im feeling quite uncertain about my science
3367,<|emo_fear|> The fact that she was a woman made me afraid to hire her.
3368,"<|emo_fear|> She wanted to kill [NAME] but he was close friends with [NAME], so she couldn't. "
3370,<|emo_fear|> ive had them so many times at work that i feel overwhelmed and overwhelmed by all the stuff i have no way of organization around how i will deal with it
3371,<|emo_fear|> i know if i am feeling anxiety im gonna be a little less shy
3372,<|emo_fear|> i just feel really intimidated by it all
3373,<|emo_fear|> i often feel uncertain and anxious and depressed
3374,<|emo_fear|> i feel terrified and out of control about this coming summer
3375,<|emo_fear|> i do feel a bit nervous but i hope i wont let it get the better of me
3376,<|emo_fear|> i am not feeling fearful scared excited or anything of the sort
3377,<|emo_fear|> i came in to an information booth and sat down to ask a few questions
3378,<|emo_fear|> i had no way of knowing they were going to make me feel terrified im not sure
3379,<|emo_fear|> i went to bed feeling confused and still the next morning i woke up in the middle of the night wanting to know why the hell i was sleeping so well
3381,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] is a terrible shooter
3382,<|emo_fear|> That body language is so scary
3383,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a bit apprehensive about my work flow these days
3384,<|emo_fear|> In that case why did you become a [NAME] then? Where were you when [NAME] was committing treason? I feel kinda bad for them.
3385,<|emo_fear|> i feel so tortured with indecipherable words as if i were making them up
3386,<|emo_fear|> I've never heard of a study on this before...it sounds awful.
3387,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant to use the terms mental health crisis and panic attack but that is the one that terrified me the most it sounds more like a horrible nightmare and is only slightly better at helping me sleep sometimes
3388,<|emo_fear|> i feel pretty vulnerable in that way
3389,"<|emo_fear|> No, it was never that kind of hearing!"
3390,<|emo_fear|> No one cares my guy
3391,<|emo_fear|> i cant help but feeling a bit paranoid
3392,"<|emo_fear|> The fact that it's on Reddit is a bit horrifying. Unless you're talking about highly specific situations where Reddit isn't such an issue, I'd say take your upvote for this one safe."
3393,<|emo_fear|> the terrifying truth
3394,<|emo_fear|> This is so scary to know that you went through. I hope you are doing well! ❤️
3395,<|emo_fear|> im feeling afraid that theyre coming around to me asap

3401,<|emo_fear|> i started feeling paranoid a month into the relationship
3402,<|emo_fear|> I wish we were so lucky...
3403,"<|emo_fear|> It looks like a fake ID, the only way I can see it being USlegal is through a Healthcare worker program!"
3404,<|emo_fear|> i did feel quite fearful
3405,<|emo_fear|> I’m afraid I’m gonna lose my shit when I read it all.
3406,<|emo_fear|> I never thought to look it up but it apparently doesn't exist! I am seriously freaking out now.
3407,<|emo_fear|> i get on the bike and feel a bit weird as i do those sorts of stops and rollouts
3408,<|emo_fear|> im feeling vulnerable and worried that im seeing things that im not
3409,<|emo_fear|> My mom works for Nasa too. I'm really scared for her safety.
3410,<|emo_fear|> i can feel the pressure building to either do things the way i am or change and make me break
3411,"<|emo_fear|> I don’t know what the ""Mining for Food Scam"" sounds like, so let me say it's kinda scary. "
3412,<|emo_fear|> i still feel a little paranoid
3413,<|emo_fear|> i would feel nervous doing that.
3414,<|emo_fear|> What a fucking pathetic post omg
3415,<|emo_fear|> i feel nervous just looking at this
3416,"<|emo_fear|> So, y'know, the old saying is if you see a black bear, run away"
3417,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im a pretty scaredy cute kitty
3418,<|emo_fear|> How scary. I hope she doesn't kill you. My best friend would be more at risk.
3419,<|emo_fear|> i could feel it but i also could not tell if it was fear or the heat
3420,<|emo_fear|> i feel insecure and feel like just leaving without telling my parents
3421,"<|emo_fear|> Oh my god, he has a beard!"
3422,"<|emo_fear|> I'm sorry for you, but your parents probably aren't being very sympathetic."
3423,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared when the wind blows
3424,<|emo_fear|> i feel very helpless as i try to do all the small things that i feel should be my responsibilities
3425,<|emo_fear|> i feel insecure and guilty

3427,<|emo_fear|> i feel less shy around them
3429,<|emo_fear|> i can really tell your body feels a little uncertain about how i am running
3430,<|emo_fear|> i had a feeling that this was something of a dare i said no
3431,<|emo_fear|> What an ass. I hope she doesn't damage the already poor car.
3432,<|emo_fear|> i feel agitated and out of touch with reality
3433,<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid I'm going to lose power
3434,<|emo_fear|> She sounds hideous.
3435,<|emo_fear|> Omg I’m dying
3436,<|emo_fear|> i feel like a helpless child i feel like im so helpless

3438,<|emo_fear|> i have also not felt like i am scared
3439,<|emo_fear|> i feel so nervous with him
3442,<|emo_fear|> The sad part is this is almost certainly the start of a lot worse for the environment/humans overall.
3443,<|emo_fear|> i feel doubtful and uncertain about everything
3444,<|emo_fear|> im feeling somewhat apprehensive about this
3445,"<|emo_fear|> Well, my point is if this is true and the reason you gave the reason for it is to make you miserable, then you're a terrible, horrible person."
3446,"<|emo_fear|> ""Fuck you, [NAME]"""
3447,<|emo_fear|> i just feel so vulnerable without it
3448,<|emo_fear|> i still feel very distressed this morning
3449,<|emo_fear|> i feel so scared and helpless
3450,"<|emo_fear|> I'm really scared for them, they don't have a lot of protection from the police lol."
3451,<|emo_fear|> i feel insecure because people know that i cannot always be my best when im stressed
3452,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] looks horrible
3453,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im really insecure
3454,"<|emo_fear|> I can’t relate but I’ve been to six countries in the last year, and I’m terrified for business travel "
3455,"<|emo_fear|> The fact that someone has a Twitter account at all tells me they're quite active on there, and a terrible troll."
3456,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little helpless
3457,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to leave her
3459,<|emo_fear|> A man died that day because he refused to stand and apologise for a century.
3460,<|emo_fear|> i was left feeling very frightened inside
3461,"<|emo_fear|> You didn't vote for [NAME], you did for [NAME]"
3463,<|emo_fear|> im feeling kind of weird
3464,<|emo_fear|> Oh my.
3465,<|emo_fear|> i feel weird and out there and a bit depressed but i know what i believe that what i should be is where i would be if i had the best support i could ever hope for
3466,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little vulnerable and unsure now
3467,<|emo_fear|> I hate the ones with shaky hands that are attached to the handle bars.
3468,<|emo_fear|> i have been feeling anxious a lot lately though
3470,"<|emo_fear|> When that head hits that body it is so heady, I really don’t like it"
3471,<|emo_fear|> This is creepy!
3473,"<|emo_fear|> The worst is when that information doesn't come in sooner, and it does."
3474,<|emo_fear|> This is me all the time and I’m really scared
3475,<|emo_fear|> i feel less afraid to approach people because i know how they feel and i know they are there for a reason
3476,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling skeptical after reading some of the comments on this blog that made me nervous
3477,<|emo_fear|> i could give away everything i owned and i feel devastated
3478,<|emo_fear|> The fact that most of them have apparently never been to a robbed bank is a real... oddity.
3479,<|emo_fear|> i started feeling afraid that i couldnt be a good dad
3480,<|emo_fear|> i got my car inspected and it is about 2/3 full of leaks

3482,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little afraid
3483,<|emo_fear|> i still feel a little skeptical of some of the theories
3485,<|emo_fear|> He said he heard [NAME] was in trouble and wondered what was wrong with him lol
3486,<|emo_fear|> i have a feeling he was afraid to speak out and probably wouldn t even be allowed to write if he did
3487,<|emo_fear|> i often feel isolated and alone in this world
3488,"<|emo_fear|> You mean, you don't trust anybody?"
3489,<|emo_fear|> i feel pressured and uncomfortable
3490,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling slightly skeptical about the whole thing
3491,<|emo_fear|> i didnt feel pressured to write anything
3492,<|emo_fear|> The saddest part is that she wants to be an actor instead.
3493,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little nervous and nervous about it as well
3494,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared when i see someone i know
3495,<|emo_fear|> I have an anxiety fear for my cat. He's terrified of all the chairs in the study.

3498,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared as i see it
3499,<|emo_fear|> i feel the strange pull too
3500,<|emo_fear|> i can feel the tortured soul of this tortured old person
3501,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little bit terrified to be around people like that because i used to be really sociable while living in the west
3502,<|emo_fear|> i started to feel doubtful
3503,<|emo_fear|> i have been feeling very hesitant about doing this on the advice of my mother who was very supportive of me doing it
3504,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid that i will run into a guy and i m not sure if i may have done wrong
3505,<|emo_fear|> She looks horrible.
3506,<|emo_fear|> I'm scared I might lose my job over these comments
3507,<|emo_fear|> i feel frightened with our current government
3508,<|emo_fear|> i remember feeling a little bit skeptical about wanting to go back to the place but eventually i started talking to some people back home who made me feel a little less skeptical
3509,<|emo_fear|> i always feel more terrified than i do when i am alone
3510,<|emo_fear|> i think when you feel doubtful and afraid
3511,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit weird writing this because i actually think it is fantastic

3516,<|emo_fear|> i didnt feel as paranoid but i was afraid to look into them

3519,<|emo_fear|> i actually feel slightly distressed
3520,<|emo_fear|> i feel very fearful now
3521,<|emo_fear|> This is pretty scary as it could very well be the start of a wider rise in fascism.

3537,<|emo_fear|> I have a very painful feeling that you're quite possibly the closest thing I have to a psychopath.
3538,<|emo_fear|> i started to find out what this place was really all about and soon grew disheartened with the whole thing
3539,<|emo_fear|> i started feeling a bit alarmed
3540,<|emo_fear|> i am a very shy person but i love doing things with people and this is one of the first times in my life that i am feeling nervous shy and shy is really a good thing because sometimes i just feel that people are intimidated
3541,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to tell them what s so interesting about it but i think they re glad to know all that s going on because they themselves are not in the room every evening
3542,<|emo_fear|> im on the verge of tears and just feeling horrible
3543,<|emo_fear|> i always feel intimidated
3544,<|emo_fear|> im feeling extremely uncomfortable right now

3549,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit stressed
3550,<|emo_fear|> i will tell you that ive been feeling very afraid and overwhelmed by the things ive read in news media about gary sronkowski

3552,<|emo_fear|> i could feel intimidated by that
3553,<|emo_fear|> i feel pretty nervous
3554,<|emo_fear|> i don t know how i feel about him because i feel so helpless for such things.
3555,"<|emo_fear|> He was too afraid to speak up, afraid he would lose his job, afraid his kids would be wronged, and afraid that his mom would face the wrath of the law. "
3556,<|emo_fear|> i didn t want to feel afraid again
3557,<|emo_fear|> i feel terrified and hopeless
3558,<|emo_fear|> When our dog has a bad experience I’ll be there crying and shaking
3559,"<|emo_fear|> Yeah. I wish, that I was wrong :("
3560,<|emo_fear|> i feel paranoid but thats pretty normal for me
3561,<|emo_fear|> This is the 2nd time I've heard of Redditors calling for the dead to beheaded.
3562,"<|emo_fear|> Yeah, imagine [NAME] running away from a psychopathic killer. Not that hard, I'd bet."
3563,<|emo_fear|> im going to feel apprehensive and anxious about the whole thing i can t wait to get that letter and when i see it
3564,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little hesitant to post this
3565,"<|emo_fear|> The fear is, that they will simply refuse or ask for another carpool."
3566,<|emo_fear|> You're probably right and the CCP sucks for not doing anything about it.
3567,<|emo_fear|> i didnt feel frightened but intimidated by the many steps they had taken in my home and everywhere
3568,<|emo_fear|> That's not true at all. I've never even heard of people who think that is a terrible thing to do.
3569,"<|emo_fear|> There also seems to be some suggestion that this is some sort of “paid coyote” scam, which I fear is quite real."
3570,<|emo_fear|> I am scared for my life
3571,<|emo_fear|> I’m thinking the same...heart breaking...
3572,<|emo_fear|> We don’t do penis in japanese sex is weird
3573,<|emo_fear|> How horrifying. He could save lives. CPR is non existent unless the hospital has a staffed office. It's like we live inocentric times.
3574,<|emo_fear|> He has a very interesting and somewhat frighteningly realistic voice.

3579,"<|emo_fear|> [NAME], your age difference is incredibly creepy."
3580,<|emo_fear|> i feel very shaky
3581,<|emo_fear|> That [NAME] was an absolute monster. Always under the influence of a lot of things you can't quite put your finger on and a few you definitely can't really put a finger on.
3582,<|emo_fear|> i get the feeling he is afraid that ive disturbed himself because his mind s busy with something else
3583,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit doubtful
3584,<|emo_fear|> That’s so scary to think about.
3585,<|emo_fear|> i feel like i have a paranoid partner
3586,<|emo_fear|> It’s kinda creepy.
3587,<|emo_fear|> Oh my gosh! How did [NAME] get let back into the team roster?
3588,<|emo_fear|> i feel confused and uncertain my heart is heavy
3589,<|emo_fear|> i began to feel unsure of my footing
3590,<|emo_fear|> i often feel pressured to write when im feeling too indecisive

3593,<|emo_fear|> I'm scared for this baby.
3594,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling afraid and somewhat indecisive about the matter
3596,"<|emo_fear|> We had a mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, CO. The shooter was Devin Patrick. I think this is the first time a mass shooting has wounded this many. "

3598,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure of
3600,<|emo_fear|> When they tried to kill me with a bat and I felt the impact
3601,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless and like i have no control
3602,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling nervous and nervous and anxious with every step we take
3603,<|emo_fear|> You're saying I'm anti-intellectual
3604,<|emo_fear|> i feel nervous going into the first day of my new job
3605,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling uncertain and anxious
3606,<|emo_fear|> i still feel anxious and restless and tired
3607,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little bit apprehensive and nervous
3608,"<|emo_fear|> I've seen photos of dog bites, this is horrible."
3609,"<|emo_fear|> That's weird I wasn't expecting it to show up, glad my brain was wrong though. "
3610,<|emo_fear|> im feeling more helpless and helpless than i feel
3611,<|emo_fear|> I want to die
3613,<|emo_fear|> i had a feeling im going to be a bit shaky and nervous coming out of that
3614,<|emo_fear|> i feel apprehensive and scared
3615,<|emo_fear|> i started feeling nervous i had just made a video of my terrifying first trip through some particularly active forests and was back home to reindeer country
3616,<|emo_fear|> i think that in those moments where i dont know or don t feel safe
3617,<|emo_fear|> Omg lmao stop.
3618,"<|emo_fear|> I am a little scared of the deep blue sea, as it seems as if there is an abyss dwelling high in the bowels of the earth."
3619,<|emo_fear|> i really feel so helpless
3620,<|emo_fear|> i feel like an apprehensive child afraid to move
3621,<|emo_fear|> i feel like i have this terrible fear of not being able to remember anything or not being able to look my mouth into a place where im speaking for two minutes on the radio at that hour of the night
3622,<|emo_fear|> It's hard to hold in a hug when your heart is churning
3623,<|emo_fear|> i do feel fearful so i try and say i dont want to be that person for the rest of my life
3624,"<|emo_fear|> You can't run away from who you are no matter how hard you try, you can only pretend to be who you are and pretend to be okay."
3625,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very vulnerable and insecure around everyone especially my besties
3626,<|emo_fear|> i honestly feel quite apprehensive to leave
3627,<|emo_fear|> i do feel terrified
3628,<|emo_fear|> It could be worse! An Pandemic has already devastated parts of cities!
3629,<|emo_fear|> i feel weird with him around because the last thing i want is a weirdo
3630,<|emo_fear|> i would feel even more unsure and insecure
3631,"<|emo_fear|> Ooh, and it’s a terrible idea to have that high of a ceiling. It just doesn’t work. "
3632,<|emo_fear|> I just could not bring myself to get on board with it. I hated the Allianz pitch last year too.
3633,<|emo_fear|> This just makes me feel inadequate physically and mentally :/
3634,<|emo_fear|> >[NAME] is a paranoid hillbilly The paranoid hillbilly paranoia is pretty worrying.
3635,<|emo_fear|> i feel so nervous as i wait for word from my school doctor
3637,<|emo_fear|> i am sure i will feel some pressure to keep me in line but at the moment i feel as if i must let go
3638,<|emo_fear|> i feel overwhelmed and stressed out
3639,<|emo_fear|> i start to feel weird and wonder if i am a monster and should i be afraid to live
3640,<|emo_fear|> Your fear of needles is probably much greater.
3641,<|emo_fear|> i feel as if im just sitting here in a weird state of confusion and hope
3642,<|emo_fear|> the horror!
3643,<|emo_fear|> Oh [NAME] there were some people in the comments of that video that seemed very angry
3644,<|emo_fear|> [NAME]! He never lets you down! I’m so sorry you’re going through this!
3645,<|emo_fear|> That's so scary. I really hope you and that girl are ok.
3646,<|emo_fear|> I miss the north hills bottom dollar so much
3647,<|emo_fear|> i thought i would feel more insecure about life
3648,<|emo_fear|> i feel so anxious about this one
3649,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared and anxious
3650,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very apprehensive and uncertain about my future
3651,<|emo_fear|> The worst is working with dealerships
3652,<|emo_fear|> A lot Of The Best music was made by people in bands that got together and played shows in cities that were small
3653,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant to give it up as its a valuable experience and a way of exploring a different set of thoughts on how to move forward in post secondary science
3654,<|emo_fear|> Who cares? It's not like they could've done it earlier.
3655,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared and frustrated by a lot of things
3656,<|emo_fear|> i feel terrified waiting for anything to happen
3658,<|emo_fear|> That’s my nightmare. The US is great at this. If they want us to have free care they need to improve.
3659,<|emo_fear|> i can just tell you that feeling terrified and helpless is something i know that i will never experience when it comes to running a family
3660,<|emo_fear|> Omg that's horrible
3661,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid because i dont know
3662,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling very fearful and doubtful of my life recently
3663,<|emo_fear|> i cant help but to feel terrified of losing everything
3664,<|emo_fear|> i feel doubtful about my abilities and experience
3665,"<|emo_fear|> We know it isn't just the sky that is black, but also the ground? I’m wondering if that’s what is going on?"
3666,<|emo_fear|> They were all afraid of [NAME]
3667,<|emo_fear|> Yeah. The last thing I want is another [NAME] situation
3668,<|emo_fear|> i have been feeling overwhelmed by work
3669,<|emo_fear|> i think im being scared here by the amount of time spent so ill just post it as such a long and difficult post
3670,<|emo_fear|> That’s the reason why [NAME] is such a fucking monster: for him to constantly double dip into his own personal deep pockets and then hide the difference between the two amounts.
3671,<|emo_fear|> I honestly don’t know why they let him on the team. Wasn’t terrible at all.
3672,<|emo_fear|> the most horrifying nightmare
3673,<|emo_fear|> i guess hes in shock that he feels i am a monster for doing what he thinks should be the right thing then he finally breaks up with me so he can get his feelings out and leave me
3674,<|emo_fear|> i feel skeptical of her story
3675,<|emo_fear|> The monster! Is real!
3676,<|emo_fear|> i feel apprehensive to go out
3677,<|emo_fear|> i do feel slightly shaken up but i dont think this is enough for me
3678,<|emo_fear|> You're disgusting.
3679,<|emo_fear|> That's even scarier!
3680,<|emo_fear|> I've heard before that if I was to die right now I'd probably have one hell of a wake up call <3
3681,<|emo_fear|> The most horrible thing they could ever imagine
3682,<|emo_fear|> And they say you can't judge a book by its cover
3683,<|emo_fear|> i didnt feel scared at all that i wasnt going to die
3684,<|emo_fear|> > I am one weirded out [NAME]
3685,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling pretty reluctant and hesitant and reluctant because of what i had done
3686,"<|emo_fear|> She is still a terrifying woman, but it looks so much better."
3687,"<|emo_fear|> So you're gay. No deal, scum!"
3688,"<|emo_fear|> Just another day, another injury report that already has us wondering if coach's talk is real or not, and yet another guy (?) who just looks terrible."
3689,<|emo_fear|> And they say stories are written to scare
3690,<|emo_fear|> i began to feel so helpless when i had no idea what was wrong
3691,<|emo_fear|> i have some questions about why i feel the way i do about the god s name
3692,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid of not knowing where i am and the things that life throws my way
3693,<|emo_fear|> i can't feel safe
3694,<|emo_fear|> im actually feeling afraid this is tomorrow s class
3695,<|emo_fear|> They're scared
3696,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel as nervous
3698,<|emo_fear|> I just can't get behind what she said. For some reason I feel really strongly about supporting women in science but I worry that [NAME] is a pushover.
3699,<|emo_fear|> i feel very worried that this might happen
3700,<|emo_fear|> i cant bring myself to feel scared
3701,<|emo_fear|> i feel nervous just sitting down to write because this is not the kind of job i want to do
3702,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel as scared when i know that my friend is safe but i wonder when my own worst enemy might be lurking
3703,<|emo_fear|> i feel vulnerable and uncertain and even dangerous
3704,<|emo_fear|> i feel frightened i hope someone picks me up from the hospital tomorrow morning
3706,<|emo_fear|> i feel terrified of it
3707,<|emo_fear|> i feel like i must be afraid
3708,<|emo_fear|> im feeling pretty apprehensive for this one
3709,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure and nervous
3710,<|emo_fear|> i feel frightened afraid and hopeless often
3711,<|emo_fear|> He might actually start to fall down :(
3712,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling terrified
3713,<|emo_fear|> That was one Hell of a hookup
3714,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling nervous about his reaction
3715,"<|emo_fear|> That is what scares me the most. A lot of people worry about similar things, but I'm worried about how that would spread."
3716,<|emo_fear|> i always feel afraid about that because i think i already know what he is afraid of
3717,<|emo_fear|> Your character is so sad.
3718,"<|emo_fear|> A month ago, I said you could get sick on hot Take 2. That has changed a ton since then."
3720,<|emo_fear|> i feel that i need to be much more careful about the things that i do and how i tell others about them
3721,<|emo_fear|> i do know is that when someone leaves a compliment and a piece of advice in the works forever or ever a feeling of shame comes flooding back
3722,<|emo_fear|> when i got a call from family planning saying my boyfriend was interested in getting me taken to a hospital
3723,<|emo_fear|> I'm scared for y’all saying you “don't understand ” about the [NAME] situation :'(
3726,<|emo_fear|> i remember feeling so unsure and scared
3727,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to tell anyone yet youd be wondering why i keep silent no one ever thought i was the most likely to say it but no one is a stranger and its not like the other person is really a stranger and i'm not all that concerned
3728,<|emo_fear|> Just stop!
3729,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a bit strange about these pictures
3730,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling anxious and just had a really bad case of the giggles which is all
3731,<|emo_fear|> Oh no no no no no
3732,<|emo_fear|> i know i am not alone when i say that i feel scared every time i see your picture
3733,<|emo_fear|> im sure that you all feel apprehensive about the future of horror as i see it a lot of folks are still terrified of new horror being created in horror again
3734,<|emo_fear|> It's a weird thing that happens to a lot of men.
3735,<|emo_fear|> i was more feeling hesitant about going
3736,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very anxious
3737,<|emo_fear|> This is not that bad of a list.
3738,<|emo_fear|> i think i was feeling reluctant to write a review since it wasnt the best film i could have judged
3739,<|emo_fear|> i feel intimidated and i am more reluctant to leave feeling this way
3740,<|emo_fear|> i could feel your breath on my neck and i was afraid he would feel frightened
3741,<|emo_fear|> i started doing some investigation on this matter and have come to the conclusion that it d be extremely dangerous for me to try to keep myself from doing any investigation into this matter
3742,<|emo_fear|> I can't believe [NAME] is in the mix. Never would have thought we'd get O-line help at this spot.
3743,<|emo_fear|> I've tried it with different people and it's terrible. My gut says no.
3744,<|emo_fear|> i have a feeling about something in here somehow im keeping my thoughts shut
3745,<|emo_fear|> This is scary. I tried calling back but they said they couldn't help. I think this is still a Mexico- Canada border situation.
3746,<|emo_fear|> the sad part is that its almost impossible to find these on amazon and i feel personally attacked.
3747,<|emo_fear|> i feel apprehensive
3748,<|emo_fear|> What a horrendous list
3749,<|emo_fear|> I’m not crying. You’re crying!
3750,<|emo_fear|> ive had several friends drop me off at home for one of the easier days of the week and i still feel really vulnerable
3751,<|emo_fear|> When things were really bad back in the day it was with heavy load- bearing wheels.
3752,<|emo_fear|> He is a pretty dangerous man
3753,<|emo_fear|> im feeling slightly intimidated
3754,<|emo_fear|> My worst fear is catching a cold
3755,<|emo_fear|> I want so bad to be like them!
3756,<|emo_fear|> This is why people hate on reddit.
3758,<|emo_fear|> i know i m giving off this vibe but i feel reluctant at the moment to tell him anything
3759,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared when im in a dangerous place
3760,<|emo_fear|> i feel very nervous being around him all the time
3761,<|emo_fear|> i know is that because i feel afraid and overwhelmed i have decided to step away from the internet and into the safe arms of someone who can offer me help
3762,<|emo_fear|> im feeling extremely anxious about it all
3763,<|emo_fear|> I am going to have to cut this off and put it into the garbage if it continues
3764,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little bit uncertain about what i will study next
3765,"<|emo_fear|> What you are doing is child abuse, plain and simple. Get the help you need. "
3766,<|emo_fear|> i can feel that she is afraid of what she needs to be but she is being a truthful mom
3767,<|emo_fear|> I had a panic attack!
3768,"<|emo_fear|> It’s a vicious circle. All the things I did to deserve it, I still do thanks."
3769,"<|emo_fear|> Yeah, I heard that the reason for it being terrible is people afraid of being found out. "
3770,<|emo_fear|> i went down the walkway feeling more nervous than anything
3771,<|emo_fear|> i feel apprehensive and unsure at the same time
3772,<|emo_fear|> My daughter had a very similar experience two years ago. She has since changed her whole approach to walking and is now totally terrified of running in the rain and snow.
3773,<|emo_fear|> That’s terrifying
3774,<|emo_fear|> Oh no! What's the horrible news for you?!
3775,<|emo_fear|> i cant help but feel that im uncertain of the directions the story is going in
3776,<|emo_fear|> i feel overwhelmed and need your help
3777,<|emo_fear|> i feel this odd sort of anxiety in that i feel that when something truly terrifying happens at a place where i feel absolute safety my life will be completely different
3778,<|emo_fear|> im not feeling very fearful
3780,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very anxious and anxious to get back to work
3781,<|emo_fear|> Oh my [NAME] stop
3782,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little strange about it
3783,<|emo_fear|> i have to admit i am feeling a little nervous
3784,<|emo_fear|> im feeling less paranoid and more trusting and grateful for even a moment of peace i have
3785,<|emo_fear|> i feel so helpless but i know the fear monsignor will do anything to make me think im being crazy
3786,<|emo_fear|> i don t know what is it that keeps me from loving you
3787,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling a little reluctant on the part of all of us to go and do something but also because i don t want to put much miles on there and make a career out of it
3788,<|emo_fear|> i have felt a bit less terrified
3789,<|emo_fear|> oh no
3792,<|emo_fear|> i feel shy knowing that i m watching
3793,<|emo_fear|> i can feel that the most precious things its damaged
3794,<|emo_fear|> i feel fearful anxious about him
3795,"<|emo_fear|> It's a weird thing people do. They'll say something like, 'I just noticed your picture on there so I decided to check it out'"
3796,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling a little unsure what to do with the book
3797,<|emo_fear|> i got off that phone feeling this really weird feeling of trust which is shaken to the core but at the same time i was scared that i was vulnerable because my fears had been realised
3798,<|emo_fear|> i feel uncertain and alone
3799,<|emo_fear|> i felt like an insecure little girl
3800,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to post because of the uncertain future that we live in but im sure you can imagine the pain that it will create for us all
3801,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared and lonely so much that i am no longer dating
3802,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless and helpless to stop something
3803,<|emo_fear|> Holy heckin heck
3804,<|emo_fear|> i wouldnt be surprised if the parents thought i was crazy
3805,<|emo_fear|> i feel skeptical about this claim
3806,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless and out of control
3807,<|emo_fear|> i feel so scared to let people in the house ever again
3808,<|emo_fear|> What a weird thing for an ex partner to say.
3809,<|emo_fear|> You don't have to be afraid of the dark to see the wonders and wonders that lie in your future. Stay strong!
3810,"<|emo_fear|> It's extremely disheartening. People always seem to say they loved me at some point, then 6 months later they hate me because of something I said. "
3811,<|emo_fear|> The problem with crowd snares is that it's much easier to aim them while moving
3813,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling nervous and fearful of things that i might lose someone that i love dearly
3814,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very indecisive about what im going to do now
3816,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im being tortured
3817,<|emo_fear|> > It's still a weird thing people do I've never felt it before
3818,<|emo_fear|> Well you're still horrible.
3819,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling nervous and anxious and scared
3820,"<|emo_fear|> Not really cringe, just sad."
3821,<|emo_fear|> I remember being 3-4 years old and having to hide in my room because of the banging from our floor.
3822,<|emo_fear|> i could just go around and take pictures of the area and write down where she was every time she went out i never feel nervous to approach the area
3823,<|emo_fear|> i also had terrible breathing so i remember feeling very apprehensive and excited
3824,<|emo_fear|> Lol why didn’t people notice that? It’s almost as if they’re embarrassed for you.
3825,<|emo_fear|> I'm scared I might lose it All the time
3827,<|emo_fear|> I'm kinda afraid I'll be making this joke a lot and then I'll get sad because I'm making that joke.
3829,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little hesitant
3830,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to share what i have found out and about today
3831,<|emo_fear|> A video showing this kind of brutality is extremely worrying. to deteriorate the quality any further
3832,"<|emo_fear|> I know, I know, but I also know I have a long list of potential terrible things to say about my boyfriend"
3833,<|emo_fear|> i feel skeptical and hesitant
3835,<|emo_fear|> It's terrifying.
3836,<|emo_fear|> I’m scared but also excited because I’m scared that I’m doing exactly the exact same thing
3837,<|emo_fear|> > What the fuck? They look like THEY’RE HAIRY AND HAIRY BEHIND Their faces 🤮🤮😂
3838,<|emo_fear|> I got a little frightened just reading that. I hope the monster is more evil than what was initially described...
3839,<|emo_fear|> i feel very hesitant to go back
3840,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] was terrible in that game. I'm so sad he's not here.
3841,"<|emo_fear|> The worst is actually just a marketing campaign for Undercrown, their upcoming IP."
3842,<|emo_fear|> the color of it is really creepy
3843,<|emo_fear|> You're right. But you're also wrong as a whole. People fear for their lives and are very open about it.
3844,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a bit apprehensive about it all
3845,<|emo_fear|> The fact that [NAME] was able to get his arms out of those positions before his accident is pretty scary.
3847,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling fearful and shaky
3848,<|emo_fear|> when a car driver ploughed into aped a festive children's Christmas in north west london
3851,<|emo_fear|> i do do feel kind of weird about being a goth
3852,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless afraid
3853,<|emo_fear|> i feel very nervous
3854,<|emo_fear|> A few months ago I would have said that was a good look but now I'm leaning towards [NAME] instead
3855,<|emo_fear|> i am going to start to feel apprehensive as i have yet to see any real footage from julie which i know is going to change my view of the sport and the sport in general
3856,"<|emo_fear|> It'll ruin you one day, won't it?"
3857,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to tell you all to be careful about the names and places you visit
3858,<|emo_fear|> i feel uncomfortable while holding a camera
3859,<|emo_fear|> im feeling shaken up
3860,<|emo_fear|> i just feel shy and i dont want to lose the connection to her
3861,<|emo_fear|> i feel shy to be around others
3862,<|emo_fear|> im feeling pretty fearful right now too
3863,<|emo_fear|> im feeling nervous and just unsure
3864,"<|emo_fear|> The sad thing is, it would probably get worse."
3865,<|emo_fear|> im feeling pretty uncertain and a little skeptical about the whole thing
3866,<|emo_fear|> i feel so helpless to stop the harassment
3867,<|emo_fear|> That’s so scary. I fear the same thing.
3868,<|emo_fear|> i feel so apprehensive about going out with guys
3869,<|emo_fear|> He was only given 2 Superpowers and if he lost both this is absolutely terrifying
3870,<|emo_fear|> I’m really worried. Her picture is really haunting
3871,<|emo_fear|> It's so horrifying. And yet I still defend him. Because he's fighting for our freedom. [NAME] = [NAME]
3872,<|emo_fear|> i always feel intimidated about being with other girls but thats why im here and if your in a school of girls where youre the only girl you have to feel scared about and im just gonna ask for your phone number
3873,<|emo_fear|> I'm 6'1 and I'm afraid to weigh myself.
3874,<|emo_fear|> Oh no! The poor man was a meat tenderizer!
3876,<|emo_fear|> i did not feel fearful
3877,<|emo_fear|> i feel like ive been kind of a blank
3879,<|emo_fear|> im feeling afraid
3880,"<|emo_fear|> I went to sleep a couple hours ago after coming home from work, what the hell is this all about?"
3881,<|emo_fear|> i began to feel less afraid and more herself before i walked into the room
3882,<|emo_fear|> i feel skeptical and uncertain
3883,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] i feel is a worse threat than [NAME]. [NAME] also has the ability to kill multiple people at once without much warning. [NAME] is just a worse saber afraid to use it tho
3884,<|emo_fear|> I can't imagine being that retired 😂
3885,<|emo_fear|> i feel so frightened but i can only imagine how much pain and suffering went into writing this
3887,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] just needs one win to go from terrible to awesome
3888,<|emo_fear|> i will always remain true to myself but the feeling is very strange because im not sure why
3889,<|emo_fear|> You were shot at point blank range twice.
3890,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling agitated for no apparent reason
3891,"<|emo_fear|> It's a weird thing to feel, I suppose. Maybe anxiety?"
3892,<|emo_fear|> oh no!!!!
3893,<|emo_fear|> im feeling uncertain about everything because the past couple years i have only been feeling better
3895,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling paranoid and feeling stressed a lot so i didn t particularly look in much further than my own room
3896,<|emo_fear|> i can feel the shaky bottom of my water and the feeling that i have no control of my life
3897,<|emo_fear|> i dont want to give too much away i already feel too shaken up right now
3899,<|emo_fear|> Thats absolutely terrifying.
3900,<|emo_fear|> i don t know how to tell the difference between a fake and an actual hug
3901,<|emo_fear|> i feel terrified at the thought of what my children are learning
3902,<|emo_fear|> It was so horrifying... I think I just closed my eyes for a second or so... I was so freaking terrified
3903,<|emo_fear|> I remember when I watched it [NAME]: I thought you were really creepy
3904,<|emo_fear|> I think he accidentally shot himself in the hand
3905,<|emo_fear|> im feeling kinda hesitant about this one
3906,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling terrified i just need a friend
3907,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling somewhat overwhelmed lately
3908,"<|emo_fear|> Oh, my gosh!! You beat me to this comment... thanks everyone!! "
3909,<|emo_fear|> i really feel terrified of seeing another person suffer
3910,<|emo_fear|> >I'll add that I'm not an [NAME] but I'll still call the police if he does.
3911,<|emo_fear|> i went home feeling a little shaky and then a little windy
3912,<|emo_fear|> Your character is so terrifying...
3913,<|emo_fear|> I just get scared thinking about it
3914,<|emo_fear|> Lol I'm sure is just because you don't like the look of it and want its terrible. 
3915,<|emo_fear|> i thought i would probably end up feeling pretty shaky
3916,<|emo_fear|> i feel very unsure of my future
3917,<|emo_fear|> She is not normal at all.
3918,"<|emo_fear|> No. They are all terrible. But, to say that all are terrible is just ignorant."
3919,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid to leave my house
3920,<|emo_fear|> i feel more scared now
3921,<|emo_fear|> i can feel very apprehensive as i have never done anything much like this and it s very dark even in the town lights
3922,<|emo_fear|> im feeling skeptical about these numbers
3923,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling worried
3924,<|emo_fear|> im looking forward to going back and feeling the fears and apprehensions but im also excited to feel fearless
3926,<|emo_fear|> Is anyone going to post a picture of it (sorry)
3927,<|emo_fear|> This guy is creepy
3928,<|emo_fear|> This gives me anxiety every time
3929,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling apprehensive about this time around because we were in for an eventful summer which would probably have had a different outcome for me
3930,<|emo_fear|> i feel pretty weird saying something like that to him since hes always been a little hesitant to say his feelings.
3931,<|emo_fear|> She is a danger to herself and others
3932,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling very insecure
3934,<|emo_fear|> i feel very intimidated just thinking about this
3935,<|emo_fear|> im feeling paranoid already
3936,<|emo_fear|> Because it's horrifying.
3939,<|emo_fear|> i do this i feel a little weird
3940,<|emo_fear|> i feel uncomfortable when he talks about men feeling shy about his own penis
3941,<|emo_fear|> Oh no! Poor daddys little girl!
3942,<|emo_fear|> i have a feeling i ve been shaken to the core
3943,<|emo_fear|> i feel uncertain and not anxious or happy at all
3944,<|emo_fear|> of fear
3945,<|emo_fear|> I think she might be afraid he'll find out too. He won’t tell his Mom.
3946,<|emo_fear|> This is the saddest account that I've seen on this sub
3947,<|emo_fear|> i see so many times it feels like im almost a person to him most of the time and a little less in the moment
3948,<|emo_fear|> i feel skeptical of the claims of many local government workers and i wonder if this city is seriously lacking in support for those who need it most
3949,<|emo_fear|> I was creeped out by that face.
3950,<|emo_fear|> Oh I know just bantz
3951,<|emo_fear|> The sad part of this is how perfectly realised this is
3952,<|emo_fear|> ive been talking to a lot of people but i am feeling pretty fearful
3953,<|emo_fear|> i find myself feeling quite uncertain about my relationship to the world
3954,<|emo_fear|> I’m afraid you’re going to lose your job over this
3955,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling all shaky lately im afraid
3956,<|emo_fear|> i thought about how it all started with us leaving for the country i feel like some kind of strange attraction to the place
3957,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little apprehensive about it all
3958,"<|emo_fear|> Damn, that was dirty."
3959,<|emo_fear|> i feel fearful and uncertain
3960,<|emo_fear|> i also feel skeptical around a lot of people
3961,<|emo_fear|> i feel extremely nervous watching it
3962,<|emo_fear|> She was horrible
3963,<|emo_fear|> i really don t like people who use logic or reason but when i think of how it can make me feel i wonder if the thing is still there
3964,<|emo_fear|> Your a horrible person.
3965,<|emo_fear|> Just so scary.
3966,<|emo_fear|> i feel pretty threatened
3967,<|emo_fear|> I'm so tired lol
3968,"<|emo_fear|> No, we're getting back to the ways things started out and getting those expectations met."
3969,"<|emo_fear|> The weird thing is that most of them are decent. It also seems like the majority of them work outside the home, but the work is usually jobs where the safety is a concern. "
3970,<|emo_fear|> i feel so helpless i can t stop my heart
3971,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling kinda frantic
3972,<|emo_fear|> this video makes me feel like screaming
3974,"<|emo_fear|> Just remember I love you. There's no way around it, it's beyond compassionate help."
3975,<|emo_fear|> im feeling pretty paranoid
3976,<|emo_fear|> i feel weird about not going
3977,<|emo_fear|> oh [NAME] its horrible
3978,<|emo_fear|> I'm scared for her. He could easily turn that video into a sting video
3979,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling anxious i said no one was going to come around to my room at night
3980,<|emo_fear|> i woke up feeling pretty strange
3981,<|emo_fear|> im feeling slightly skeptical about this one
3982,"<|emo_fear|> I feel you mate: ""Mate, there are no femalevolent spirits in this place, just humans just trying to keep it cool."" "
3983,<|emo_fear|> i thought to myself feeling less afraid to question
3984,<|emo_fear|> i would probably try it first with two to three people at first because i think that the most vulnerable people feel the most assaulted by these things and they are the perfect weapons
3985,<|emo_fear|> I'm scared I might get winded doing that.
3986,<|emo_fear|> The [NAME] of horror!
3987,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little bit anxious
3988,<|emo_fear|> i have found that i need to take a moment during the day and to stop feeling anxious and to truly allow myself to embrace my feelings
3989,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] are horrible for business and politics.
3991,<|emo_fear|> That's just sad.
3992,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little nervous and a little unsure i mean im not old yet but ive been a year or so in the game and i think it just means im young to start thinking about this stuff
3993,<|emo_fear|> I'm scared we might trade him before the deadline
3994,<|emo_fear|> i will not describe all of the details of my own relationship with my mother but rather make an attempt at a general account of how she had effect on my life and how she has affected my understanding of self control and the ability to trust
3995,<|emo_fear|> i feel so unsure sometimes but at the same time im so determined to try to go for the big time
3996,<|emo_fear|> That’s sick.
3997,"<|emo_fear|> I am thinking of the episode of True Blood called How to Get a Gun. It doesn't make this list for the same reason it did for me, but I still envy [NAME]."
3998,"<|emo_fear|> She did say some amazing things though, I'm just hesitant to read too much into them."
3999,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] has the most fear [NAME] would have.
4000,<|emo_fear|> im feeling apprehensive for a few reasons
4002,<|emo_fear|> i started to feel weird about myself
4003,<|emo_fear|> i feel so helpless when the need for support suddenly presents itself
4004,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little hesitant in trusting this man again
4005,<|emo_fear|> i started feeling reluctant
4006,<|emo_fear|> So much fear m8
4008,<|emo_fear|> You can't pick and choose racism (anyone know how many young black men and women are killed by racism). It always results in more hate.
4009,<|emo_fear|> i have been feeling extremely nervous
4010,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid i have no control over this
4011,<|emo_fear|> When it came out I hated it. My parents were very supportive so it was alright.
4012,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling overwhelmed and overwhelmed by all the little issues and what not that keeps me from my goals
4013,<|emo_fear|> Your character is so cool because you're a [NAME]. But you're just a [NAME] in disguise.
4014,<|emo_fear|> My mom was out for a walk that startedle her so much. She couldn’t get out of her chair because her back was against the wall so she went back to work.
4015,<|emo_fear|> i feel terrified to go
4016,<|emo_fear|> i do know is that if i m alone and feeling a bit scared i might start thinking of others as a prey
4017,<|emo_fear|> It really depends on the story though. Some people are afraid to talk to the press because they fear Forcibly Sending them to prison.
4018,<|emo_fear|> But it'll hurt
4019,"<|emo_fear|> I’m sorry because I totally like your joke. But yes, he has childhood cancer."
4020,<|emo_fear|> i was left feeling more and more uncertain than i had already been
4021,<|emo_fear|> i feel like a scared little girl
4022,"<|emo_fear|> of course, I didn't find that surprising though."
4023,<|emo_fear|> i was doing a lot of reading and now that i have finished a series of books i feel a little dazed and disoriented
4024,<|emo_fear|> I mean I don’t like her but she seems really cool in the 2nd episode.
4025,<|emo_fear|> i have been feeling skeptical and skeptical is that i havent yet been given any support in how i am being treated
4026,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid to have ever been this afraid of anything before
4027,<|emo_fear|> im still feeling overwhelmed and anxious
4028,<|emo_fear|> i must say that i have not tried this and i know why and i do not really believe i would be this afraid to use another hair spray in the area but if i did then i would realize its the least worst of options
4029,"<|emo_fear|> No, I was actually just gonna say this, the lack of diversity in the video game community is really scary "
4032,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless because all i can think of is this
4033,<|emo_fear|> im feeling uncertain and scared i am loving those moments
4034,<|emo_fear|> I think it's actually worse honestly. Because it's so common for single parents to neglect their responsibilities.
4035,<|emo_fear|> You're a terrible person and a terrible person only makes you even worse. Sad.
4036,<|emo_fear|> i feel very insecure and anxious and scared and some of my friends tell me i will not be with them forever
4037,<|emo_fear|> i also just feel weird calling her a teacher because i really don t feel like i need to tell her in any way im not on her best behavior
4038,<|emo_fear|> I'm also afraid the same thing will happen to me at age 30.
4039,<|emo_fear|> ive done many odd things and was really nervous because in these strange times of emergency medicine i feel like i have far more responsibility then i do
4040,<|emo_fear|> How is that not child abuse. It is sad that a few are so large.
4042,<|emo_fear|> im feeling vulnerable yet terrified around all of you
4043,<|emo_fear|> It would be so awful if we had any serious competition.
4044,<|emo_fear|> i feel terrified and alone
4045,<|emo_fear|> i cant help but feel a little intimidated
4046,"<|emo_fear|> ""We'll do our best"" is an awful mantra to follow."
4047,<|emo_fear|> i didnt feel like im being too careful with the writing it got a little gloomy at times
4048,"<|emo_fear|> There is a very real and frighteningly high rate of mental health problems among asylum seekers, including high rates of suicide. They are, in short, a strain on the criminal justice system."
4049,<|emo_fear|> ive also heard that this feeling of hopelessness can sometimes be a useful tool in dealing with other kinds of frustration
4050,"<|emo_fear|> Damnit, I was wondering what that was!"
4051,<|emo_fear|> i really feel threatened and afraid of what is going to happen in the next few weeks
4052,"<|emo_fear|> I believe this is another example of a scam, similar to ones you are seeing on here."
4053,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling afraid and helpless i can t believe i have to tell this it all
4054,<|emo_fear|> im feeling more vulnerable than ever
4055,<|emo_fear|> i am just feeling insecure about it
4056,<|emo_fear|> im feeling so uncertain about who i am when i look at a picture of myself these last few days
4057,<|emo_fear|> i was sitting down eating lunch and i felt so nervous
4058,<|emo_fear|> He is a moron.
4059,<|emo_fear|> i feel so overwhelmed all the time with my desire for our blessed blessed daughter s sake we share and our blessed son s sake she seems to think im being selfish
4060,<|emo_fear|> Well I mean since the beginning of the season it feels like they need this season to really get it and it was pretty unexpected even at 13.
4061,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling so apprehensive and unsure about the future and things in my home town of china
4062,<|emo_fear|> I was about to say the same
4063,<|emo_fear|> i said i would be feeling very pressured when it came time to write on it
4064,<|emo_fear|> i did not feel nervous at all
4065,<|emo_fear|> If the man had a gun it would be the.45 ACP one. Which would be far worse for the environment because it's likely the ammo is steel.
4066,<|emo_fear|> i had seen a woman and a man going about their day happily but for whatever reason didnt feel comfortable with me
4067,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] is scary. Is there anything we can do?
4068,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very intimidated by all of this
4069,<|emo_fear|> i feel like he could not come to terms with the abuse of his ex or feel that he should face consequences
4070,<|emo_fear|> i get scared about going to a party that has the guests who are underage and i can t handle it
4071,<|emo_fear|> im feeling nervous and anxious
4072,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling a little bit fearful all the time this morning
4073,<|emo_fear|> That’s a horrible take. Was it in the game?
4074,<|emo_fear|> i feel more and more uncertain
4075,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling less than impressed with the quality of the pictures that she took for her business
4076,<|emo_fear|> i didnt know that i should feel excited about my new found freedom
4077,"<|emo_fear|> >it's a very dangerous thing to do, as seen with [NAME] and [NAME] "
4078,<|emo_fear|> i feel very uncertain of my place as an adult
4079,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling a little bit reluctant to get out of bed but im definitely making a list
4080,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to continue reading
4081,"<|emo_fear|> My god, she lost 30lbs at 18!"
4082,"<|emo_fear|> The thing that frightened me most about this, aside from the fact that it's such a recent development, is the lack of any form of media to report on this. Only news shorts"
4083,<|emo_fear|> i was still feeling fearful of the cold
4084,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless to stop them
4085,<|emo_fear|> i feel this strange calm coming on but im hesitant because i know im just making things too dangerous
4086,<|emo_fear|> i can feel that im being pressured too hard a lot of the time
4087,<|emo_fear|> This is scary. [NAME] and [NAME] have always wanted kids so it all came out in the end lol
4088,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling vulnerable lately
4089,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling apprehensive and anxious
4090,<|emo_fear|> This is so infuriating. :(
4091,<|emo_fear|> This happened to me last week at work
4092,<|emo_fear|> > [NAME] I just can't see it Love you man
4093,<|emo_fear|> i cannot feel so distraught
4094,<|emo_fear|> This is painful
4095,<|emo_fear|> i feel anxious again
4096,<|emo_fear|> i always feel pressured to become a person of higher social standing by people who are far above me
4097,<|emo_fear|> i actually feel quite apprehensive
4098,<|emo_fear|> im so excited that youre here i think youre going to feel quite distressed over the whole experience
4099,<|emo_fear|> i think it happened but i did feel a little apprehensive on sunday morning because i thought it might get difficult
4100,<|emo_fear|> i feel very scared right now
4101,"<|emo_fear|> That must have been terrifying. It's uncertain if he was being intentionally harmful, but that's a new fear for me."
4102,<|emo_fear|> I'm scared for the kid.
4103,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little frightened too
4105,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid im going to screw it up so it looks more terrifying than it actually is
4106,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant to sell
4107,<|emo_fear|> i would have been more hesitant to let her go
4108,<|emo_fear|> That day was certainly frightening.
4109,<|emo_fear|> im really feeling a little hesitant
4110,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling kinda shaken up
4111,<|emo_fear|> i dont know to what point that could be considered a fault it just feels like the natural disaster that people expect the most from the government
4114,<|emo_fear|> i feel skeptical about this report
4115,<|emo_fear|> I am just scared and wish I was able to get off at a later date so I can enjoy this moment with you.
4116,<|emo_fear|> i feeling nervous all the time
4117,<|emo_fear|> I'm sorry. It's terrible. I hope you have bounce back.
4118,<|emo_fear|> The only bad thing about Christmas is the amount of fake news that gets spread on it
4119,<|emo_fear|> i dont like feeling anxious or excited to work out
4121,<|emo_fear|> *meows for more meat*
4122,<|emo_fear|> Omg how terrifying
4123,<|emo_fear|> i can feel frightened
4124,<|emo_fear|> im feeling so fearful of not being able to get out to where my son lives right now
4125,<|emo_fear|> I'm still waiting for the [NAME] reference... :(
4126,<|emo_fear|> i couldnt help but feel a little uncomfortable talking about my problems
4127,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel frightened by the cold
4128,<|emo_fear|> i know is how much I have come to care about other people i always feel intimidated by the questions they ask
4129,<|emo_fear|> i know that he doesnt really have much to say it feels as if he is an entirely submissive being and that s terrifying to think about
4130,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] is a fucking hero
4131,<|emo_fear|> i feel like it s totally inadequate
4132,<|emo_fear|> im feeling quite doubtful about this one
4133,<|emo_fear|> im feeling really shaky and the wind is blowing really strong
4134,<|emo_fear|> Omg the face
4135,<|emo_fear|> i feel terrified because im never going to see it
4136,<|emo_fear|> i know it is but i m still feeling weird for not wanting to keep a little of their money for gifts
4137,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling quite timid today
4138,<|emo_fear|> i cant help feeling a little apprehensive about the whole thing
4139,<|emo_fear|> i know i could have done more but god i feel like i ve been beaten up
4140,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little scared
4141,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel overwhelmed by the situation
4142,<|emo_fear|> That was an incredibly dangerous move. It's pretty scary at this point. Probably isn't worth it.
4143,<|emo_fear|> That's so terrifying. I hope she knows how to handle it and is prepared for anything.
4144,<|emo_fear|> i didnt know why i felt so terrified and helpless and in love with this picture
4145,<|emo_fear|> i feel kinda afraid
4146,<|emo_fear|> The only problem I had was my left eye which started to hurt after an hour or so which I think was resolved by taking a picture before bed.
4148,<|emo_fear|> This is a horrible idea
4149,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling a little overwhelmed by the work but not by the responsibilities because i feel like its a worthwhile thing without it too
4150,<|emo_fear|> This is the kind of scare I get from here...
4151,<|emo_fear|> i can picture myself feeling terrified or scared for what could happen
4152,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] was actually amazing as [NAME] but I think the movie is more his fault for making him too scary for DnD fans
4153,<|emo_fear|> i feel completely helpless when i can t do anything that will help
4154,<|emo_fear|> im feeling reluctant to give this gift to someone else
4155,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling unsure as to what i want to do to change the direction of life at large
4156,<|emo_fear|> i can remember feeling skeptical and uncertain until the last days
4157,<|emo_fear|> Oh god another injury
4158,<|emo_fear|> Sooo unexpected. I’m so happy for you. I’m scared for you. 🤣
4159,<|emo_fear|> i feel very nervous anxious and a little bit worse than i was on friday
4160,<|emo_fear|> I’m worried about that too. I’m so grateful to have them over for dinner tonight to help me sort that out!
4161,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little uncertain about my writing now but am hopeful
4162,<|emo_fear|> im feeling suspicious i may change it tomorrow but until i do
4163,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] I'm so jealous xD
4164,<|emo_fear|> I mean this team is terrible but I still feel absolutely terrible for the fans
4165,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid about
4166,"<|emo_fear|> No, it was my favorite game to watch grew up so I'm crying for old people"
4167,<|emo_fear|> i did not feel afraid that something was going to happen at any point
4169,<|emo_fear|> i feel very distraught and frightened over it
4170,<|emo_fear|> i feel like i have been pressured into doing something and then disappointed that i wasn t interested
4171,<|emo_fear|> ive become something i feel so helpless and scared
4172,<|emo_fear|> i feel nervous about going back
4173,<|emo_fear|> i got here i feel strange tonight
4174,<|emo_fear|> i have a feeling that in the depths of the depths of my heart i will find the true path that i have been following for years and years
4175,<|emo_fear|> i also feel fearful that i might lose all my points if im honest
4176,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling very frightened and thought im going crazy
4177,<|emo_fear|> i didnt know this but a lot of other times when i have anxiety and feeling helpless a reason to feel helpless i find myself feeling helpless
4178,<|emo_fear|> im feeling anxious and out of place
4179,<|emo_fear|> That is truly frightening
4181,<|emo_fear|> This is a terrible list
4182,<|emo_fear|> This is the stupidest thing i've seen this week.
4183,<|emo_fear|> i have a feeling it may look weird
4184,<|emo_fear|> i feel like she seems scared and insecure and i hope she and my dad have some talks
4185,<|emo_fear|> i have been feeling a bit anxious
4186,<|emo_fear|> > and I think I was abused at the hands of an angry old man 
4187,"<|emo_fear|> Oof, I got my popcorn ready. Have to cut back on the junk. :("
4188,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a bit uncertain about the entire thing that is going to happen with my boyfriend as i continue to grow closer
4189,<|emo_fear|> i do love it when my friends ask how i am feeling they make me feel very nervous
4192,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant to try out new media at the last minute and this is how i make the most of my time
4194,<|emo_fear|> My [NAME] looks just like my aunt. Aunt is in her late 40's and has the exact same look. Very scary.
4195,"<|emo_fear|> I'm so nervous that this is gonna land me in huge trouble, yikes. Well, good for you! I'm gonna be here to support you, xD"
4196,<|emo_fear|> im feeling shaken up a bit by what took place tonight but i am able to continue this blog
4197,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little less afraid
4198,<|emo_fear|> im feeling pretty indecisive today
4199,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant being unsure and reluctant to look in the mirror
4200,"<|emo_fear|> Yeah, my bad."
4201,<|emo_fear|> i still would make the mistake of feeling less frightened
4203,<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid I'm gonna get the shits :/
4204,<|emo_fear|> What a terrible list.
4206,<|emo_fear|> It's creepy
4207,<|emo_fear|> i feel very anxious about it
4208,<|emo_fear|> i do think its dangerous to mix them up but at the same time im not sure if anything thats really going to happen in the near future
4209,<|emo_fear|> i feel apprehensive and nervous
4210,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling a little reluctant to talk to her and even a little scared to let go
4211,<|emo_fear|> oh and r/narrativearratives got banned for including it
4212,<|emo_fear|> i dont think i have ever felt so unsure of myself and what i stood for
4213,<|emo_fear|> i remember feeling shy and alone and all because i couldnt speak my own language
4214,"<|emo_fear|> Omg a drop pass worked. I almost didn't throw the ball, but then [NAME] came in and pressured me like nobody's business"
4215,<|emo_fear|> i will definitely start feeling panic attacks
4216,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a bit shy to point them out
4217,<|emo_fear|> I am not a child molester. I just found out my little sister is one. No apologies needed from me or my dad- I just found out..
4218,<|emo_fear|> i feel anxious around him i would not say he is doubtful
4219,<|emo_fear|> i can feel myself getting agitated now
4220,<|emo_fear|> i really have thought these things through and feel really burdened by it as i try to find the balance of loving people and myself
4221,<|emo_fear|> He just got called out for another questionable holding foul on [NAME]. [NAME] is getting out scritched.
4222,<|emo_fear|> i get the feeling that she was expecting a very violent reaction
4223,<|emo_fear|> i had been feeling apprehensive about trying this and its a big shift from going to a church service with my parents and feeling like ive lost everything
4224,<|emo_fear|> i went home feeling terrified and incredibly grateful never knowing where i was and what ive done wrong
4225,<|emo_fear|> im really nervous about this
4226,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless as i watch helpless people in the background
4227,"<|emo_fear|> [NAME] I know it's weird, but do you still do it?"
4229,<|emo_fear|> i feel anxious a lot lately
4230,<|emo_fear|> i feel intimidated to try it
4231,<|emo_fear|> i think they were frustrated and felt helpless because we didnt have the money that was needed
4232,"<|emo_fear|> In the mean time tho, I’m wondering why you’re not getting the followup items. And I’m only curious because you actually did get it "
4233,<|emo_fear|> i do feel a bit frightened
4234,<|emo_fear|> i feel very shaken that my baby is afraid to sleep outside
4235,<|emo_fear|> It’s called climate change and the continued release of human suffering. It’s also called a crisis because there’s no way to respond to it except through war.
4236,<|emo_fear|> i started feeling a little apprehensive while walking the dog
4237,<|emo_fear|> i was starting to feel quite apprehensive about the whole thing
4238,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling quite apprehensive about it
4239,<|emo_fear|> i just feel really awkward while im writing when i see her
4240,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid that im getting caught in the crossfire of politics and opinion in this country
4241,<|emo_fear|> i do not feel anxious
4242,<|emo_fear|> i do not feel fearful
4243,<|emo_fear|> This made me sad. RIP
4244,<|emo_fear|> i can t help feeling uncertain
4245,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] was horrendous that game. Absolutely brutal. Now he's just horrible
4246,<|emo_fear|> The fact that he's aian gives me anxiety
4247,<|emo_fear|> i do not know how to feel terrified to use them
4248,<|emo_fear|> i feel slightly insecure
4249,<|emo_fear|> i feel weird writing about the stuff in this blog without using the pen name at all
4250,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling a little apprehensive about trusting a stranger in my home town since i am single and somewhat recent immigrants
4251,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling skeptical about all of this
4252,"<|emo_fear|> But as much as I'd love [NAME] to turn [NAME] into a meat deliverer, that's just not going to happen."
4253,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit skeptical about it
4254,<|emo_fear|> i have a feeling things could get a little messy around me if i have the slightest thing go wrong
4255,<|emo_fear|> But I think it could be worse! There’s no sign of her at all
4256,<|emo_fear|> Lol i should move here
4257,<|emo_fear|> i feel frightened and anxious if i go outside
4258,<|emo_fear|> I was afraid it might
4259,"<|emo_fear|> I was a little afraid but it seems like its gonna be really scary and full of tons of doors, traps, and stairs. "
4261,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling pretty doubtful about everything on my new blog
4262,<|emo_fear|> i cant help but feel a bit apprehensive as to what the future may hold
4263,<|emo_fear|> I have no idea what your argument is but I hope you’re not crazy.
4264,<|emo_fear|> We are now at a critical mass as a society and [NAME] is the biggest problem.
4265,<|emo_fear|> im feeling hesitant with the story
4266,<|emo_fear|> i feel so scared about having a relationship again
4267,<|emo_fear|> He’s not going to beat [NAME] tomorrow night. I’m terrified for this team.
4268,<|emo_fear|> i get the feeling that he was a reluctant friend so now im afraid of getting him wrong again
4269,<|emo_fear|> i could feel myself terrified of going there and was afraid it s the worst
4270,<|emo_fear|> So you're from the developing world. You're quite skeptical.
4271,<|emo_fear|> i do not feel afraid to say yes
4272,<|emo_fear|> i know that i will feel anxious but also worry that i feel helpless
4273,<|emo_fear|> It's creepy and weird
4274,"<|emo_fear|> What's the cringe you're talking about? I haven't seen it, sorry for my ignorance."
4275,<|emo_fear|> That is so disgusting.
4276,<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid it's just a scam
4277,<|emo_fear|> i hope you stay safe this weekend because this is extremely scary to talk about
4279,<|emo_fear|> im not feeling suspicious at all i know that it is not right so ill just say it
4280,"<|emo_fear|> I don't know if [NAME] is joking, but it still makes me shake. The dude has the fucking WORSTNAME "
4282,<|emo_fear|> A little girl told me how she was beaten up by her neighbors for going outside
4283,<|emo_fear|> im trying not to put too much onto this but its been a few days and im feeling a bit apprehensive but i cant lose my sleep
4284,"<|emo_fear|> It's more of a vibe tbh, but I've experienced this a lot as well"
4285,<|emo_fear|> What is scary? /r/tworeddit I am afraid of being eaten
4286,<|emo_fear|> i hope he gets what he deserve and can look back at his story and see how he went about going about making his own life
4287,<|emo_fear|> Ouch. That hurt so good
4288,<|emo_fear|> When I was a kid I had the biggest crush on [NAME] from Footballer's Wives...and she's still with me now
4289,<|emo_fear|> Omg [NAME] a fucking centaur!
4290,<|emo_fear|> Well I'm more scared of the sky than I was when I was a kid.
4291,<|emo_fear|> i have a feeling may not be the right word to describe the way my mind has been playing me for weeks
4292,"<|emo_fear|> I was trying to see if my car wouldn't start because of that, and then worse... the girl in the video started it instead - I can clearly remember that"
4293,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little fearful now that its been two and a half years
4294,<|emo_fear|> It's scary.
4295,<|emo_fear|> i feel anxious and afraid of everything
4297,<|emo_fear|> i can t stand feeling anxious
4298,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit terrified just looking at the pictures
4300,"<|emo_fear|> A girl screaming ""[NAME]"" in Scottish brogue probably isn’t going to get the boy next time I see her."
4301,<|emo_fear|> i think i feel a little reluctant to go back to amp because i dont want to put all that blame on her
4302,<|emo_fear|> i was sitting down feeling nervous and i remember feeling a little nervous myself
4303,<|emo_fear|> What a bad list
4304,<|emo_fear|> i couldnt help but feel frightened for my family who i thought was just trying to do the best for them with their life
4305,"<|emo_fear|> Yeah that's a bad one to say, I've never had a cold while pregnant."
4306,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling quite hesitant about the episode
4307,<|emo_fear|> She was also pregnant with my baby
4308,<|emo_fear|> i feel pretty pressured to report this
4309,<|emo_fear|> i feel very shaky right now
4310,<|emo_fear|> i feel anxious and want to kill myself
4311,<|emo_fear|> i will say i dont have reason to believe that this happened for a reason i feel nervous about it
4312,<|emo_fear|> i still feel intimidated by her
4313,<|emo_fear|> im feeling kinda scared that ill lose my job
4314,<|emo_fear|> There’s a lot of weird stuff on there
4315,<|emo_fear|> i feel more indecisive
4316,<|emo_fear|> i do feel reluctant to look for any sort of safety nets to help with this
4317,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little hesitant about it
4318,<|emo_fear|> So we can call a spade a spade if they dont do the job honestly and correctly
4319,<|emo_fear|> i feel that a lot of people are hesitant to call their own parents and that s a bummer
4320,<|emo_fear|> I have done this before with my cats and they were very scared when they saw my raised fist in the air!
4321,<|emo_fear|> i feel as if i have been a little tortured this month
4322,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid even to talk to strangers
4323,<|emo_fear|> im feeling shy this evening of freaking all over myself
4324,<|emo_fear|> My 2 favorites 🔥
4325,<|emo_fear|> im not sure if im anxious or just feeling a little bit unsure
4326,<|emo_fear|> im feeling nervous this morning because im unsure about everything
4327,<|emo_fear|> i feel so nervous about all this
4328,<|emo_fear|> i just feel so tortured
4329,<|emo_fear|> i couldnt help feeling a little shy
4330,<|emo_fear|> i started feeling pretty shaken up after that
4331,<|emo_fear|> i can feel more anxious
4332,<|emo_fear|> i would feel terrified i would not know where and why
4334,<|emo_fear|> i feel pressured to say anything because the world will see what he has to say
4335,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little reluctant to give this a chance for a review
4336,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure of everything
4337,<|emo_fear|> They were just there to defend [NAME] who insulted them and the crowd laughed along with him
4338,<|emo_fear|> i am so far from having this kind of trust when it comes to trusting people but it still hurts to feeling uncertain now
4339,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling skeptical today over my ability to scale back my spending
4340,<|emo_fear|> Your dog looks like a bear. Scary.
4341,<|emo_fear|> im feeling quite worried about it
4342,<|emo_fear|> > And [NAME] is a worse than [NAME] [NAME] is worse than [NAME]
4343,"<|emo_fear|> I can't get off, it's so painful "
4344,<|emo_fear|> i feel pretty scared for them
4345,"<|emo_fear|> I was like this too, then I realized I had a problem with depression so I tried to deal with it instead of thinking I would go insane"
4346,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant to be a part of something as big as this
4347,<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid you're completely correct. And I'm truly sorry for your loss.
4348,<|emo_fear|> How very scary.
4349,<|emo_fear|> i have a feeling im not alone in feeling doubtful about the whole theory
4350,<|emo_fear|> Your momma is a monster!
4351,<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid to ask my parents
4352,<|emo_fear|> She always looks so uncomfortable during auditions. She'll do anything to hide her face... So cringe.
4353,<|emo_fear|> i would feel so stupid saying this
4354,<|emo_fear|> Your posting history is nothing short of creepy.
4355,<|emo_fear|> Holy shit.
4356,<|emo_fear|> I can't stand up straight and it scared me when I first started.
4357,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] was terrible this year but was probably the best pass protection guy on that defense
4358,<|emo_fear|> the reason why i hated my job so much is because i felt pressured to do it
4360,<|emo_fear|> *Ouch! That hurt my gaba*
4361,<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid I should. I'm not a doctor myself so please don't take anything I say as serious advice.
4363,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little bit intimidated and apprehensive about going back though
4364,"<|emo_fear|> That'd be sex crimes again, unless of course the victim is older, and in which case its child neglect. "
4365,<|emo_fear|> There it is.
4366,<|emo_fear|> i think the thing that makes you feel most apprehensive is the lack of any idea of what to do with the money
4367,<|emo_fear|> i really didn t know what to feel about this until about a week ago when i began to blog my first few months of being here
4368,<|emo_fear|> That’s my worry
4369,<|emo_fear|> Lol ok I didn’t make the post for any financial gain. It just states a fact that I’m terrified of what the future will bring
4370,<|emo_fear|> i feel like even though i hated it and i hated being a virgin all the time it made me terrified enough at how much of a thing i was
4371,<|emo_fear|> She said this a couple times during the interview and I was freaking out and shaking. Just reading through all of her things I can't believe she would say that. So cringy.
4372,<|emo_fear|> This is so scary to know that the people you love might be watching.
4373,<|emo_fear|> i remember feeling nervous and anxious because i was expecting such great news
4374,<|emo_fear|> i said that feeling was scary
4375,<|emo_fear|> i can remember feeling so shocked
4376,<|emo_fear|> i feel very shaken up by what happened last night
4377,<|emo_fear|> i feel so terrified for her that i am hesitant to let her go
4378,<|emo_fear|> In the worst fashion possible.
4379,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im being more indecisive and indecisive the more im unsure
4380,"<|emo_fear|> She’s not your friend, period. Stay away from her. "
4381,<|emo_fear|> i feel completely uncertain about my future
4382,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] should get a lot of blame for that injury...sooner rather than later
4383,"<|emo_fear|> Damn, I hope so. I'm a bit worried it's just a bot or something."
4384,<|emo_fear|> This is scary to know that someone out there has it in them to do this.
4386,"<|emo_fear|> This is actually scary to know that we ran a full 6 seconds on [NAME], that's insane"
4387,<|emo_fear|> i just feel very doubtful
4388,"<|emo_fear|> What an idiotic thing to say. I want to be wrong but believe me, it'd be painful 😂"
4389,<|emo_fear|> This is nightmare fuel
4390,<|emo_fear|> i feel so stupid now
4392,<|emo_fear|> i feel so scared to go back
4394,<|emo_fear|> i can feel more and more terrified
4395,<|emo_fear|> This post and thread are killing me.
4396,"<|emo_fear|> I didn't read it, but from what I can remember the president didn't make it through his first speech without getting heckled."
4397,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared to look out my window
4398,<|emo_fear|> My mom is turning 15 this month and is terrified of going into debt. We will be fine.
4400,<|emo_fear|> This is a terrible thing to say...
4401,<|emo_fear|> i don t know how she can be so selfish if she really really likes everyone that knows her but i am sure she is afraid to have it tested
4402,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little hesitant when writing these things down because i know what is going around me and how little of how i can trust what i write so to speak
4403,<|emo_fear|> It's so creepy.
4404,<|emo_fear|> When you're 40 and your ex is 35. Good luck out there xo
4405,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little bit nervous about
4406,<|emo_fear|> > [NAME] I still wish she'd turn the cuffs on for [NAME] then.
4407,<|emo_fear|> There were also 6.11 and 7.42. They changed the Laws to specifically target non-muslim. That would be so terrible.
4408,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a bit skeptical again tonight im going to see if i can put my finger on the source of this strange feeling and see what it has to do with the song of a href http http julieyourehappily Married
4409,<|emo_fear|> i feel apprehensive for weeks while i deal with the loss but i finally learn to trust my instincts and heal myself
4410,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure and afraid
4411,<|emo_fear|> i have been feeling frantic with the new baby and i am wondering if my mom has been having an episode of no-sick
4412,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a bit less reluctant to head back to the office
4413,<|emo_fear|> I remember my first panic attack when I saw that face
4414,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure of what to do
4415,"<|emo_fear|> The creepiest way is talking online, i think its mostly just people at work"
4416,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling paranoid and insecure but the only way forward I think is to find someone else to talk to
4417,<|emo_fear|> oh my god
4418,"<|emo_fear|> I think these are probably true. My advice is to talk with your health care team. If they think it might be a problem, they need to talk to you more."
4419,"<|emo_fear|> ""I want my kid to wear swim trunks to prom because it'll scare girls at the prom"""
4420,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] has played better but still scares me
4421,"<|emo_fear|> Because in some circles fear is power, and that scares the pants off them too. "
4422,<|emo_fear|> i remember feeling so scared at times when i was pregnant and i remember seeing a sign saying you are safe if you are looking through a hole in a dam because it was water
4423,<|emo_fear|> Because they fear for their lives...
4424,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling afraid as i listen on to this radio program
4425,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling apprehensive for the visit
4426,<|emo_fear|> Ahh damn it
4427,<|emo_fear|> I'm still really shaken up by it all. She said it was because she was afraid for her life...
4428,<|emo_fear|> They’re terrible parents that’re probably never going to correct anything.
4429,<|emo_fear|> My biggest fear is catching her when I'm done petting her.
4431,<|emo_fear|> No. What hurts more is if he just resigned the day after the shooting in order to protect her. That just makes more sense to me.
4432,<|emo_fear|> I'm so scared to try... I think the one in Newhall is the best...
4433,<|emo_fear|> i just had a horrible feeling i would feel that strange sense of panic well up in my stomach
4434,<|emo_fear|> i would just feel helpless helpless because he has no idea where his money is being spent
4436,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared of trusting the people who are making these changes
4437,<|emo_fear|> im sorry to hear that and i do feel weird when im feeling unsure for some reason and i want to do better
4438,"<|emo_fear|> This guy has become a big MNT fan, and I hate him. "
4439,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel anything shy
4440,<|emo_fear|> What a weird post omg
4441,"<|emo_fear|> >I'm afraid, sadly, that's not the case."
4442,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel anxious as i usually would because i have an amazing team of leaders and advisors who work hand in hand with me day and night and i wouldnt be if it werent for them
4443,"<|emo_fear|> [NAME] made me feel bad for asking, ""Is there any way you can help?"" "
4444,<|emo_fear|> i feel terrified on the inside
4445,<|emo_fear|> i feel paranoid right now
4446,<|emo_fear|> i feel pressured to come up with some cool stuff
4447,"<|emo_fear|> This is some of the creepiest stuff I've ever seen. Lots of shaky camera work, creepy creepy."
4448,"<|emo_fear|> This is not satire, it's sad."
4449,<|emo_fear|> i feel weird when i use the phrase i wanted someone to love me and see that i was wrong
4450,<|emo_fear|> You are creepy
4451,<|emo_fear|> i began to feel very doubtful of her
4452,"<|emo_fear|> I know, the dude was so calm and collected the entire time."
4453,<|emo_fear|> im really very grateful for being able to see what my mom and dad have tried and failed to do on their own
4454,<|emo_fear|> The sad thing is I think that is actually what the [NAME] wanted. They’re scared of being associated with [NAME] anymore... That’s their fear
4455,<|emo_fear|> i have been feeling very indecisive for some reason
4456,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling a bit lonely and want to chat
4457,<|emo_fear|> A woman washes her car after an accident probably happened because she felt his feet on the gas.
4460,<|emo_fear|> i do feel reluctant and guilty over it but i feel also guilty knowing her well and that she told me in my meeting
4461,<|emo_fear|> If you aren't from Ontario it's pretty grim.
4463,<|emo_fear|> im feeling weird because i was eating normally and feeling fine just after school last week
4464,<|emo_fear|> i feel so uncertain and unacknowledged
4465,<|emo_fear|> i had thought the other day that i would feel a little less afraid
4466,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared and confused
4467,<|emo_fear|> i remember feeling somewhat afraid in a room full of bright lights and moving only very slowly
4468,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless like i have no control
4470,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure and anxious with my personal and professional life
4471,"<|emo_fear|> No, he lost more than 30 lbs from the waist down."
4472,<|emo_fear|> That is so scary. I hope you are doing okay. Stay strong!
4473,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant to share my story because it could be dangerous
4474,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] was in foul trouble so [NAME] was just about to get free. [NAME] stopped and stuck his tongue out.
4475,<|emo_fear|> this is literally me! i feel the same way mom does when she's scared for her room
4476,<|emo_fear|> It's pretty terrifying when that creepy old man shows up right after the game to congratulate you on your new outfit.
4477,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little afraid
4478,<|emo_fear|> This is so scary to know [NAME] is watching. Good thing [NAME] was just talking about making him sign this.
4479,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling fairly apprehensive having not yet taken any trips
4480,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling unsure what he wanted with me and worried that i would just move on and leave him
4481,<|emo_fear|> i know i m feeling skeptical
4482,<|emo_fear|> So sorry to hear that is what it is
4483,<|emo_fear|> i also feel intimidated by the work i have ahead of me in college
4484,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] has posted videos without Sound support on his channel
4485,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling overwhelmed by our busy lives as mom and dad
4487,<|emo_fear|> i woke up feeling extremely fearful and i was actually scared to tell friends about that
4489,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very worried and anxious
4490,<|emo_fear|> i feel very uncertain about her
4491,<|emo_fear|> It's like the third grade version of [NAME] and [NAME] from Kid Icarus. I'm so scared
4492,<|emo_fear|> How scary.
4493,<|emo_fear|> i feel slightly shocked that it is difficult for a non working adult to hold a job
4494,<|emo_fear|> Yeah. Its hard to come by in south florida. I feel like it's a dying breed sometimes.
4495,<|emo_fear|> i feel very hesitant going into it
4497,<|emo_fear|> A big fear I have is just not being seen so much. I'm terrified of saying the wrong thing or getting in trouble
4498,<|emo_fear|> This scares me for some reason...
4499,<|emo_fear|> I'm not scared at all
4502,<|emo_fear|> He was taken to the hospital and later died.
4503,<|emo_fear|> i feel apprehensive and uncertain about everything and all
4504,<|emo_fear|> He was a little injured coming out of cancer but now he’s doing really well. I’m so happy for him too. 😊
4505,<|emo_fear|> I just had a panic attack!
4506,<|emo_fear|> i was so agitated right from his words when he said he liked sleep paralysis and i was at a dead end feeling like what is he talking about
4507,"<|emo_fear|> Yeah the stuff that makes you sick is the junk food, video games, etc. that you keep on your desk/shouldnt be touched!!"
4508,<|emo_fear|> i have tried to keep a low profile and i feel uncomfortable in the public eye
4509,<|emo_fear|> i feel very scared
4510,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very apprehensive about it all around
4511,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very nervous but that nervousness is tempered by a sense of pride
4512,<|emo_fear|> i can feel the fear creepily in my chest
4513,<|emo_fear|> Well this was the saddest thing I've seen today
4514,<|emo_fear|> I think about my children I'm a horrible person.
4515,<|emo_fear|> i still feel a little unsure of myself
4516,<|emo_fear|> i feel so insecure
4517,"<|emo_fear|> You're saying she's a horrible human being, and it's fine because the government shut her down."
4518,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little anxious about it
4519,<|emo_fear|> There is a disturbing amount of NREMT in the food supply now that we know that.
4521,<|emo_fear|> i feel less fearful of him i feel more like i could be him
4522,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant posting them as i am feeling fearful
4523,<|emo_fear|> It was worse than I thought it would be! At first it seemed really shaky and shaky was it really true or just me? :( I think both
4524,<|emo_fear|> i feel kinda shaky so im trying to keep myself on a daily schedule and eating healthy for the environment of what ive done so far
4525,<|emo_fear|> i have a feeling is she trying to find out how she can turn him into a loyal and loving pet because how painful it will make me to put up with he seems to know exactly what she has into this
4527,<|emo_fear|> I'm scared to think about what might happen to me*...
4528,"<|emo_fear|> Yeah, they've all done it to me. It's the one thing that keeps me alive. *shudders* "
4529,<|emo_fear|> i dont know how i feel im afraid i dont know how i could ever trust again
4530,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling a little unsure in my life but i do believe in myself
4531,<|emo_fear|> i feel kind of shy around him
4532,<|emo_fear|> i feel like an eager kid who hes not old enough to know what age means
4534,<|emo_fear|> That's one way to label someone a fascist.
4535,<|emo_fear|> i felt afraid as the door shut at my back that night had a giant hole in my heart
4536,"<|emo_fear|> This would be the worst if the music was terrible, [NAME] just kills with his screams."
4537,<|emo_fear|> i have been feeling very helpless
4538,<|emo_fear|> i really can t believe how well it has turned out
4540,<|emo_fear|> i feel like a fake
4542,<|emo_fear|> The creepy-as-hell-but-cute-in-a-baker sorta face!
4543,<|emo_fear|> im already feeling very apprehensive and anxious about this visit
4544,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling a little weird lately because of my new life on this planet
4545,<|emo_fear|> i know is that i was feeling afraid but is that fear now a thing or should i be more concerned about it now that things have changed much more than i was?
4546,<|emo_fear|> The face. The entire face. It’s horrifying
4547,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling very reluctant lately to leave home early this week
4548,<|emo_fear|> im just feeling hesitant about it
4549,<|emo_fear|> i actually feel pretty shaken up
4550,"<|emo_fear|> Well that sucks, hope you’re doing better now. If not, I hope you’re able to move past it eventually."
4552,<|emo_fear|> i feel like i do because im terrified
4553,<|emo_fear|> i love the smell of spoiled milk and can t bear the taste i can t bear the taste
4554,<|emo_fear|> i get scared just reading your username
4555,<|emo_fear|> They are scared of press
4556,<|emo_fear|> i feel more agitated because i dont know how the situation is going to pan out and i dont even know who the injured guy is in and i already know the guy is badly injured but i dont know his name
4557,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant saying that
4558,"<|emo_fear|> Ouch, that left a mark, didn't know I was still around. Good news is they expect you to take it easy as this is something new."
4559,<|emo_fear|> >[NAME] I could never love anyone as much as [NAME] loved herself
4560,"<|emo_fear|> *shudders, looks at the clock* 8:13 PM?"
4561,<|emo_fear|> i do not feel pressured at all
4562,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling nervous and anxious as i type this
4563,<|emo_fear|> i am starting to feel reluctant about this new type of work
4564,<|emo_fear|> i actually feel like im being paranoid
4565,<|emo_fear|> My favorite is the one where she ends up nearly pressing charges against the cop for her own protection because she knew he was going to shoot her anyways.
4566,<|emo_fear|> I feel the blood pressure goes up another 2/3s.
4567,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling really reluctant to get these posts out to anyone so i may seem like i have been a little bit wimpy about writing but in reality im really just been thrilled
4568,"<|emo_fear|> *I’m crying, just read the opening lines* I don’t know what to do."
4569,"<|emo_fear|> *""Wow""*"
4570,<|emo_fear|> im feeling nervous excited and excited just knowing if you will be as generous as i will be
4571,<|emo_fear|> ive no idea what they are so excited about but feeling very unsure and scared
4572,<|emo_fear|> i feel nervous but nothing materializes
4573,<|emo_fear|> i could also point out that the amount of effort that someone goes into writing a piece that is well written can make it seem like if i had more effort but i cant afford to lose my jobs while i am at it
4574,<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid we just broke the ice with this.
4575,"<|emo_fear|> No, what you are saying is that racism is bad because racism is bad. That’s a lie."
4576,<|emo_fear|> i must say that there is nothing that i feel scared of
4577,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling really hesitant about posting pictures this semester as i am afraid it will become something terrifying and dreadful that a href http bryanspost
4578,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a bit apprehensive about finally seeing it
4579,<|emo_fear|> That's not really what I said. I just felt so sad for you guys and what your situation has been like for the last week. You deserve better.
4580,<|emo_fear|> i went around town looking for signs of life and suddenly i was in a big abandoned building with only a bed and a chair for people to lie in
4581,"<|emo_fear|> [NAME]? For real? I thought they still gave him the odd *fifth*, but he never got to make more than 5"
4582,<|emo_fear|> i feel terrified that i am going to let someones idea of what i am as a person and what i do have come to light and that my friends and myself are a different animal
4583,<|emo_fear|> This is the worst I've ever seen
4584,<|emo_fear|> It's crazy I actually turned that off years ago because I got into the idea that it was really creepy.
4585,<|emo_fear|> im feeling pretty uncertain right now
4586,<|emo_fear|> A creepy mr.
4587,<|emo_fear|> i have said before that if i were to stop writing i would feel terrified
4588,<|emo_fear|> i always feel shy and scared
4589,<|emo_fear|> i find myself feeling incredibly hesitant and anxious on this day
4590,<|emo_fear|> Oh [NAME] it is!
4591,<|emo_fear|> I fear for your safety as a result.
4592,<|emo_fear|> i feel skeptical and hesitant about all these plans
4593,<|emo_fear|> i feel nervous but i feel the same about this job i dont want to do something stupid like run away from my problems away
4594,<|emo_fear|> i just feel helpless
4595,<|emo_fear|> There are worse states!!
4596,<|emo_fear|> i also feel vulnerable or guilty
4597,<|emo_fear|> This is the saddest I've seen
4599,<|emo_fear|> I'm scared for y'all saying we don't want to play [NAME].
4600,<|emo_fear|> i can go weeks without feeling any ill effects
4601,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little frantic
4602,<|emo_fear|> I'm scared for my 2-year-old.
4603,<|emo_fear|> i just feel so fearful about it all
4604,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little apprehensive before we set off on our first adventure
4605,<|emo_fear|> i feel uncertain and uncertain and that s scary
4606,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel like i m terrified of who i m speaking to because my fears are subsides
4607,<|emo_fear|> What a fucking cunt
4608,<|emo_fear|> This was a lot worse than I thought it would be
4609,<|emo_fear|> i feel very apprehensive about posting these things as a stranger
4610,<|emo_fear|> I'm so scared to tell my mom. I hate it.
4612,<|emo_fear|> i know is that i know that i look a lot more innocent than i do when i m feeling insecure
4613,<|emo_fear|> im feeling kinda apprehensive about it
4614,<|emo_fear|> i know im on shaky ground but after two days i feel less fearful
4615,<|emo_fear|> This makes me want to die
4616,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite shocked at the amount of support i have for this
4617,<|emo_fear|> i feel paranoid and i don t make it clear what i want to do about it
4620,<|emo_fear|> i feel a hesitant grasp at the back of my neck
4621,<|emo_fear|> Because they were afraid of the KKK.
4622,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless im broken
4623,<|emo_fear|> I'm in my early 2nd year so maybe even I'm an older adult. What a weird question.
4624,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little apprehensive about this
4625,"<|emo_fear|> It's all out of anger and self-loathing, which is probably why he's become a very selfing guy. "
4626,<|emo_fear|> i feel uncertain about everything
4627,<|emo_fear|> i do not think i should be scared when i see an old person i know sitting on an old person s old couch with a baby doll
4628,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling hesitant
4629,<|emo_fear|> i feel very agitated and upset right now
4630,<|emo_fear|> i had always been afraid to write about it but lately im feeling less afraid
4631,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared and anxious and scared that i am going to get hurt again tonight
4632,<|emo_fear|> i feel so intimidated at this point
4633,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel fearful or nervous
4634,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little afraid of things but im looking forward to the challenge of trying them all out
4635,<|emo_fear|> i feel anxious and stuff and very emotional about it all
4636,"<|emo_fear|> Yeah, my bad. It could have been worse."
4637,<|emo_fear|> i feel so indecisive and indecisive sometimes
4638,<|emo_fear|> i have been feeling pretty unsure
4639,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared but i dont like that either
4641,<|emo_fear|> i feel shy of them and dont want to be social
4642,<|emo_fear|> i know what i ve done to him i feel slightly paranoid
4643,<|emo_fear|> i don t have to feel terrified
4644,<|emo_fear|> This story made my day. Ha ha
4645,"<|emo_fear|> I don't like sleeping on the couch because it's uncomfortable to stand up, but I'm just barely into mattress use. "
4646,<|emo_fear|> i would feel scared to be around her
4647,<|emo_fear|> i had left the place feeling shaky
4649,<|emo_fear|> i feel completely helpless to do anything but pray
4650,<|emo_fear|> i think he has this amazing fear that as i get older i am losing his memory
4651,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] is scared out there
4652,<|emo_fear|> i think my emotions may have got the better of me when my anxiety and fear overwhelmed me so much and when i started to feel a little isolated
4653,<|emo_fear|> This is scary as hell.
4654,<|emo_fear|> I was afraid for that white building.
4655,<|emo_fear|> You seem horrible
4656,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] was playing awful tonight after sitting out with a shoulder injury
4657,"<|emo_fear|> It's weird, I feel this in my chest "
4658,<|emo_fear|> i feel extremely skeptical right now
4659,<|emo_fear|> I have been. I don't know what to say to this. I truly can't imagine.
4660,<|emo_fear|> im feeling pretty doubtful about this too
4661,<|emo_fear|> I'm also afraid.
4662,<|emo_fear|> i just don t feel terrified or anxious
4663,<|emo_fear|> I'm scared for y'all saying.
4664,<|emo_fear|> A few months back I had a similar thought but just couldn’t wait to get off the phone with her so I hope that was easy :D
4665,<|emo_fear|> i feel less fearful of leaving the house
4666,<|emo_fear|> i feel so insecure and shy and stuff
4667,<|emo_fear|> i had been feeling apprehensive about the day since the news broke about her going back to alabama to start middle school
4668,<|emo_fear|> im feeling shy because my husband and i have been together for a year and i dont want to be known as this alone
4669,<|emo_fear|> i feel terrified almost all the time
4670,<|emo_fear|> i honestly feel a little hesitant to post this
4671,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to share but my husband and i have decided to because there s no way i would see a doctor if i ve not spent a certain amount of time with a disease
4673,<|emo_fear|> i had not told him about it yet and that left me feeling pretty shaken up that im telling him about it
4674,<|emo_fear|> i feel apprehensive to get out there as a native since i am not native but i fear that if i do that there will be negative repercussions
4675,<|emo_fear|> i feel frightened for my own child
4676,<|emo_fear|> im feeling more vulnerable than before i had any idea
4677,<|emo_fear|> Oh ok sorry
4678,"<|emo_fear|> Yeah its been like this for a few years now, my daughter told me she hates me for it, my daughter told me i should run away from her, my daughter told me i should run away from myself"
4679,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling nervous as i passed by the counter but it seems pretty safe at the moment
4680,<|emo_fear|> She is a monster!
4681,<|emo_fear|> im a bit nervous but im feeling pretty confident that ive found her
4682,<|emo_fear|> I honestly miss [NAME] though so I hope [NAME] brings it back
4685,"<|emo_fear|> [NAME], ive been feeling terrible lately, i never really expected this"
4686,<|emo_fear|> i can feel the pressure but i can also see to this i am not wrong
4687,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling very unsure
4688,<|emo_fear|> i think it s the most valuable thing you can give to someone because if they feel helpless or fearful or anything then they ll likely stop trusting you
4689,<|emo_fear|> This is so scary but true. I was abused as a child and it is still a terrible burden to carry.
4690,"<|emo_fear|> But people get hurt, too. People are stupid. "
4691,<|emo_fear|> i love to cry and feel helpless when something does not turn out ok
4692,<|emo_fear|> im just anxious and worried
4693,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling a little homesick for wisc
4695,<|emo_fear|> I miss him on our pp
4696,<|emo_fear|> Is there any way to edit your flair to remove offensive or illegal material?
4697,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling anxious and worried and afraid when i left the practice
4698,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling quite shy
4699,<|emo_fear|> i started to feel strange
4700,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling so agitated and anxious and worried that i thought id leave the house
4701,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very reluctant to leave
4702,<|emo_fear|> That would be really scary to know that they think you are the same
4703,<|emo_fear|> i was tired of feeling like a lame girl all the time and it s not a combination of the bad days together and the lack of any supportive romantic relationship
4704,<|emo_fear|> i felt a bit shaken up and wondered how we had all come to this point
4705,<|emo_fear|> And how does it feel to have a superpowers superior because you never showed interest?
4706,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant in trusting him
4707,<|emo_fear|> i cant help but feel uncertain
4708,<|emo_fear|> I think it was more of a miscommunication. I meant she’s never leaving his side and just sitting there when he is.
4709,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant to tell them
4711,<|emo_fear|> im feeling weird and nervous thinking about it
4712,<|emo_fear|> Aaaand they're almost all worse in Ontario.
4713,<|emo_fear|> I'm with you. Unhappy tears well up in my eyes while I write this.
4714,<|emo_fear|> i cannot help but feel a bit apprehensive
4716,<|emo_fear|> I can see this but my wife said it's okay too!
4717,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little hesitant about this one
4718,<|emo_fear|> i do feel unsure of my strength on this
4719,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very apprehensive but i wont give up
4720,<|emo_fear|> I've tried this once and it really hurts.
4721,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little hesitant to put much weight on it just because im not used to that kind of stuff and i think i could be afraid of being seen as a weirdo
4722,<|emo_fear|> That's scary.
4723,<|emo_fear|> im feeling suspicious and wondered if he was sick
4724,<|emo_fear|> im here i can feel the chill breeze
4725,<|emo_fear|> i started feeling apprehensive because there were no plans for the week i was going
4726,<|emo_fear|> i feel uncertain and helpless
4727,"<|emo_fear|> I am so sorry that happened to you. We got your back, and you are one of us. I have faith in you."
4728,<|emo_fear|> The thing that makes me most afraid is that they will find something that they cannot use against me and will therefore destroy me.
4729,<|emo_fear|> I feel this from every single person here. She went from being a very active player when she was with us to a passive one just because she couldn’t handle the pressure.
4730,<|emo_fear|> i feel less reluctant to do this
4731,<|emo_fear|> They have one of the weirdest working schedules I've ever seen.
4733,<|emo_fear|> Holy shit we have 6 left now
4734,<|emo_fear|> > She does it because she's insecure. She's insecure all the time.
4735,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling very indecisive and anxious a lot lately
4736,<|emo_fear|> i thought for a moment that the conversation was hopeless because i feel so unsure
4737,<|emo_fear|> im actually feeling a little distraught though
4738,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite reluctant to say i have a disease when i are so young because it sounds so horrible that i feel so much less reluctant
4739,"<|emo_fear|> Oh no, my bad"
4740,<|emo_fear|> this is me Keep It locked
4741,<|emo_fear|> i feel more vulnerable if he keeps showing such behavior
4742,<|emo_fear|> i have this great fear i could lose my sense of hearing if i don t do anything right
4743,<|emo_fear|> And I didn't even know that the president had a Twitter account then
4744,<|emo_fear|> It would also explain why he doesn't like being left alone but would also explain why he's afraid of being left alone.
4745,<|emo_fear|> It honestly scares me if this isn't more regularly covered.
4746,<|emo_fear|> i feel very unsure and confused about my whole world i mean ive been christian and agnostic but im suddenly very aware of being in this
4748,<|emo_fear|> Not impressed.
4749,"<|emo_fear|> They're too afraid to say anything, afraid they'll get burned."
4750,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very apprehensive about it
4751,<|emo_fear|> i must admit im feeling very hesitating and uncertain
4752,<|emo_fear|> i feel pressured to write because people around me do and i cant take the chance that people will hate me if i write again
4753,<|emo_fear|> i have a feeling i will be scared
4754,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very distraught right now
4755,<|emo_fear|> i have a feeling i was in for an unpleasant surprise
4756,<|emo_fear|> i feel very frightened of what is to come
4757,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling nervous
4759,<|emo_fear|> We still have [NAME] [NAME].. So glad he's not us
4761,<|emo_fear|> i am actually feeling frightened by this
4762,<|emo_fear|> I can’t see the light at the end. I miss you [NAME]. :(
4763,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to find an answer to help me
4764,<|emo_fear|> Oh my [NAME] just called telling his GF how he just met this guy who had a weird obsession with her. I’m freaking out as a mother right now.
4765,<|emo_fear|> i know how they feel but i feel suspicious
4766,<|emo_fear|> That's a terrible amount of bp for 3 kills.
4767,<|emo_fear|> i have been feeling very hesitant and out of place in the center of this wonderful community which i had first felt like home
4768,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared and sad
4769,<|emo_fear|> this is one of my worst nightmares actually
4770,<|emo_fear|> How amazing. I feel so badly for you.
4771,<|emo_fear|> i would describe it as having a strange sense of purpose and the feeling that im just a good girl and that what im doing is not right
4773,<|emo_fear|> i feel that is dangerous
4774,<|emo_fear|> i feel very helpless and helpless i have lost my mother and i have no fatherland
4775,<|emo_fear|> im on that line of thinking as i feel nervous as this is the least likely thing that could happen
4776,<|emo_fear|> i started feeling really overwhelmed with things
4777,<|emo_fear|> What? No deal
4779,"<|emo_fear|> I'm scared for r/ComedyCemetery. They've been terrible on [NAME] before, this would be terrible."
4781,<|emo_fear|> i feel kinda pressured to do it
4782,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared and alone in my room
4783,<|emo_fear|> You're too ugly to even bully
4784,<|emo_fear|> i didn t actually have a great conversation with him when i made these two weeks progress photos
4785,"<|emo_fear|> And, you'll have to go on a school trip to get them."
4786,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to write my feelings on this blog
4787,<|emo_fear|> i feel very overwhelmed by it all
4788,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little paranoid
4789,<|emo_fear|> This is horribly clear. It reminds me of a scene in One Piece where Big Mom uses her katakana to call out a defeated captain
4790,<|emo_fear|> I'm not crying. You're crying!
4791,<|emo_fear|> i didn t feel intimidated
4793,<|emo_fear|> > a very dangerous job indeed.
4794,<|emo_fear|> i feel terrified watching them
4795,<|emo_fear|> Oh my [NAME] I just saw the video. I think the guy is drunk - his manner is weird.
4796,<|emo_fear|> i have been feeling pressured to tell my parents about my life and its strange
4798,<|emo_fear|> If it’s for real I’m terrified
4799,"<|emo_fear|> That last scene scared me the fuck out. I really hope the show lives up to those terms, as an artist that's gone through quite a bit, it really terrifies me. "
4800,<|emo_fear|> i feel slightly vulnerable as i understand it might even cause me to become a paralysed or dead squirrel
4801,<|emo_fear|> i start to feel nervous about the exact situation as the car is going to roll over hard
4802,<|emo_fear|> i started to feel anxious about this
4803,<|emo_fear|> So you think the only way to be a respected lord is to insult and mock people? Idk how you'd know without Googling.
4805,<|emo_fear|> i feel strange writing about a child abuse blog even though i know its a bad thing i was feeling nervous about what the author might say
4807,<|emo_fear|> i feel that the girl was a little shaken up by all the fighting that had happened at the bar and was not quite as nice to me
4808,<|emo_fear|> im not sure if i should be nervous about it and be hopeful and just be terrified
4809,<|emo_fear|> i think i was more scared than anything else in the whole world because i was afraid of feeling scared
4810,<|emo_fear|> I’m wondering what it would be like if I did. I’d love a voice actor who could play [NAME]...
4811,<|emo_fear|> i really feel scared and overwhelmed
4812,<|emo_fear|> My favorite kind of food is when it's cold as all hell outside. I get all sweaty and want to take a shower in a tarp or something.
4813,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling apprehensive to get into it
4815,<|emo_fear|> i don t always feel shy when i am around others
4816,<|emo_fear|> i feel pressured into doing something
4817,<|emo_fear|> It's kinda scary to think that in 5 years there will be just as many women who fear breast than there are who have it figured out
4818,"<|emo_fear|> It happened so fast, and it’s the one thing I’m terrified of happening to me, or my family."
4819,"<|emo_fear|> I'm more of a ""it's horrible and I really don't know what to do other than not watch"" kinda guy."
4820,<|emo_fear|> i had a very bad feeling i was going to be okay and i was going to lose it
4821,"<|emo_fear|> He is one of those guys THAT one time you're feeling nervous and want a ""thorough"" read before you rush off to a big meeting..."
4822,<|emo_fear|> im not feeling anxious or anything
4823,<|emo_fear|> That’s what I’m worried about as well! 😮
4824,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling so out of place and somewhat intimidated
4826,<|emo_fear|> i feel very nervous when i hear that the first half of this month is going to be our worst
4827,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling very afraid for my life
4828,<|emo_fear|> i feel so nervous but very excited
4829,"<|emo_fear|> Omg, is this a real thing? I’d love to get a tattoo! 🤣"
4831,<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid she's dead.
4832,<|emo_fear|> i had felt so overwhelmed and feeling like im going to die like a cat like many of you do but im terrified
4833,<|emo_fear|> i feel overwhelmed by so much and i feel like my mind is constantly moving in circles
4834,<|emo_fear|> This is what I fear the most
4835,<|emo_fear|> i still feel a little hesitant that people are getting the wrong message from the video
4836,<|emo_fear|> i feel less fearful of what god does to me in response to all of those scares i have about dying in this life than i do today
4837,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling skeptical and doubtful
4838,<|emo_fear|> i feel very paranoid right now
4839,"<|emo_fear|> I'm worried I will, as the only vaccinated person I know has had terrifying allergic reactions to a round of shots in the past."
4840,<|emo_fear|> i feel extremely strange and I know someone out there who is.
4842,<|emo_fear|> This is so scary but true lol.
4843,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared because i don t know much about the area
4844,<|emo_fear|> I was afraid of that.
4845,<|emo_fear|> i know this is not only a terrible thing to say but i feel so terrified that it would ever happen
4846,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit nervous
4848,<|emo_fear|> You might be right and I should be ashamed of my country.
4849,<|emo_fear|> i can barely remember how i feel in those moments you were there it was a horrifying thing
4851,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite insecure and easily frightened
4852,<|emo_fear|> i feel frightened
4853,<|emo_fear|> i woke up feeling a little shaky
4855,<|emo_fear|> I'm just saying there's a chance he is. That hasn't happened yet unfortunately.
4856,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a bit apprehensive in this case because i had not been feeling this anxious and scared when i took off from a course in early March but i do
4857,<|emo_fear|> You are an awful human being.
4858,<|emo_fear|> i feel that i m in a curious situation because i am also reluctant to make any real statement about it
4859,<|emo_fear|> i feel more agitated and anxious
4860,<|emo_fear|> i must have just become more and more frantic with my task
4861,<|emo_fear|> i don t know why but i feel very helpless when i am trying to think like that
4862,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little shy of telling people
4863,<|emo_fear|> i want to say what i feel is a tender embrace toward your heart and maybe a hand in my hair but it s just my sincere guess that im a bit shaken up over a situation in which i should be so caring for you
4864,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless because of my mental health which is so terrible
4865,<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid that he'll kill me when he finds out.
4866,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im being paranoid something i always do when i have strange scares on my mind
4867,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid to look because i dont know the place
4868,<|emo_fear|> This could have been much worse. Imagine the kid who went to a high school known for using performance enhancing drugs. That scares me about the kid.
4870,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit scared for you
4871,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very insecure and anxious
4872,<|emo_fear|> Ahhh yes. I would not be surprised either
4873,<|emo_fear|> That's awful. I'm sorry.
4874,<|emo_fear|> i honestly feel insecure of my looks and the fact that i know im fat
4875,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant to give away anything from what has been good to great
4877,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling very apprehensive right now
4878,<|emo_fear|> i actually have been feeling very apprehensive about this for a long time
4879,<|emo_fear|> i also had the feeling that were going in a direction that disturbed me
4880,"<|emo_fear|> The only cringe I’ve seen comes from the [NAME] bit, but even that isn’t terrible for an action comedy. "
4881,"<|emo_fear|> In that case, it definitely would be looked at. I can see one guy saying fuck it and not doing anything because his team lost their shit. "
4882,<|emo_fear|> The most recent episode had [NAME] talking about how life is about to get a whole lot worse than what it did in season 1...
4883,<|emo_fear|> I'm so scared!
4884,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to show it off to others because what i posted was too public and too public to be kept out of the public eye
4885,"<|emo_fear|> The only thing better than [NAME] is [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME]. It's just sad that we can't have the same. "
4886,<|emo_fear|> the weird feeling when a book leaves your head It doesn't touch the ground and your hand is still on the cover
4887,"<|emo_fear|> oh no, she is in pain"
4888,<|emo_fear|> i still feel a little unsure about the whole thing
4889,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared that your little one might hear you say that
4890,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling a bit paranoid now
4891,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel terrified or stressed
4892,<|emo_fear|> It’s crazy how easy it is to imagine mass shootings like the one in San Bernardino.
4893,<|emo_fear|> It was more nightmares than anything else. I feel for you.
4894,<|emo_fear|> im just feeling helpless but i can t stop crying
4895,<|emo_fear|> im feeling anxious and not completely comfortable
4896,<|emo_fear|> i see these distressed parents and their anxious children in my office i feel helpless
4898,<|emo_fear|> im not going to put a number on it because im feeling uncertain and worried about everything
4900,<|emo_fear|> im feeling more shaky than usual
4901,<|emo_fear|> The horror.
4902,<|emo_fear|> i feel very frightened and agitated
4903,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit overwhelmed
4905,<|emo_fear|> i feel as though im not as smart when it comes to using that type of language
4906,<|emo_fear|> i see people who have left me the message in an attempt like this why am i feeling so unsure
4907,<|emo_fear|> This is a weird take.
4908,<|emo_fear|> i feeling paranoid
4909,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little insecure right now
4910,<|emo_fear|> This is so terrifying. I thought I was the only one. I'm so lucky to be a stranger.
4911,<|emo_fear|> i feel very unsure of my feelings
4912,<|emo_fear|> i just feel so insecure and im just terrified of it
4913,"<|emo_fear|> Yeah, it’s almost like this episode foreshadowed the end of theUCK. So I can’t be sad for that. "
4914,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite skeptical because i read the most optimistic and optimistic person on the internet said how things could be worse but it is what they are and what you have experienced
4915,<|emo_fear|> I feel your pain - I'm very sorry you fear for your safety. Stay strong!
4916,<|emo_fear|> i feel like it didnt work because i hated feeling like im being paranoid
4917,<|emo_fear|> i was doing ok at school and yet i feel very shaken up and feeling isolated and alone in my life
4918,<|emo_fear|> The saddest thing is this is how one man hoped to get by and raised a family on this shit.
4919,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] has a history of questionable play calling. This is not a confidence issue at all
4920,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless watching this
4921,<|emo_fear|> i feel apprehensive about it
4922,<|emo_fear|> i got up to leave the house feeling nervous and a bit skeptical but i was actually at the store that night
4923,<|emo_fear|> i feel insecure because i dont know what others think of my feelings
4925,<|emo_fear|> i honestly feel a little unsure until i see the crowd reaction
4926,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling scared
4927,<|emo_fear|> I see a lot of weird and scary things on the internet. Which ones are real and/or caused by phrenology?
4928,<|emo_fear|> when i learnt that i had been voted best girl and worst boy and had received three boys names
4929,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] was a terrible defender but he made plays that were both very difficult to defend and were very good passes.
4931,<|emo_fear|> i am starting to feel a bit anxious i don t know exactly where i am or what is next because i have been studying and training in different ways for a very long time
4932,<|emo_fear|> I'm more than pleasantly surprised it's made nearly as much news as it is.
4933,<|emo_fear|> i actually don t feel scared much
4934,<|emo_fear|> This is my biggest fear
4935,<|emo_fear|> i don t want to feel paranoid about going public with my story i want to go on record with my truth because what i know makes me believe the world is not as it seems to me
4936,<|emo_fear|> Is that your real name? I’m surprised you didn’t name him [NAME]
4937,<|emo_fear|> im feeling uncomfortable about this right now
4938,<|emo_fear|> i dont know how i feel im anxious around them even i didnt feel out of place while they were gone
4939,<|emo_fear|> im feeling less anxious and more like im going to be ok the next days
4940,<|emo_fear|> I’m scared for that little girl.
4942,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] was so scared the whole time he was on the net
4943,"<|emo_fear|> I think the same thing, but I'm afraid I don't have the video."
4944,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless and it s so bad
4945,<|emo_fear|> I'm so scared 🤢
4946,"<|emo_fear|> The sad truth is, most of our current crop of centrists actually aren't that far left."
4947,"<|emo_fear|> When I was in high school, people around me would always tell me about their friends who had just done the same thing, so weird I thought it was high school. "
4948,"<|emo_fear|> What a creepy tipster, very creepy indeed."
4949,<|emo_fear|> i have had it with feeling terrified that i missed out on more or less everything with their school
4950,<|emo_fear|> i had been feeling kinda paranoid
4951,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling weirdly restless lately
4952,<|emo_fear|> i feel like being paranoid when things start to go badly
4953,<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid your boyfriend has convinced himself he's fine. :( That would be awful.
4954,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling unsure and afraid
4955,"<|emo_fear|> It just so happens that most popular culture is deeply, utterly and completely obsessed with the idea of a woman being 'raped' or having 'her vagina invaded'. "
4956,<|emo_fear|> This is pretty creepy.
4959,<|emo_fear|> oh [NAME] oh no
4960,<|emo_fear|> i came home feeling a little apprehensive
4961,<|emo_fear|> I find it odd that the [NAME] is more of a distance Runner than a Boxer.
4962,<|emo_fear|> ive never had great success but i feel a little scared that this is something that i might need to do
4963,<|emo_fear|> What's the name of it?
4964,"<|emo_fear|> Yeah, I think he panicked and didn't see it coming. "
4965,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling very apprehensive
4966,<|emo_fear|> This is so scary. I really hope she is okay.
4967,<|emo_fear|> i feel completely paranoid right now
4968,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared because im afraid
4969,<|emo_fear|> im feeling rather apprehensive since im still quite unsure how to plan our days for the coming week and beyond but thats the main thing heres a short bio
4970,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] would rather be playing outside his comfort zone than facing pressure. I was surprised he got that option.
4971,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite shocked and confused and not quite sure what to do right now
4972,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very anxious this morning
4973,<|emo_fear|> i still feel a little shaken up a little confused and a little sad that so much of what i thought i had been able to believe about the world may not be realized
4974,<|emo_fear|> i didnt feel paranoid
4975,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little reluctant to mention the name of the guy because it makes me anxious that he is not the real reason behind the problems that exist at rf and i do not know him
4976,<|emo_fear|> I see more of these everyday. All the time and it gets me so fucking anxious.
4977,"<|emo_fear|> Ahhhhh, that is the worst fear I have, that I will become that which I signed up for! "
4978,"<|emo_fear|> It's weird, I'm from Ireland and my girlfriend's family are all swarthy."
4979,<|emo_fear|> i feel nervous but i guess we know what we are doing
4980,<|emo_fear|> Damn. So that’s what that was. Hope it’s nothing then
4981,<|emo_fear|> i remember feeling intimidated but now i feel more confident than ever in who im a person and what im good at
4982,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit paranoid
4983,<|emo_fear|> i really feel weird
4984,"<|emo_fear|> Whoa, still remember when that happened? I had the best of starts, but he came back and finished with a shutout "
4985,<|emo_fear|> im feeling really strange
4986,<|emo_fear|> i could feel a little strange doing it right now because i feel a bit shaky
4987,"<|emo_fear|> How does the ""vacuum"" work in practice? Anyone with a video in mind, let me know 😏"
4989,<|emo_fear|> this is so terrifying
4990,<|emo_fear|> i am still kind of shaken but i will not let this happen to anyone because i think it is just so terrible
4991,<|emo_fear|> i do not feel fearful of the world
4992,<|emo_fear|> i feel very helpless as a young black woman
4993,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very indecisive about which book to use for this
4994,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling pretty weird until i got there
4996,<|emo_fear|> >I’m curious as to what your background is
4997,<|emo_fear|> I'm literally shaking right now😫
4998,<|emo_fear|> I’m afraid I’m going to get sick from this
4999,<|emo_fear|> You're just scared
5000,<|emo_fear|> You're ugly
5001,"<|emo_fear|> Ah, so now I'm agitated."
5002,<|emo_fear|> i do believe i could do more to help her than what is in the video
5003,<|emo_fear|> That's worse than a horror story. I hope he is ok.
5004,"<|emo_fear|> A surprising amount of people don't have ""cyst checks"" as it's increasingly understood."
5005,<|emo_fear|> i feel like a hesitant woman right now
5006,<|emo_fear|> i cant help but feel intimidated by the many questions that are being asked
5008,<|emo_fear|> im feeling afraid that these things could destroy everything around us because they are so big
5009,<|emo_fear|> i feeling uncertain and a little more hesitant about
5010,<|emo_fear|> Lol I’m just thinking about what it’s like to be him.
5011,"<|emo_fear|> I think it's even worse, imagine a world where some combination of North Korea, Iran, and Venezuela becomes the dominant power. Those three together would create the most dystopian scenario I can think of. "
5012,<|emo_fear|> Is this the same one with [NAME]? I'm really scared to ask the same thing :(
5013,"<|emo_fear|> Because a) I would have no reason to lie, and b) I'd be ruining everything with my continued existence."
5014,"<|emo_fear|> In my experience, most moms don't get very upset about it. They'll probably just ignore it."
5016,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared by this
5017,<|emo_fear|> i could feel the heat and i felt like i was going to be making a run for it soon
5018,<|emo_fear|> i feel frightened and helpless in front of a green screen
5019,<|emo_fear|> i feel like i should explain but i don t want to make her feel pressured to do anything
5020,<|emo_fear|> im feeling scared and anxious
5022,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little more anxious about the whole project right now
5023,<|emo_fear|> The comment was so terrible. I couldn’t believe it made the final cut.
5024,<|emo_fear|> i feel like i cant help but think these characters are damaged goods
5025,<|emo_fear|> i went to pick up the baby after church and i just feel fearful of that child having to come home to me
5026,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling so nervous about my voice
5027,<|emo_fear|> i remember being frightened of that idea
5028,<|emo_fear|> i find that i m feeling uncertain of my own future
5029,<|emo_fear|> i feel skeptical about the entire thing
5030,<|emo_fear|> i feel nervous as i m in for the checkup that morning
5031,<|emo_fear|> i have to admit though i feel pretty apprehensive at the moment
5032,<|emo_fear|> Omg how dare you.
5033,<|emo_fear|> i was trying to sleep to let my body be more relaxed and i remember feeling a bit nervous
5034,<|emo_fear|> I feel so badly for her. That episode was awful. [NAME] and [NAME] were amazing and heartbreaking.
5035,<|emo_fear|> If you can't defend yourself the people telling you to 'back off' could be dangerous. /s
5036,<|emo_fear|> *losing hope Loose is what she was
5037,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure and wondering even when i am well
5038,<|emo_fear|> In my experience this is actually very common. People who are in relationships of any sort are at a much higher risk for this problem than people who just aren't in relationships at all.
5039,<|emo_fear|> I would be afraid to leave my home alone any longer.
5040,<|emo_fear|> i feel paranoid im nervous
5041,"<|emo_fear|> I feel you, [NAME] is scared out there."
5042,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very indecisive
5043,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure or scared
5044,<|emo_fear|> What a strange twist.
5045,<|emo_fear|> My whole life’s been a lie
5046,<|emo_fear|> Oh my [NAME] I forgot about these
5047,"<|emo_fear|> I was afraid of that too...I was like ""oh no, his head is going to roll"""
5048,<|emo_fear|> i don t want to think she might not be right about everything i know
5050,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling a little shaky
5051,<|emo_fear|> of fear and trepidation
5052,<|emo_fear|> i feel very skeptical about these things
5054,<|emo_fear|> i often feel anxious and out of control when im with a child
5055,<|emo_fear|> The sad part for me is still hopeful. Just not as optimistic as I want.
5056,<|emo_fear|> i feel anxious around him
5057,<|emo_fear|> i think i have been a little reluctant to write because i feel unsure of how i am telling the rest of the story
5058,<|emo_fear|> i still feel hesitant
5059,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling very restless and a little overwhelmed thinking of how i wanted to do my christening this year
5060,<|emo_fear|> i have tried both in case something happens and i feel more paranoid than ever
5061,<|emo_fear|> The cringe is incredible
5062,"<|emo_fear|> I've got some bad news for you. Some good news too, but it's really only good to hear from me first"
5063,<|emo_fear|> i had been feeling quite uncertain about my future
5064,<|emo_fear|> i also remember feeling paranoid
5065,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless but if i did nothing then i bet he wouldnt see my hand reaching into my pocket and pulling out my expensive watch
5066,<|emo_fear|> I'm a parent now and have been for years. Don't scare me. Stay positive and know that your fears are unfounded. Stay strong and stay safe!
5067,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling pressured to make sure i looked good
5068,<|emo_fear|> But it's so much worse to be poor because of government handouts
5069,<|emo_fear|> This will make me the most miserable person on the face of this planet in a few hours.
5070,<|emo_fear|> Oh man. Just horrible.
5071,<|emo_fear|> i think i are afraid to write because it was hard to not feel afraid of saying something in my blog posts
5072,<|emo_fear|> Lol the copypasta is a bummer.
5074,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling a little hesitant about getting this done as i am not used to doing this very often
5075,<|emo_fear|> i feeling so shaky
5077,<|emo_fear|> i was surprised when i saw that it was the same material i used to make them
5078,<|emo_fear|> i start to feel so much less vulnerable
5079,<|emo_fear|> when i saw how he was putting the cat out of its misery by himself
5080,<|emo_fear|> i have never loved or been completely happy with my own parents this is very telling when looking back at those of us who have
5081,"<|emo_fear|> So, no, the police investigation into this thing has not yet determined whether or not the video is shaky."
5082,<|emo_fear|> i feel like a terrified child that no one cares about my feelings
5083,<|emo_fear|> i want people to read this blog but it s a bit overwhelming to deal with because it s so overwhelming i feel terrible
5084,"<|emo_fear|> Ah yes, the terrible ""Dirty Southern Wankers"" band."
5085,<|emo_fear|> im really feeling a bit anxious
5086,<|emo_fear|> i feel nervous for the future of my career
5088,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit terrified
5089,<|emo_fear|> i feel slightly intimidated to find a post for you guys that you all know are really just fantastic artists and have never felt before
5090,<|emo_fear|> I’m scared for y’all who claim to not have encountered this yet:
5091,<|emo_fear|> im feeling quite doubtful but i may be more afraid
5092,<|emo_fear|> i feel like she s afraid she s going to be sick
5093,<|emo_fear|> this is so scary but true lol
5094,<|emo_fear|> Well I'm scared that I'm going to lose 6lbs but I've heard success stories of successful people doing this and it works.
5095,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little apprehensive but i m determined to make it
5096,<|emo_fear|> Your boyfriend is an idiot.
5097,<|emo_fear|> I was about to reply with the same but I'm afraid I'm gonna go ahead and give my least fav. album to next year
5098,<|emo_fear|> i feel overwhelmed feeling restless feeling overwhelmed
5099,<|emo_fear|> ive been working on feeling a little more appreciative of my little abysmal housemate
5100,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little afraid that he might not see the light of day ever again because the way he looks like now is just so horrifying
5101,<|emo_fear|> Because it's scary and everyone thinks its true.
5102,<|emo_fear|> im feeling less skeptical of our future
5103,<|emo_fear|> i didn t feel like a tortured artist
5104,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little paranoid because i want to know all about this first
5105,<|emo_fear|> I'm really scared to find out what kind of thing you could get for breakfast there. You would have to pay extra for it though 😂
5106,<|emo_fear|> i love your username but i read nothing about you and it really makes me feel a little dazed and lost
5107,<|emo_fear|> im feeling quite frightened
5108,<|emo_fear|> i feel like i have a lot to prove but nothing that really frightening
5109,<|emo_fear|> I'm scared for y'all saying there's no proof.
5110,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling incredibly nervous and apprehensive about what to do in the future
5111,<|emo_fear|> The carpool part killed me!
5113,<|emo_fear|> That’s horrible
5114,<|emo_fear|> i had left it feeling a little apprehensive
5115,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little hesitant with the whole thing
5116,<|emo_fear|> i just feel overwhelmed by it all
5118,<|emo_fear|> i am in this state i feel a bit insecure
5119,"<|emo_fear|> My wife: ""I have a minute to talk so I can get a ready for bed drink."" We go off to an addressologist for a minutes before she gives us the ultimatum "
5120,<|emo_fear|> The only thing that is worse is having to ask strangers for money.
5122,"<|emo_fear|> He could hurt you, I don’t know why they don’t use him more."
5123,<|emo_fear|> Is this a real thing? You're right. Scary. I worry that I'll end up with a toothache or worse as my gums get older.
5124,<|emo_fear|> i cant help but feel a little afraid of what is to come
5125,"<|emo_fear|> Well, my wife and I both swear by taking our shoes off the bench before a game because we’d rather have the ball then a terrible team."
5126,<|emo_fear|> i do not feel intimidated by such huge and difficult projects but im feeling skeptical of all the information out there
5127,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling uncertain and unsure who i am and what was my purpose in life
5128,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling very reluctant to get into the office
5129,<|emo_fear|> i had come away feeling doubtful
5130,<|emo_fear|> Is that what she faces? Am I too pathetic to understand?
5131,<|emo_fear|> i feel paranoid feeling anxious
5132,<|emo_fear|> i was just thinking about the feeling of not being in control when something big could have gone terribly wrong and i just gave up feeling like this
5133,<|emo_fear|> > The fact that this is a thing is somehow a problem I don't understand. You're an especially bad troll.
5134,<|emo_fear|> It would be weird but also very real? Imagine being scared as a kid
5135,<|emo_fear|> i just feel uncomfortable
5136,<|emo_fear|> i will tell you i feel kind of weird a
5137,<|emo_fear|> It’s a horrible thing to do to animals. Can’t imagine thinking that’s even slightly palatable.
5138,<|emo_fear|> Because I'm afraid I'll get O+P (ouch for my teeth) and end up worse than O+P
5139,<|emo_fear|> i feel terrified and sad
5141,<|emo_fear|> when i came home i found my father fighting off a legion of centaur
5142,<|emo_fear|> This is sick
5143,<|emo_fear|> I can’t imagine people finding this post funny because of the title.
5144,<|emo_fear|> Damn it [NAME]..
5145,<|emo_fear|> i feel about insecure relationships especially those dating insecure relationships
5146,<|emo_fear|> i thought might be feeling paranoid
5148,<|emo_fear|> i feel so doubtful or even fearful
5149,<|emo_fear|> I did not know a man had gone down that road. I remember one woman coming in screaming for help.
5150,<|emo_fear|> i have been feeling a bit unsure of my confidence right now
5151,<|emo_fear|> i would of told him it wasnt okay to call me that because i am a mommy and his feelings werent hurt
5152,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling suspicious and nervous because everyone was getting a lot of attention around me
5153,<|emo_fear|> im feeling nervous
5154,<|emo_fear|> As a Lions man I have a hard time sympathizing with [NAME]. The whole team is horrible
5155,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling apprehensive about this in the best way possible
5156,<|emo_fear|> i dont want to over do it but i can feel myself being anxious
5157,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling a little vulnerable and fearful
5158,<|emo_fear|> i can feel how apprehensive i am about being in front of a camera
5159,<|emo_fear|> i feel uncomfortable but happy
5160,<|emo_fear|> i think they all feel worried because they ve never had a problem with my safety or yours
5161,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling really reluctant to blog lately because i didnt want people to think im depressed and then take this post as fact about how terrible i am
5162,<|emo_fear|> i feel somewhat fearful
5163,<|emo_fear|> i have a feeling the dm will keep trying to ask me why i feel so fearful about the future
5164,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] who has never given me a doubtful foul twice this century. So much for his defensive abilities.
5165,<|emo_fear|> This is exactly what I meant. I feel so bad for the kids but I wouldn't do anything horrible to them.
5166,<|emo_fear|> i hope you are feeling reassured because it sounds like that is likely the case
5167,<|emo_fear|> That was straight up reckless
5168,<|emo_fear|> i feel nervous yet happy all at the same time
5169,<|emo_fear|> im feeling shaky and shaky just reading this
5170,<|emo_fear|> i am really feeling a little apprehensive about this
5172,<|emo_fear|> It was extremely creepy. Good riddance to awful rubbish.
5173,<|emo_fear|> The first time I actually cried in my room lol
5175,"<|emo_fear|> I hope [NAME] blows up, it would change the destiny of the franchise forever"
5176,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling a bit reluctant to go
5177,<|emo_fear|> i must admit i feel paranoid
5178,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to comment because i have heard so much bad news and been told so many good things about it
5179,<|emo_fear|> You're a monster!
5180,<|emo_fear|> There's something wrong with you.
5181,<|emo_fear|> I hope you’re doing better buddy!!! I’m so sorry you’ve had to deal with all this
5182,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid and i try not to get anxious
5183,<|emo_fear|> The sad part is that it was a year ago now and it's still getting worse.
5185,<|emo_fear|> i feel apprehensive about the new thing
5187,<|emo_fear|> But it’s so creepy
5188,<|emo_fear|> I remember being a kid and loving Scrubs when it first came out. This feels like a nightmare.
5189,<|emo_fear|> You are scary
5191,<|emo_fear|> i am now feeling worried that you are not living up to your word
5192,<|emo_fear|> i can hear the howl of the beasts and feel their call to arms but im afraid to be near the edge or risk staking out this dangerous abode
5193,<|emo_fear|> It was very clear to me that she’s horrible
5195,"<|emo_fear|> It's a terrible fear that can turn into actual, actual paranoia."
5196,<|emo_fear|> i cannot help but feel overwhelmed by a wide variety of emotions
5197,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little overwhelmed with work and want to write more about it
5198,<|emo_fear|> i began to feel paranoid about being around others and the fact that there were people that were close to me
5199,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little stressed out
5200,<|emo_fear|> i feel very unsure why
5201,<|emo_fear|> i feel very scared for my safety
5202,<|emo_fear|> That would be so terrible for her. I’d be so angry for her.
5203,"<|emo_fear|> This is horrible. I just learned that my flair has apparently gone missing, along with many other things "
5204,"<|emo_fear|> It would be even worse than the situation we are currently living in. A socialized approach to mental health, such as the ones we have in Sweden."
5205,<|emo_fear|> i feel extremely reluctant to tell her about it
5206,<|emo_fear|> i feel that these two are afraid of one another and why i feel this way about them
5207,<|emo_fear|> ive not thought about that but i just feel a little scared
5208,<|emo_fear|> i just did not feel pressured for writing this blog post or pressured by the fear of falling into another writer s trap
5209,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling very apprehensive anxious and scared
5210,<|emo_fear|> im feeling somewhat nervous just talking about this
5211,"<|emo_fear|> It's not the end of the world they fear, it's just the beginning."
5212,<|emo_fear|> i could feel myself getting terrified
5213,"<|emo_fear|> Omg, no! NOO HES SO ANGRY"
5214,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless im blind im deaf im insane im blind
5215,<|emo_fear|> I'm feeling afraid for [NAME] right now.
5216,"<|emo_fear|> It's a really creepy ""time machine"""
5217,<|emo_fear|> i feel more sensitive
5218,<|emo_fear|> She has so many reasons to be scared.
5219,"<|emo_fear|> There’s nothing scary about a parent telling you that, it’s just sad. "
5220,<|emo_fear|> i feel agitated as i do these things
5221,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit helpless
5222,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling a little apprehensive about going but i really want to
5223,<|emo_fear|> i just feel really helpless
5224,<|emo_fear|> I just wanted your age report!! Please elaborate.
5225,<|emo_fear|> *pounces on you* ugh
5226,<|emo_fear|> i feel very reluctant to be a mom
5227,<|emo_fear|> i feel like it is dangerous because i do not have a working knowledge of medicine
5228,<|emo_fear|> He could have hurt your eyes...
5229,<|emo_fear|> i was not completely convinced i wanted to do this but finally we came to a place where i could take my mind of some of the horrible things in my own life that i had done
5230,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling very anxious today
5231,<|emo_fear|> i feel overwhelmed by the knowledge of things that i cannot do
5232,"<|emo_fear|> Oh, whoops haha. Not what I meant at all! Glad I’m on my way out soon!"
5233,<|emo_fear|> i just felt vulnerable there
5234,<|emo_fear|> That's scary to know that you went through that.
5235,<|emo_fear|> i said to him feeling nervous
5236,<|emo_fear|> i also feel scared at the fact that i think shes right
5237,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant here
5239,<|emo_fear|> The only way to fight your fear is to live it.
5240,<|emo_fear|> i feel weirdly vulnerable
5241,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant and awkward on this one
5242,<|emo_fear|> i feel so skeptical that i dont trust him
5243,<|emo_fear|> It would be a lot worse if there was a way to turn the switchOFF without the fear of accidentally killing yourself
5244,<|emo_fear|> That sounds awful. Are you with park services now?
5245,<|emo_fear|> Because you never go home
5246,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel shy in the world
5247,<|emo_fear|> This is scary to know that there are people out there that would do this to you.
5248,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling extremely anxious after my last visit
5249,<|emo_fear|> That's horrible
5250,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling nervous
5251,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling so terrified for the whole family
5252,<|emo_fear|> i just feel helpless i cant look out my window at the world
5253,<|emo_fear|> That's not even close to true. These men use them for their own gain and ruin.
5254,<|emo_fear|> I feel personally attacked
5255,<|emo_fear|> You're an awful human being.
5256,<|emo_fear|> i feel so pressured to be perfect and i feel like im not
5258,<|emo_fear|> i had to go into a dark room with a bright light and make a lot of faces to figure out what my purpose was i feel pretty terrified
5259,<|emo_fear|> im feeling uncertain and hesitant
5260,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little paranoid i might have accidentally caused the accident
5261,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite doubtful that all of this will amount to much now
5262,<|emo_fear|> Sooo creepy. Good riddance to awful rubbish in this album
5263,<|emo_fear|> i didn t feel rushed or rushed that day and i started the whole thing off well but it was all still very much a learning experience for me
5264,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] and [NAME] have been getting a lot of attention on the court lately. So much so that I think some opinions are really beginning to bubble up.
5265,<|emo_fear|> When you really think about it... would it really hurt to say that the woman in the photo is his girlfriend?
5266,<|emo_fear|> i feel so dumb for saying that
5267,<|emo_fear|> i feel so overwhelmed and overwhelmed i am a doomed person
5268,<|emo_fear|> I think the worst is saying the same thing so many times it feels like a mantra.
5269,<|emo_fear|> This is the first I've seen of him trying to bully a girl (over whatever)... I wonder if that's a problem?
5270,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling overwhelmed by the time of it all and had to give myself some space to think it through and then we got to the point where the decision had already been made
5271,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling kind of strange about my blogging
5272,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling quite nervous anxious and just a mixture of not enjoying life and wanting to kill stuff
5274,"<|emo_fear|> They say nature makes man feel small. Well, I'm SHOOK."
5275,<|emo_fear|> i just feel totally unsure as to how
5276,"<|emo_fear|> And as a side note, she looked pretty hot that day. "
5277,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure of time and uncertain of my future
5278,<|emo_fear|> i feel completely helpless as my boyfriend is my friend
5279,"<|emo_fear|> Well at some point you have to leave. Your just making it harder so the child will stay, and it just sounds terrible to me."
5280,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im a bit apprehensive to come face to face with the man who has been so unkind as to offer to help me out
5281,<|emo_fear|> im feeling rather skeptical because this is the second time i have called about this issue
5283,<|emo_fear|> We were just horrible friends.
5284,"<|emo_fear|> Oh, the horror."
5285,<|emo_fear|> i honestly cannot begin to imagine the sheer horror you all must bear witness too
5286,<|emo_fear|> i do feel insecure
5287,<|emo_fear|> Not surprising that his stock began to tank upon his hire at the age of 39.
5288,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant to share this one
5289,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling nervous when i left
5290,<|emo_fear|> im feeling so unsure about a lot of things right now
5291,<|emo_fear|> I am scared they will catch or kill me
5292,<|emo_fear|> i feel like a scaredy cat on the terrace after i go to the bathroom
5294,"<|emo_fear|> > They'll look absolutely stunned if they say [NAME]! I mean it, they'll be too embarrassed to come out even if they are."
5295,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling quite overwhelmed
5296,<|emo_fear|> Your mom is very dangerous
5297,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless while supporting myself financially
5298,"<|emo_fear|> It really is. The saddest thing is we don't know what's going to happen because it's all incredibly well thought out and well planned. Sadly, it all comes crashing down in a few days. Poor [NAME]."
5299,<|emo_fear|> im feeling shaky and nauseous already
5300,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid when i m with him
5301,<|emo_fear|> That's weird. What was your last gig like? I would have loved to get a look at that floor.
5302,<|emo_fear|> i started feeling scared and nervous
5303,<|emo_fear|> Because [NAME] is a terrible player. So are [NAME] players :(
5304,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im afraid to be brave
5305,<|emo_fear|> How disgusting. What other jobs would that entail?
5306,<|emo_fear|> How scary. People might be able to protect themselves using products that can't be potentially harmful.
5307,<|emo_fear|> i also want to say that though this is a very frightening time for us and i feel helpless and confused
5308,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little hesitant to show this off because i think it is somewhat cute
5309,<|emo_fear|> i feel very anxious this morning
5310,"<|emo_fear|> A lot of people in this thread are just very angry because the [NAME] are very quiet, but they have very cool products."
5311,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite pressured as i m writing this because i want to say more but im not
5312,<|emo_fear|> im sitting outside on a sunny summer afternoon feeling absolutely terrified because i know exactly where it s going to snow tomorrow
5313,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling a little apprehensive about trying so
5315,<|emo_fear|> im feeling quite afraid for the kids
5316,<|emo_fear|> I can’t imagine the panic they’d be in if they found out he wrote “happy birthday to daddy!”
5317,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little fearful after all
5319,<|emo_fear|> This just made me feel creepy and sad.
5320,<|emo_fear|> i feel paranoid and scared on the inside
5321,<|emo_fear|> The most terrifying thing about this is how much better she looks than him.
5322,<|emo_fear|> i have these sorts of feelings and im reluctant to open up to anyone because i feel somewhat uptight and shut down
5323,<|emo_fear|> i feel pretty overwhelmed right now
5324,<|emo_fear|> Who needs a PhD when you can just chill
5325,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid that i could be wrong
5326,<|emo_fear|> i feel somewhat apprehensive about it
5327,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite overwhelmed by anxiety and worry
5328,<|emo_fear|> i feel extremely skeptical as to whether anything i have written here about any degree of truth
5330,<|emo_fear|> the scary thing about this
5331,<|emo_fear|> i still feel somewhat apprehensive though
5332,<|emo_fear|> That last sentence pains me
5333,<|emo_fear|> How scary and absolutely correct i was to say this. I feel for you...
5336,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant to tell even friends what i feel
5337,"<|emo_fear|> [NAME], this makes me soo uncomfortable "
5338,<|emo_fear|> It's actually worrying that it's still legal.. The fear is that some states are allowing it at will.
5339,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a bit paranoid in my neck hair
5340,<|emo_fear|> i also feel insecure about my work
5341,<|emo_fear|> im feeling more apprehensive
5342,<|emo_fear|> i feel shy about it
5343,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling kind of scared now
5344,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid to leave his arms close enough for him to touch or stroke me because im too afraid to leave him
5345,<|emo_fear|> A guy with a scythe and a big stick scares me the way that monster of old scares me in the Nightmare.
5346,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure of my purpose
5347,<|emo_fear|> Omg i would cry if I were his wife
5348,<|emo_fear|> He's a very dangerous man
5349,"<|emo_fear|> As much as I would love to say otherwise, the reality is that I don't think players will back [NAME] or [NAME] on long-term deals (i am talking 10-12 years). "
5350,<|emo_fear|> You're on brink
5352,<|emo_fear|> I'm scared for y'all saying he said [NAME] before the video
5353,<|emo_fear|> i remember feeling unsure and then feeling glad that hes safe and well
5355,<|emo_fear|> i feel very awkward during the entire lesson
5356,<|emo_fear|> i can just remember the feeling that i had when i was an indecisive child
5357,<|emo_fear|> i feel like they should probably come out more to try to do more with their characters right now but these aren't very sympathetic
5358,<|emo_fear|> I'm scared to ask my mom :(
5359,<|emo_fear|> There used to be this show called You're on fire!!!
5361,<|emo_fear|> i feel insecure thinking about the world as it is
5362,<|emo_fear|> i feel so scared
5363,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling very anxious about going into that book in christchurch after feeling extremely agitated since i came home from college last week
5364,<|emo_fear|> It would be incredibly creepy if we all knew this kept happening...
5366,"<|emo_fear|> Yeah because the threats/ideas he presents are vague and vague, there’s a good chance he’s a loner."
5367,<|emo_fear|> It's even creepier to see them out in the community.
5368,<|emo_fear|> i feeling less paranoid about myself but i still do it
5369,<|emo_fear|> i wasnt feeling scared by the whole situation and was just glad that i didnt have to pull my hair out
5370,<|emo_fear|> im still feeling terrified of the future
5371,<|emo_fear|> i feel more vulnerable than i have in a long time
5372,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a bit uncertain about the whole thing i have put some thought into it and am not trying to place blame on those who werent as lucky as me at the time as i were
5373,<|emo_fear|> i feel very distressed that i want to go back to somewhere when I feel so helpless right now
5374,<|emo_fear|> Because she's a career politician. Aghhgghhh!!!!
5375,<|emo_fear|> i still don t agree at all with what i feel is what she is doing to my body but now even it s not all good
5376,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] was so angry that he cursed [NAME]
5377,"<|emo_fear|> A bit high but I enjoyed it somewhat. Cazed my mum and dad, and it scared them"
5378,"<|emo_fear|> The thing is, it’s creepy."
5379,<|emo_fear|> i am definitely feeling less anxious about going for a walk to feel my health for a day or two and then going to a doctor to get an xray or other kind of checkup
5380,<|emo_fear|> i feel anxious about it
5381,<|emo_fear|> i feel pressured and i get that
5382,<|emo_fear|> Omg stop spamming us
5383,<|emo_fear|> i do feel a little bit reluctant after i do
5384,"<|emo_fear|> The only issue i'm having is that i'm having an awful time with it, isnt that it's horribly hard, is that i'm having a very bad day "
5385,<|emo_fear|> Ahhh so I should know better but is there any way to disable it now? It's ruining my 3DMarkantage performance
5387,<|emo_fear|> i feel nervous wondering about my safety if anyone is actually listening or just going to suddenly appear there
5388,<|emo_fear|> i start to feel so reluctant to actually go
5389,<|emo_fear|> i feel very insecure and paranoid about being around people
5390,<|emo_fear|> I feel terrible for her. I'm so sorry for your friend. #playdespacito
5391,<|emo_fear|> i feel so helpless and in desperate need for help
5392,<|emo_fear|> i have written i feel a little frightened
5393,<|emo_fear|> i would feel really weird and depressed if i had those thoughts
5394,<|emo_fear|> Who is afraid of the black cat? Or the earthquake that shook New Delhi? Both scare the hell out of me!
5395,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid too much
5396,<|emo_fear|> > a lot of people think he's going to hit [NAME] and it's just nonsense.
5397,<|emo_fear|> i feel very apprehensive and anxious about it
5398,<|emo_fear|> I feel for the woman who is caught in the act and faces jail. Just imagine if she is her mother. Imagine doing that to your child.
5399,<|emo_fear|> > he's terrified of flying Oh that's terrifying
5400,<|emo_fear|> i feeling afraid
5401,<|emo_fear|> i can be asked to be a bit longer in public and feel more hesitant about speaking or going about your new experience so i make the most of the opportunity
5402,<|emo_fear|> i did finally read a book of mine that concerned with the subject matter for the first time and i feel a little reluctant to be the first out there in these situations
5403,<|emo_fear|> [NAME]! I was literally on the verge of crying when she came in.
5404,<|emo_fear|> Yeah I just didn’t feel like it
5405,<|emo_fear|> It’s horrifying that in 2016 college students can be arrested for filming police activity. This is the face of lawlessness.
5406,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant to show this to others because i believe it is vulnerable to abuse
5407,<|emo_fear|> i feel very paranoid
5408,<|emo_fear|> Lol don’t be a virgin now
5410,"<|emo_fear|> The thing is, it would be utterly ruinous for the economy, as well as for all involved financially. "
5412,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant to write though at this point i cannot see any way to avoid this
5413,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless and ignorant
5414,<|emo_fear|> i am really not sure now where the idea of telling this story came from and why it does feel so uncomfortable in front of a person my age
5415,<|emo_fear|> My balls shrunk up seeing that
5416,<|emo_fear|> i feel pressured sometimes to do something and i never give in until i feel so helpless
5417,"<|emo_fear|> I am very scared for r/tworedropathas. I hope it works, if it doesn't it's game over for us all :)"
5418,<|emo_fear|> The first comment was a lot more cringe than anything else.
5419,<|emo_fear|> So many good things in that video. And he looks so happy!
5420,<|emo_fear|> I’m afraid I have yet to read any research into how violent a culture is.
5421,<|emo_fear|> i cant help but feel shaken and frightened by it all
5422,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to stop supporting my blog because its what im most passionate about and my blog isnt exactly the place of support for me in life and i dont particularly like the reputation it enjoys
5423,"<|emo_fear|> The creepy ""scarecrow head"" thing is pretty scary."
5424,<|emo_fear|> i feel strange and out of place because i have this new power of suggestion
5425,<|emo_fear|> i feel anxious i see friends but im too scared
5426,<|emo_fear|> I hate that I love him.
5427,<|emo_fear|> i feel more and more isolated which is why i am also reading my thoughts and opinions only through the eyes of someone who is very close to me
5428,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit skeptical and hesitant
5429,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant when it comes to giving money away because i see what they get instead
5433,<|emo_fear|> i can barely feel terrified
5434,<|emo_fear|> You've no idea how devastated I was on Sunday.
5435,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling apprehensive because i couldnt get past the check points and the forms and things that I had to sign in
5436,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared to see who is behind it
5438,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im in an area where im being less careful and hesitant with my words in order to allow me to better deal with what im dealing with and it has caused me great suffering
5439,<|emo_fear|> i often feel shaken up as a child
5440,"<|emo_fear|> > it's also a money grab, and it's not the first time either. It's worse"
5441,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to try other colors
5442,"<|emo_fear|> Your sister was abused, you grew up in a horrible place."
5443,<|emo_fear|> im feeling pretty intimidated by the amount of things i need to do
5445,<|emo_fear|> i just feel scared
5446,<|emo_fear|> It was an ugly 3v3 against New Orleans
5447,<|emo_fear|> I was scared for that black bear
5448,"<|emo_fear|> If they see a green light stick, they automatically get scared, think twice, and move the stick a long ways away. "
5449,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to talk to you
5450,<|emo_fear|> Omg yes! [NAME] is one of my favorite writers and one of my all time favorite authors!
5451,<|emo_fear|> i didnt feel hesitant then and im in the middle of planning my next trip and wouldnt be afraid to ask him in a second to stop asking questions so that i dont miss anything
5452,<|emo_fear|> i dont see a problem with that as well as the fact that it may be a tad bit much to expect her to only want sex from a guy if only he has nice clothes
5453,<|emo_fear|> i feel less afraid
5454,<|emo_fear|> im feeling suspicious but not out of the loop
5455,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] is ugly as all hell.... i just can’t imagine having a player this bad in our league
5456,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] is the only thing keeping me alive. All the rest are just lies and hype.
5457,<|emo_fear|> I wish it was much smaller. Tear it into little bits.
5458,<|emo_fear|> i thought there is such a thing as a good faith compromise but i felt so doubtful
5459,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite nervous
5461,<|emo_fear|> i feel very shy coming out of the bath but i have never in my life come out in such a way where i just have to go to the bathroom and hide
5462,<|emo_fear|> I have seen a lot worse...
5463,<|emo_fear|> i did not feel afraid that i would not get that far
5464,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im being pressured to tell him
5465,<|emo_fear|> i feel so afraid of falling
5466,<|emo_fear|> i feel very uncertain about the direction i wanted the story to take
5467,<|emo_fear|> That video is a prime example that [NAME] can do terrible things
5468,<|emo_fear|> i do wish that i could get a picture taken with her because one moment her stare at the camera and the next i can feel very terrified all while shes looking at me with a smile
5469,<|emo_fear|> i think i will begin to feel a little reluctant about this
5470,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little skeptical for him
5471,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure of myself and unsure of what i am doing at the moment
5472,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling apprehensive but i am not giving up completely yet
5474,<|emo_fear|> i feel uncertain
5475,<|emo_fear|> i feel so hesitant
5476,<|emo_fear|> i feel slightly intimidated to try and write something like this but i dont need to ask
5477,<|emo_fear|> i feel somewhat shaky and nauseous but i m sure it wont last
5479,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little skeptical about the whole thing
5480,<|emo_fear|> i know how it feels to feel a bit pressured
5481,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling extremely fearful and apprehensive today
5482,<|emo_fear|> i started to feel very shaky the first few miles i was hunching over the handle bars and my hands were shaking before i saw the finish line
5484,<|emo_fear|> i am not feeling vulnerable or uncertain or insecure
5485,<|emo_fear|> i feel more hesitant than before
5486,<|emo_fear|> i think it is a combination of my feelings of nervous anticipation and apprehensive interest
5487,<|emo_fear|> i feel very helpless and totally worthless and i really want what is best for me
5488,<|emo_fear|> We are here so that you can come and see and take a look and be inspired by this amazing art piece.
5489,<|emo_fear|> i feel skeptical about every single one of them
5490,<|emo_fear|> I do not care anymore....
5491,<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid to ask but is there a way to un-see it?
5493,<|emo_fear|> He's terrible
5494,<|emo_fear|> i want to tell you all i feel like a nervous wreck and scared to tell you all my feelings
5495,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little nervous about it since i am a big techie and have a lot of free time on my weekends and i want to give all of that time to the school asap but at the same time thats why i want to be there
5496,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite nervous about the entire thing
5497,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im just a target to be threatened by the universe and i think thats the reason for the way i have been able to live this way
5498,<|emo_fear|> i feel kind of shaken up in a weird way
5500,<|emo_fear|> i feel slightly weird writing this as a teacher but i am trying to keep my class centered around my class and doing well
5501,<|emo_fear|> i feel nervous about this
5502,<|emo_fear|> i just am not feeling terrified yet afraid of the world
5503,<|emo_fear|> i feel overwhelmed at what im going through today
5504,<|emo_fear|> The most terrifying thought is she actually has no idea.
5505,<|emo_fear|> i often feel insecure and alone
5506,<|emo_fear|> i can feel hesitant about saying the words to them
5507,<|emo_fear|> That's horrible... I have no words.
5508,<|emo_fear|> i feel apprehensive about doing anything now other than asking for more help because im feeling shaky and not very comfortable in other ways
5509,<|emo_fear|> of course the man himself said something along the lines of “well if you're doing drugs on purpose that's even worse”
5510,<|emo_fear|> i honestly want him to leave feeling terrified
5511,<|emo_fear|> i feel very hesitantly trusting a lot of people online for not having enough experience
5512,<|emo_fear|> i do feel uncertain
5513,<|emo_fear|> This is really scary
5514,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] just had a horrible game. Hard to watch.
5515,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid because it s the only way to avoid getting in a car
5516,<|emo_fear|> This is me all the time.. my anxiety can get the best of me!
5517,<|emo_fear|> i get the feeling that the doctor is expecting a panic attack i will feel very apprehensive for him
5518,<|emo_fear|> It would be creepy.
5519,"<|emo_fear|> Not sure why you think that. Seems pretty crazy, I'm 30 and this would have been a much worse outcome"
5520,<|emo_fear|> I'm so scared as shit
5521,<|emo_fear|> i didn t feel like she was rushed like i did when we walked in
5522,<|emo_fear|> I have to wonder if the school closures with MLK holiday caused her to take her autism more seriously.
5523,"<|emo_fear|> He had, they say. This guy is not an innocent victim!"
5524,<|emo_fear|> i always feel pretty nervous
5525,<|emo_fear|> i feel that every time i think id try to convince people to write songs and be friends and make them feel less afraid
5526,<|emo_fear|> I have. I really want to avoid getting caught in a hail mow down by a truck.
5527,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared and helpless to protect
5528,<|emo_fear|> i feel doubtful for a moment
5529,<|emo_fear|> What a strange thing to say.
5530,<|emo_fear|> i feel extremely insecure of things i am convinced the police have no reason to pursue any
5531,"<|emo_fear|> And if you think that's ""irrational"" then you've been given a horrible education"
5532,<|emo_fear|> It's the only way to make them feel less threatened and more themselves.
5533,<|emo_fear|> i feel kind of anxious anxious about it
5534,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared when we do but i wouldnt tell you theyre not coming
5535,<|emo_fear|> im feeling so afraid
5536,<|emo_fear|> i feel so helpless and hopeless at the same time
5537,"<|emo_fear|> You have to use force to stop them. That, and a good bit of common sense."
5538,<|emo_fear|> This is scary as hell. Good riddance to awful rubbish. :(
5539,<|emo_fear|> i know exactly what i feel and am really terrified
5540,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless when something seems so helpless
5541,<|emo_fear|> i will mention that the way i was feeling was strange
5542,"<|emo_fear|> I wonder if you have kids with them. I'm a young woman and I'm terrified of how it happens, so I'm definitely not looking into it."
5543,"<|emo_fear|> Yeah, this is why I hate on Reddit."
5544,<|emo_fear|> i feel pretty paranoid and anxious and fearful
5545,"<|emo_fear|> There is always a chance that the ""I didn't know"" type of liar could be a psychopath."
5546,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite uncertain and unsure of my purpose here
5547,<|emo_fear|> That's terrifying

5551,<|emo_fear|> i am just feeling very anxious and unsure
5552,<|emo_fear|> im feeling terrified of telling anyone or feeling afraid to tell my parents or her?
5553,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling anxious and stressed and so i wouldnt be surprised if the next time i started going on field tests i was doing it again
5554,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant about doing this at work
5555,"<|emo_fear|> i just told her it was my life, it s my fault she feels the need to be told what to do"
5556,<|emo_fear|> i just feel skeptical about all the work these guys do
5557,<|emo_fear|> Because it's creepy.
5558,<|emo_fear|> i thought would be more of a challenge because it isnt really a big project but i am not quite sure im going to get it done
5559,<|emo_fear|> im feeling more uncomfortable than before
5560,"<|emo_fear|> I was just gonna give you the standard ""I don't like him"" hoo boy."
5561,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant to let go of my feelings of helplessness
5562,<|emo_fear|> i felt scared and helpless
5563,<|emo_fear|> i didnt feel apprehensive
5564,"<|emo_fear|> I'm also scared, and I don't want it to happen to me. Am I in luck today though?"

5566,<|emo_fear|> i remember feeling anxious from this point on
5567,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared as if scared out loud
5568,<|emo_fear|> Not true at all
5569,<|emo_fear|> That [NAME] comment was so terrible. I can’t imagine.
5570,<|emo_fear|> i think i feel less paranoid but i definitely noticed a number of other people that i looked and did what was most surprising to me
5571,<|emo_fear|> It's so sad
5572,<|emo_fear|> I think I might actually just be scared to look at it
5573,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling pretty reluctant to let go
5574,<|emo_fear|> That is disturbing
5575,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling quite restless with little else to look forward to
5577,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling paranoid and anxious
5578,"<|emo_fear|> ""Bing"" is a terrible enough word to describe his voice actors!"
5579,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very uncertain about the future of the world right now
5580,<|emo_fear|> i feel like a confused kid
5581,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling afraid because i didnt know what the fuck to do
5583,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared and uncertain but i should be
5584,<|emo_fear|> But it's so hideous
5586,<|emo_fear|> I also feel the need to apologize for any confusion or misunderstanding this may have caused.
5587,<|emo_fear|>  You're a freak
5588,<|emo_fear|> The “berliner” part scared me away. But now I’m like “oh my gosh this thing”.
5589,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im helpless because im worried im stupid
5590,<|emo_fear|> i feel like i m being tortured by these thoughts of not being here in this time of need

5606,<|emo_fear|> i feel pretty terrified for her
5607,<|emo_fear|> Omg! I couldn't keep watching! Is this a real thing?! c'mon you mama!
5608,<|emo_fear|> This happened to me once and it's still haunt me to this day.
5609,"<|emo_fear|> No, no one can make me feel scared"
5610,<|emo_fear|> A lot of people don't get caught because they hide their guns behind bushes and buildings.
5612,<|emo_fear|> Not a good advice but im more concerned with making yourself look worse than than you actually are if you are reading this.
5613,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im really trusting too much but sometimes my life is scary and i feel trusting in myself
5614,<|emo_fear|> im feeling quite shaken up by the whole thing
5615,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant about it
5616,<|emo_fear|> Because what she said is wrong and you should be more worried about someone spreading hate than a mad apple
5617,<|emo_fear|> i feel extremely insecure and uncomfortable in those surroundings
5618,<|emo_fear|> im feeling less fearful for my safety
5621,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling very anxious when i sat down to write this

5628,<|emo_fear|> That’s so creepy. Good riddance to awful rubbish.
5629,"<|emo_fear|> The only worse thing about this is the kid who was the last person to react, he looks like [NAME]"
5630,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared and sad looking at the stars
5631,<|emo_fear|> The third picture is creepy.

5634,<|emo_fear|> i feel nervous if i let it
5635,<|emo_fear|> im feeling frightened im moving back and forth between my home and work and im trying to remember to take care of myself
5636,<|emo_fear|> I'm a little apprehensive beforehand because I know people who've done it before. I'm a lot more reassured after watching it.

5639,<|emo_fear|> i feel very helpless about this
5640,<|emo_fear|> i feel anxious about going outside

5646,<|emo_fear|> Whataburger misses you
5647,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to take part in this so i will just continue to watch and wait until it goes to a commercial
5648,<|emo_fear|> i woke up and noticed my ears feeling a bit funny
5649,<|emo_fear|> i didnt think i would be feeling so uncertain about my future

5671,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little vulnerable
5672,<|emo_fear|> i am so insecure im trying to control what i say and do

5728,<|emo_fear|> i don t know how people feel that the cops who shot and killed my dad can be any worse than most of yall

5891,<|emo_fear|> i feel very helpless at this point
5892,<|emo_fear|> i feel skeptical of everything seems uncertain everywhere im afraid there will be a mistake i never mean to commit in my life
5893,<|emo_fear|> That’s a terrible take.
5894,"<|emo_fear|> The only thing worse then that,is' having to train at gunpoint by a group of strangers."
5895,<|emo_fear|> i hope you will not feel left out

5901,<|emo_fear|> i hope to find my way back and i feel less terrified about that
5902,<|emo_fear|> i feel very reluctant to go back
5904,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very vulnerable today and feeling very isolated
5905,<|emo_fear|> The way you worded that made me want to slap you
5906,<|emo_fear|> What a horrifying picture.
5907,<|emo_fear|> i remember feeling apprehensive about it
5908,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling anxious because i didn t know what was transpiring
5909,<|emo_fear|> I did the same exact thing I keep hearing is scary :D
5910,<|emo_fear|> i feel more hesitant to sign for a class because my eyes are on the exam
5911,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little bit terrified
5912,<|emo_fear|> im feeling really nervous and fearful that i ve doomed to lose a limb and have my sense of self totally devastated
5913,<|emo_fear|> i feel terrified of being found out
5914,<|emo_fear|> i feel less reluctant to go to a second hearing about her past and the circumstances that surround it
5915,<|emo_fear|> i was sitting there on the couch reading what i had on monday night at dinner feeling like a tortured hobo because things hadnt exactly been well on monday afternoon
5916,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling a little apprehensive as i go through these steps
5917,"<|emo_fear|> What's scary is that we still have this ""if it isn't [NAME] it is [NAME]"" mentality in this country."
5919,<|emo_fear|> i feel anxious when i dont understand how a car works and how a building works
5920,<|emo_fear|> i feel shaken up and sad and angry all at the same time at the same time
5921,<|emo_fear|> i always feel suspicious and it s even more terrible when im the least bit worried
5922,"<|emo_fear|> There's a bit more serious side to that story though. She said she knew the officer when she met him, but she had ""no romantic attraction""."
5923,<|emo_fear|> When did I go 1/10? And that drop is still impressive
5924,<|emo_fear|> You sound scared
5925,<|emo_fear|> I’m very afraid of exactly this happening to me.
5926,<|emo_fear|> This is so creepy!
5927,"<|emo_fear|> Well what an obnoxious, drunk girl. "
5928,<|emo_fear|> im a little apprehensive about the whole thing especially since i feel a little bit like there are a few of the folks that you will contact that are skeptical of the whole concept
5929,<|emo_fear|> i feel more afraid of my skin than my brother
5930,<|emo_fear|> They're just scared of the press
5931,<|emo_fear|> im feeling rather paranoid tonight
5932,<|emo_fear|> I just can’t imagine who [NAME] is as a father. He’s a fantastic dad. I really hope he does a series of shows for the awareness and raising awareness about his condition. That’s so important.
5933,<|emo_fear|> This makes me so nervous. I really hope there are no more affected by these measles cases.
5934,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very indecisive right now
5935,<|emo_fear|> i feel slightly scared with what we ve been taught
5936,<|emo_fear|> im not feeling too hot or cold or just overall gloomy but with the exception of rain i expect my humidity to be in the upper 70%
5937,"<|emo_fear|> Oh [NAME], oh no, no no no no"
5938,<|emo_fear|> im feeling more and more unsure about how to end my life
5939,"<|emo_fear|> I'm still kind of scared as all hell, though."
5940,<|emo_fear|> >and it's getting a lot worse. Yep Yep Yep Yep 
5941,<|emo_fear|> i feel that im a little bit paranoid but there is no reason to be
5942,"<|emo_fear|> And the worse part is, the sooner this gets handled the sooner/worse this will become known to you all."
5943,"<|emo_fear|> Who cares? They're just worried about the money, ok?"
5944,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling nervous about my first day at work but i knew if i didn t do well im sure it would get worse and worse
5945,<|emo_fear|> That was so awkward.
5946,<|emo_fear|> i feel this is a fearful sign that we are moving on in the right direction and that it is a sign that god in general is supporting us more consistently in the faith and giving us the love that we need
5947,<|emo_fear|> That's terrible. I'm so sorry for your loss. Stay strong!
5949,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel as terrified
5950,<|emo_fear|> That's why I'm glad we have [NAME] who's on our team instead of [NAME].
5952,<|emo_fear|> My mother has been telling me about these supposed ghosting effects. It makes my arms and hands hurt.
5954,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid to let go of the things that used to keep me terrified
5955,<|emo_fear|> I feel for people who do these things. Thats so sad!
5956,<|emo_fear|> im feeling pretty anxious for a good week after I go back to school
5958,<|emo_fear|> i dont know how i feel its strange
5959,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite skeptical of the accuracy of all of their information
5960,<|emo_fear|> i didn t feel apprehensive when i went to check in
5961,<|emo_fear|> i feel really scared to ask why he is so brave
5962,"<|emo_fear|> How scary is it that they'll just close the school and put all of our kids into homeschools, especially when there are plenty of good kids in there? That’s awful."
5963,<|emo_fear|> This is so scary but true. Scary at the same time it's not a terrible thing to do.
5964,<|emo_fear|> My worst fear is catching mumps and contractions
5965,<|emo_fear|> i feel very insecure and uncertain and also scared
5966,"<|emo_fear|> It was a horrible, horrible thing to do. He did everything he could until he died."
5967,<|emo_fear|> i feel really insecure sometimes even when nothing happens
5968,<|emo_fear|> This is frightening.
5970,<|emo_fear|> i could feel myself getting a little agitated
5971,<|emo_fear|> In the worst case scenario you'd have them arresting and possibly putting them on trial for murder.
5972,<|emo_fear|> i feel so much fear that god will send me away when he finds out
5973,<|emo_fear|> im not sure how it feels to be afraid of someone who has nothing to do against the rest if you look at the world from this light
5974,<|emo_fear|> i started feeling frantic and then just relaxed
5975,<|emo_fear|> i had been feeling a bit uncomfortable but it was mostly in my throat and chest
5976,"<|emo_fear|> I’m not afraid of dying myself, but I can’t imagine living a life of constant fear and anxiety."
5977,<|emo_fear|> That was a horrible call
5978,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] was also terrible last season. Don't be surprised if he tank this season.
5979,<|emo_fear|> i feel completely apprehensive about it
5980,"<|emo_fear|> You were too afraid to be out there, [NAME]! *sobbing uncontrollably*"
5981,"<|emo_fear|> That's awful. But yeah, people are a weird lot.."
5982,"<|emo_fear|> I mean, it's still creepy"
5983,<|emo_fear|> i really have no reason to believe that this is entirely my fault because i feel so helpless
5984,<|emo_fear|> So so good
5985,<|emo_fear|> i feel extremely intimidated and out of place at times
5986,<|emo_fear|> They're saying the same exact thing? Wtf?
5987,"<|emo_fear|> He's older and his response to someone telling him they are too stupid to get into dating is to laugh and say ""oh well just take this"""
5988,<|emo_fear|> Ahhhh. Damn.
5989,<|emo_fear|> You are quite horrible.
5990,<|emo_fear|> i do feel a bit of nervous about it
5991,<|emo_fear|> Oh [NAME]...
5992,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling apprehensive and nervous
5993,<|emo_fear|> i hate feeling like she s terrified
5994,<|emo_fear|> i would have to feel fearful or suspicious
5995,<|emo_fear|> i feel like i m a reluctant girl to let go
5996,<|emo_fear|> i would be scared for him
5997,<|emo_fear|> i feeling a bit more insecure because no one would interview me
5998,<|emo_fear|> im feeling quite apprehensive and nervous about coming back to scotland
5999,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very apprehensive about the whole thing
6000,<|emo_fear|> i did not feel as terrified as when i first met her in late october
6001,<|emo_fear|> i can t help feeling a little apprehensive about the future
6002,<|emo_fear|> i feel paranoid about myself
6003,"<|emo_fear|> As bad as [NAME] was to Toronto, I think he handled it pretty well tbh."
6004,<|emo_fear|> I'm seeing strange redditors today
6005,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little uncertain about how best to approach this
6006,<|emo_fear|> ~~worrying~~ people can die from polio
6007,<|emo_fear|> i felt terrified and helpless i began to lose hope and sense of purpose as i watched her lose the weight and lose the confidence of her friends
6008,"<|emo_fear|> I feel terrible for him, but the saddest thing is I wish we had [NAME] in this picture."
6009,<|emo_fear|> i woke up feeling unsure
6010,"<|emo_fear|> I'm not surprised! He was terrible the first few years, went from strength coach to strength coach, lost his sleep and is still horrible."
6011,"<|emo_fear|> I wonder if a lot of these pictures are illegal, and how that might possibly impact my ability to have a job in the future."
6012,<|emo_fear|> This is creepy and sadder than [NAME] and [NAME]. I’m so very sorry that happened to you. I hope you have moved on.
6013,<|emo_fear|> i start with feeling helpless and hopeless and then i remember some cool bits and pieces from the world in history like phelps lego from the little bang we live in
6014,<|emo_fear|> This is so scary to know that you went through that. I hope you are doing better now. ❤
6015,<|emo_fear|> i cant do something that would make you feel distressed like that that makes you think that this is true
6016,<|emo_fear|> I'm scared I might get winded
6017,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite shy
6018,<|emo_fear|> Ah what a terrible list
6019,<|emo_fear|> i have this kind of a fear of feeling too afraid to be afraid
6020,"<|emo_fear|> My fault for being a human being, not an animal"
6021,<|emo_fear|> i know there is a lot of fear in those situations but im not feeling that way i dont feel scared by the situation
6023,<|emo_fear|> i have always been afraid i would be like whiny bird but lately i feel very reassured by my decision to go outside
6024,"<|emo_fear|> I find it really hard to imagine a society that treats pedophiles this way, yet that's what our society has unfortunately become."
6030,<|emo_fear|> im feeling fearful of having to come here again like yesterday like i was
6031,<|emo_fear|> The real horror is running from a psycho
6033,<|emo_fear|> im feeling kind of anxious about it all
6034,<|emo_fear|> This is a good point - I'm sad that they are against private land but there's no need to build a megafortress with guard rails to keep the bears away.
6035,"<|emo_fear|> When I had a serious illness that forced me to work for almost nothing, that was far worse."
6036,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared and helpless
6037,<|emo_fear|> i feel very little and yet worried about a great lot
6038,<|emo_fear|> It was more annoying than anything.
6039,<|emo_fear|> I'm [RELIGION] and I'm terrifying
6040,<|emo_fear|> i have to take a moment now and remember that the world is far greater and stranger than what we know so our world will look a lot different when we die
6041,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little pressured to get this finished but im not sure how to make it better
6042,<|emo_fear|> I'm scared I'll lose a stone over the summer...
6043,<|emo_fear|> i still can t believe you took this relationship seriously
6045,"<|emo_fear|> i feel a little weird saying ""hug"""
6046,<|emo_fear|> i have been feeling quite apprehensive about how much i feel about my future
6047,"<|emo_fear|> I fear the worst. Some day [NAME] will turn against us and decide to go back home, but so far I feel the least optimistic about it."
6048,<|emo_fear|> Oh my word. She was terrible... I felt for her. I’ve come to terms with it now.
6050,<|emo_fear|> It's the same shit-post you made about the same [NAME] guy.
6051,<|emo_fear|> i feel anxious because my job is to be there and if it happens it won t be good news for me
6052,<|emo_fear|> She also has a weird relationship with her mouth.
6053,<|emo_fear|> i feel more fearful that the people im trusting are not themselves honest
6054,<|emo_fear|> im already feeling restless
6055,"<|emo_fear|> In case it somehow goes well, I'm going to be making that change asap. "
6056,<|emo_fear|> i feel anxious and scared to meet him
6058,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling a little apprehensive as i waited for the driver
6059,<|emo_fear|> i would feel quite doubtful
6060,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] was the only thing standing between us and an earthquake that would utterly destroy us all.
6061,<|emo_fear|> It looks like my nightmare. A 3D printed penis.
6062,<|emo_fear|> im not going to lie i was feeling a little scared about the whole thing after hearing about this situation but now im feeling pretty hopeful excited and excited about all these possibilities
6063,"<|emo_fear|> A man wearing women's clothes, with a beard, scares me just thinking about it..."
6064,<|emo_fear|> It’s so creepy. Good riddance maybe I could care less 😂
6065,<|emo_fear|> I wonder why your mom is so mad.
6067,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared of how much i can protect myself
6068,<|emo_fear|> i feel very insecure i have never told my parents
6069,<|emo_fear|> i know this is my fault but im a little nervous because i dont know what to say
6070,<|emo_fear|> i feel frightened just thinking about it
6071,<|emo_fear|> I remember sitting at home one day and my cat started laying on my lap while I looked on in horror.
6073,<|emo_fear|> i dont like to walk alone i can do with the help of car but i feel too timid to do it
6074,<|emo_fear|> i feel agitated like i should be spending more time with my family and less time being in college
6075,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little apprehensive but i m determined to see it through
6076,<|emo_fear|> i started to feel anxious that i would pass out tomorrow night
6077,<|emo_fear|> im also feeling very indecisive on what to do about the whole house for the rest of my term
6078,<|emo_fear|> i always feel suspicious and question the veracity of any information i receive
6079,"<|emo_fear|> > And they did enjoy their lives In case you missed it, the show did end up being horrible for [NAME] too."
6080,<|emo_fear|> i feel so insecure to even be around people that i often end up following them that whole distance
6081,<|emo_fear|> So many people will think [NAME] is a creep.
6082,<|emo_fear|> i feel suspicious too
6083,<|emo_fear|> i can feel helpless
6084,<|emo_fear|> i get that when the body starts feeling more vulnerable than others it might be time to let it go a little easier on the body
6085,<|emo_fear|> i feel kind of strange just being around you guys
6086,<|emo_fear|> The more you learn the more disturbing it gets for you
6087,<|emo_fear|> i had to put on my clothes and feel extremely uncomfortable before i even walked through the door
6088,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling a little skeptical about starting this but im really not feeling anxious
6089,<|emo_fear|> I had so many friends in high school but nothing like this...I'm just a lonely nobody..
6090,<|emo_fear|> But I'm afraid it's probably just a scammer.
6091,<|emo_fear|> ive done two weeks of what seems to be three days but i m feeling reluctant
6092,<|emo_fear|> i feel so overwhelmed and frustrated with the lack of attention and love and support
6093,<|emo_fear|> i feel overwhelmed the more i feel like im on the verge of forgetting everything that is good about living
6094,<|emo_fear|> i feeling nervous about it
6096,<|emo_fear|> i cant help but feel doubtful
6097,<|emo_fear|> i feel so scared to tell them what im going to do because thats what most women feel when theyre 18
6098,<|emo_fear|> i know that my husband feels anxious and concerned for me
6099,<|emo_fear|> i feel more insecure and afraid out of everyone around me
6100,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling skeptical
6101,<|emo_fear|> i started the morning feeling intimidated but i am not afraid
6102,"<|emo_fear|> [NAME]? What is he doing there? He just lost to the Hawks on opening night, so he must hate the Lakers "
6103,"<|emo_fear|> I’m with you, pulju has been horrible so far"
6104,<|emo_fear|> He is afraid to be around his own children
6105,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little unsure about
6107,<|emo_fear|> We are living in some horrible time
6108,<|emo_fear|> i feel uncertain about my future
6109,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] fucking [NAME] please no
6110,<|emo_fear|> i feel very reluctant about talking to my manager about this
6111,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] has the puck on his stick constantly and is playing on the breakaways way too much. It’ll be hard to keep him when he’s on.
6112,<|emo_fear|> That woman looks like a rape victim. Not to mention that the dress was black.
6113,"<|emo_fear|> When she saw how upset [NAME] was, that made her so obviously distraught and afraid to speak to anyone again. /s"
6114,<|emo_fear|> i didnt say i was terrified what i said i didnt say im in pain i dont feel afraid
6115,<|emo_fear|> i feel nervous and unsure what will come of my trip
6116,<|emo_fear|> It’s creepy
6117,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling anxious about being out of work the past couple of days
6118,<|emo_fear|> Omg [NAME] stop broadcasting your show
6119,<|emo_fear|> A woman telling a man his life must be miserable is creepy and abuse.
6120,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to give it a chance
6121,<|emo_fear|> My worst fear is catching fire
6122,<|emo_fear|> i feel very reluctant to have a name for my blog because my name is eli but im actually really grateful for the opportunity to put it out there
6123,<|emo_fear|> The face tattoo...it's horrid.
6124,<|emo_fear|> i can feel apprehensive about trusting the watchers
6125,<|emo_fear|> im feeling pretty scared to get anything done today
6126,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling really overwhelmed with everything that we have to do the past few days
6127,<|emo_fear|> i know that i am feeling anxious and worried about my school work
6128,<|emo_fear|> when my cat jumped into my leg to show he had a fever
6129,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit intimidated or overwhelmed
6130,<|emo_fear|> i feel terrified a
6131,"<|emo_fear|> As much as people like [NAME] hate [NAME], he did do something good for us."
6133,<|emo_fear|> I always feel a little bit creepy around animals
6134,<|emo_fear|> im feeling afraid to go to school but my parents have assured me i must not let any worries affect my performance in the school field
6135,<|emo_fear|> i feel anxious about the prospect of trying to play sport again because it has become a sport of one thing
6136,<|emo_fear|> i wasnt feeling very fearful
6137,<|emo_fear|> Damn...I think I see cheekbones!
6138,<|emo_fear|> of COURSE!! and she’s a MILf!!
6139,<|emo_fear|> Is this [NAME]? I'm afraid we got him wrong but at least he'll never have the chance to hurt you again.
6140,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] was a guy that played catch-up defensively for a long time and was often abused by our bigger (and more physical) brethren.
6141,<|emo_fear|> She was wearing heels and had been out in a car accident.
6142,<|emo_fear|> i didnt want to hear it but honestly i feel scared if it d be true
6143,<|emo_fear|> im feeling nervous about it
6144,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] what a psycho.
6146,<|emo_fear|> Oh my gosh! They didn't grow up with guns...
6147,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling quite scared
6148,<|emo_fear|> This is horrifying. She's only 45 and she's already a terrible president.
6149,<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid I'll pick something else. There are far too many terrible memes to choose from.
6150,"<|emo_fear|> oh, my gosh"
6151,"<|emo_fear|> A little boy, a very frightened little girl. It's not hard to imagine that they were having an encounter with some supernatural force."
6152,<|emo_fear|> i feeling a bit anxious but i dont give up
6153,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] should be afraid of flying
6154,<|emo_fear|> i see the way she looks i feel afraid
6155,<|emo_fear|> I'd just scare my dog
6156,<|emo_fear|> My nightmare is having an iphone.
6157,<|emo_fear|> i feel weird about it
6158,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling apprehensive about it and worried that i couldnt use it
6159,<|emo_fear|> i feel very reluctant to go alone i feel scared
6160,<|emo_fear|> And I cried more here than in Star Wars.
6161,<|emo_fear|> i feel like it is at least indecipherable
6162,<|emo_fear|> i thought i was going mad or something when i got home from college and went into my room feeling anxious
6163,<|emo_fear|> i remember feeling scared
6164,"<|emo_fear|> I'm kinda afraid to post my true feelings, but here they are nonetheless..."
6165,"<|emo_fear|> That's bad, maybe he was afraid people would get past him and come back to him."
6166,<|emo_fear|> i also feel vulnerable to getting hurt from it
6167,<|emo_fear|> i could stop feeling helpless if i could stop being so worried about how much is going to hit my head
6168,<|emo_fear|> i was going to read the title i was feeling anxious
6169,<|emo_fear|> i am afraid to be seen as a woman and feel so embarrassed in front of my fellow women
6170,<|emo_fear|> i dont know how i feel about my friends and family that doesnt know i love them
6171,<|emo_fear|> i feel more afraid
6172,<|emo_fear|> You need to be more specific and say are you seeing or hearing auras.
6173,<|emo_fear|> >[NAME] is still extremely dumb but he seems pretty open to accepting his mistakes
6174,<|emo_fear|> im a little bit terrified for those close friends of mine or family and im feeling less reluctant to let them down
6175,<|emo_fear|> This picture gives me chills.
6176,<|emo_fear|> The poor bird!
6177,<|emo_fear|> i do know is that i cannot feel afraid or uncertain in anyway
6178,<|emo_fear|> i have been feeling a little bit overwhelmed at times as i try to do all the things i think i need to do in my life and it has drained me of energy
6179,"<|emo_fear|> Oh good lord, now I am scared to even approach them."
6180,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure and uncertain about my directions and it gets worse
6181,<|emo_fear|> i feel a curious mnemonic shift happening as the days go by
6183,<|emo_fear|> i feel kinda dumb this morning
6184,<|emo_fear|> that is how i was abused both physically and mentally by my father
6185,"<|emo_fear|> I was wondering this too. Cried when she says [NAME], but I was also wondering if she was reading [NAME]."
6186,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared when i know just a few people are listening
6187,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling reluctant and a bit overwhelmed
6188,<|emo_fear|> i would feel nervous to meet any of these people
6189,<|emo_fear|> This is scary to know that your age difference is that you're dating someone 30.
6190,<|emo_fear|> i feel weird sitting in the back of school when the other kids go to the pool but am glad to come home on my own
6191,"<|emo_fear|> The guy that died didnt even flinch, that is terrifying. "
6192,<|emo_fear|> The weirdest thing about this is how many different companies have their offices in New York City.
6193,<|emo_fear|> i feel more vulnerable these days
6194,<|emo_fear|> How incredibly scary.
6195,<|emo_fear|> i also feel terrified by the future
6196,<|emo_fear|> i started feeling scared for caleb because the last few years he has been amazing to work with
6197,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little anxious or just something need to be done but i probably need to get into the act of writing because it takes more time than i thought it might
6198,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared to ask
6200,<|emo_fear|> i feel weird about going outside in the cold
6201,<|emo_fear|> He is a danger to himself and others
6202,"<|emo_fear|> I'm scared, I don't know what to do next"
6203,<|emo_fear|> i feel less nervous about it
6204,"<|emo_fear|> So you're a vile, disgusting person, you deserve what you deserve."
6205,<|emo_fear|> i feel uncomfortable as i look at the pictures of it from before i left for sask
6206,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid that the people i care about know about all this
6207,<|emo_fear|> i think it is important to say clearly what i am feeling about the whole situation
6208,<|emo_fear|> Lol just get him drunk that way [NAME] is the worst
6209,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling skeptical about our ability to make them happy
6210,<|emo_fear|> I feel personally killed by [NAME].
6211,<|emo_fear|> This is so chill! I felt the same way and i hate it
6212,<|emo_fear|> im feeling more indecisive
6213,<|emo_fear|> i feel nervous that im going to be wrong and that im not going to see the light
6215,<|emo_fear|> i feel skeptical of some of the conclusions i have to say im impressed with this research
6216,<|emo_fear|> i get angry when i feel that there are people like me
6218,<|emo_fear|> They do! What a nightmare.
6219,<|emo_fear|> i had a feeling was that i would be apprehensive at the doctor s office
6220,"<|emo_fear|> In other words, I had a terrible experience on CTF4 but I went out of my way to avoid suffering the fate I did in H1. Hope this helps you on your journey. "
6221,<|emo_fear|> I'm just worried that [NAME] doesn't want to go there and that he won't want [NAME] there if his heart says go.
6222,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little bit intimidated at the fact that i should be able to do this

6233,<|emo_fear|> im feeling so uncertain and afraid
6234,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling anxious and nervous and worried and i needed to get on my way or else i would have never left the scene

6236,"<|emo_fear|> ""We're scared of some sort of attack or something"" - often times this is not true. Also the idea of someone using a gun in a school isn't that novel."
6237,<|emo_fear|> i love this but i feel like it takes a while to get used to it
6238,"<|emo_fear|> That's your take? I have no idea what he is talking about and, if he misread this, it's terrible."
6239,<|emo_fear|> i know is that it does not stop me from feeling paranoid like i need to go through therapy like with my dad
6240,<|emo_fear|> He's afraid to leave the house
6241,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling very indecisive
6242,<|emo_fear|> As a Ducks fan that was kinda sad to see. :(

6244,<|emo_fear|> i started feeling apprehensive on how i was going to go about those things
6245,<|emo_fear|> She looks old! Way to young for that.
6247,<|emo_fear|> She looks like she was made to have a horrifically painful vagina (notably because she lived happily ever after).
6248,<|emo_fear|> im on a bike for a long distance run and feeling a bit shaky
6249,<|emo_fear|> There was a horrible accident and now he's dead

6253,<|emo_fear|> I actually feel so insecure on my bike.
6254,<|emo_fear|> i just feel too stubborn and self centered
6255,<|emo_fear|> of a man
6257,<|emo_fear|> What a cruel thing to say to someone with depression lol.
6258,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little nervous as i read this

6272,<|emo_fear|> i think i m going to feel vulnerable that day
6273,"<|emo_fear|> Just look at that body, what a freak."
6274,<|emo_fear|> i have to admit what happened today is really scary for me just being afraid
6275,<|emo_fear|> i hope that you feel the pain and suffering you felt with your parents this morning as you were most likely traumatized in their wake
6276,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling really shaky and almost walked from the bathroom down the hall there was one person that didnt care which was a lovely surprise to be honest

6285,<|emo_fear|> i can feel myself getting a bit distracted
6286,<|emo_fear|> This is the saddest thing I've seen on reddit this week. She could save up to buy a home for her family in Jersey and move to Florida. This is just so heart breaking.

6288,<|emo_fear|> i feel doubtful again
6289,<|emo_fear|> i feel so anxious anxious and overwhelmed because im supposed to be able to give the kids something to do without any input from me

6291,<|emo_fear|> i have not lost an arm or hand in any accident in the last ten years i feel very hopeless
6293,<|emo_fear|> i went back to feeling uncertain about everything

6313,<|emo_fear|> i could feel my heart race like a panicked cat so frantic i could feel it just before it dropped into the pit
6315,<|emo_fear|> i feel so terrified for my children that i didnt even think about calling the police
6316,<|emo_fear|> the way i feel about this world has changed a lot

6324,<|emo_fear|> Oh I hate you for making me read this

6333,<|emo_fear|> This is worse than a horror movie. The only good thing about this is it's horrifying and endearing at the same time.
6334,<|emo_fear|> It’s weird because I thought it was normal to have those dreams?
6335,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite apprehensive about it
6336,"<|emo_fear|> [NAME] isn't bad, he just needs to start getting it done more frequently and consistently."

6352,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] just made some awful calls during the year.. the frustration got to me a lot.
6353,<|emo_fear|> That’s the saddest thing I’ve read on here so far. So many people seem very happy with their lives and seem to care about other people’s.
6354,<|emo_fear|> It's not about [NAME] but it definitely is. I don't like going to far away games or seeing the crowd on the other end.
6356,<|emo_fear|> I don't miss [NAME]. :(
6357,<|emo_fear|> i feel fearful anxious just before i set off
6358,"<|emo_fear|> What a weird thing to say, but I’m gonna try to use it a bit if I have the time "

6367,<|emo_fear|> i must say i do feeling a bit nervous about it
6368,<|emo_fear|> i can t explain to people how great it feels to be uncertain
6369,<|emo_fear|> i feel apprehensive because i didnt have a good sense of why this was going to happen again and didnt feel trusting or supportive
6370,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure because of them
6371,<|emo_fear|> i feel really timid
6373,"<|emo_fear|> It's probably best to not alarm them. Just say it, and they can go about their day uneventfully."
6374,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little hesitant to pick another story
6375,<|emo_fear|> i feel fearful that i had an inadequate preparation
6376,<|emo_fear|> i feel kind of strange and helpless and completely useless

6381,<|emo_fear|> I'm terrified!
6382,<|emo_fear|> i want to say is that i feel doubtful because i have reason to believe that there are worse things than death the loss of a loved friend and even the loss of a friend for a short time.

6384,<|emo_fear|> i just feel skeptical about it

6387,<|emo_fear|> When it's all said and done I won't be impressed and will probably want to downvote your comment.
6388,<|emo_fear|> i see him on these days when i feel the least bit unsure if life is what it is or if i am just too stupid to live in hope and hope is not the answer
6389,"<|emo_fear|> When [NAME] saw [NAME] and [NAME] playing, he was like what the hell. This is the most dangerous team this league has ever seen."
6390,<|emo_fear|> i had been feeling quite apprehensive about walking down the street any night after the holidays
6391,<|emo_fear|> i remember feeling intimidated by it
6392,"<|emo_fear|> My girlfriend with BPD started talking about it and it became a bigger and bigger thing in my head since she's the one who is always like ""all of the above blah blah"""

6402,"<|emo_fear|> Well.. if you're a woman, chances are that you wouldnt have any say, and even less protection from men, no matter how much you might want them to. It's a completely horrifying world we live in."
6403,"<|emo_fear|> [NAME], who I suppose is a ""gun nut"" but has a ""sincere"" concern for his loved ones situation is definitely a ""no."" "

6756,<|emo_fear|> i feel so insecure but i think that is actually more my own fault
6757,<|emo_fear|> I'm a big [NAME] fan. I think if [NAME] were alive he would want her canonically killed to keep [NAME] from haunting her.

6809,<|emo_fear|> Holy crap that was fucking bad...
6810,<|emo_fear|> i would then ask him if he liked to try some sorts of home made vegan cheese out himself and he would usually say no but he then probably started off feeling reluctant and wondered why he should make it harder for me

6818,<|emo_fear|> Yeah sounds terrible. I'm very sorry for your experience. Stay safe!
6819,<|emo_fear|> My mom is almost always right. Sometimes she's wrong and sometimes she is. I always look forward to her explaining her thinking.

6826,<|emo_fear|> That face is so terrifying
6827,<|emo_fear|> i dont love the feeling of being terrified
6828,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling pretty skeptical about the results
6829,<|emo_fear|> I’m scared for bud
6830,<|emo_fear|> i didn t feel skeptical about it until i realized i didn t have a camera and a video camera or anything to take videos
6833,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling shaky i went out into the street
6834,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid just looked at google and read about the great things you can do online

6843,<|emo_fear|> This is so scary. May this person's child be afraid and distressed because of this.
6844,<|emo_fear|> i feel anxious about it because of the number of people in my industry that make over $100k a year and my husband and i live in a world of expense
6846,<|emo_fear|> My worst fear is catching a cold from just looking at you
6847,<|emo_fear|> i just feel kinda frightened
6848,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite uncertain about my future
6849,<|emo_fear|> i feel apprehensive about feeling like i will die
6850,<|emo_fear|> She's just another example of a country that is allowing itself to be seduced by the idea of democracy...and that's scary!
6851,<|emo_fear|> i feel frightened and helpless but also fearful that we dont know what may happen
6852,<|emo_fear|> i feel so paranoid i dont know what i will be doing
6854,<|emo_fear|> im feeling more anxious
6855,<|emo_fear|> Whoa i completely agree. The most terrible things that you can imagine are still happening. It's just a matter of time before it completely engulfs all of us. 
6856,<|emo_fear|> i feel like i could cry it and the tears would hurt my eyes and ears and my skin would feel so hot
6857,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant to share my feelings as they are of much greater concern

6863,<|emo_fear|> It's one of my favourite moments
6864,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling frightened
6865,<|emo_fear|> It's a horrible feeling to be feared by your peers
6866,<|emo_fear|> i feel completely helpless and helpless to do anything at all
6867,<|emo_fear|> i didnt feel agitated
6868,<|emo_fear|> i feel more terrified of another storm
6869,<|emo_fear|> this is a bad post
6870,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im a strange one
6871,"<|emo_fear|> No, it's the ""I know it's silly because I'm usually pretty stupid but... but I would?"" People like this tend to assume any intelligent reply is somehow bad. "
6873,<|emo_fear|> Well that's horrible. I'm so sorry you had to go through that.

6882,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless and scared
6883,<|emo_fear|> i could feel the coldness of it

6901,<|emo_fear|> i think i was feeling nervous and nervous to be back for it
6902,<|emo_fear|> The worst is having too many people who know the exact same songs and enjoy them at the same time
6903,<|emo_fear|> i feel tortured by this experience
6904,<|emo_fear|> i have a feeling that the reason people leave is because they feel more hesitant to go out alone then before
6905,<|emo_fear|> There are other people who have stated that this song is extremely important to them and their lives. It just makes it sad to be so enamoured of your attention to detail.
6906,"<|emo_fear|> And yes, I would of brought a gun to a meet and kill with MY Gun otherwise I would be shot to death!"
6907,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling a bit anxious and wasn t sure if i should give it a try to see if i could

6918,<|emo_fear|> What a wake up call and I’m so sorry to hear that. Is that your story?
6919,<|emo_fear|> What a game.
6921,<|emo_fear|> The weird pressure on the door handle

6938,<|emo_fear|> i still felt shocked and also slightly worried
6939,<|emo_fear|> i feel this is a delicate balance

6953,<|emo_fear|> i just feeling so vulnerable
6954,<|emo_fear|> i feel apprehensive about my own house
6955,<|emo_fear|> i feel tortured by it all but i know it has to work
6956,<|emo_fear|> It looks like a high school project in disguise. Sounds spasticated.
6957,<|emo_fear|> i feel suspicious and uncomfortable around people with these eating disorders
6958,<|emo_fear|> Not to worry - they've all got the same stuff!
6959,<|emo_fear|> Who the hell has reddit in the top 5 most hated companies of all time?
6960,<|emo_fear|> i feel like a weirdo
6961,<|emo_fear|> im feeling so nervous because i didnt think ill ever do it but i really wanna

6979,<|emo_fear|> i feel so helpless to do something
6981,<|emo_fear|> i feel so uncertain about every single thing
6982,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure and uncertain as a new teacher
6983,<|emo_fear|> A guy named [NAME] was recently asked how he was feeling on his birthday and he replied with a big big laugh.
6984,<|emo_fear|> i feel less scared and more inspired
6985,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling a little unsure about this course and that is one of the things that keeps my blood boiling

6993,<|emo_fear|> i am starting to feel overwhelmed
6994,<|emo_fear|> He was the first choice. But I don't want him back.
6995,<|emo_fear|> I’m afraid I’m going to wake up a depressed cretin.
6996,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling quite doubtful as to his truth i must admit that i thought he was the more truthful
6997,<|emo_fear|> This makes me feel old.
6998,<|emo_fear|> i was in the area about the week and i was not reassured by the extent of damage
6999,<|emo_fear|> i do not know how im going to tell i started feeling frightened of things
7000,<|emo_fear|> i have been feeling uncertain and out of place
7001,<|emo_fear|> Because the state needs to be afraid of losing a case. Not this many men.
7002,<|emo_fear|> I’m literally screaming. Now I really need to get into a therapy session lol
7003,<|emo_fear|> i dont want this to feel too strange
7004,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless but not in this case
7006,"<|emo_fear|> i know what i was doing, i was scared, scared myself, just to see you there"
7007,<|emo_fear|> I’m scared for y’all saying it was a terrible thing to do.
7008,<|emo_fear|> This is how you get a situation where no one wants to be the cop because they are afraid the other cop is going to run them down
7010,<|emo_fear|> i do not want people to feel pressured into making an acceptable sacrifice for trusty and expensive comfort
7011,<|emo_fear|> i feel more indecisive and unsure than ever before
7012,<|emo_fear|> It happened so much and I’m so very sorry
7013,<|emo_fear|> Your sister has just posted the same thing to my FB and I'm about to have a heart attack reading all the angry comments she's getting.
7014,<|emo_fear|> A few months ago I was screaming in my room. I didn't do anything. I was devastated I don't know why.
7015,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little paranoid that people who think i just do
7016,<|emo_fear|> But it was a horrible January. [NAME] has been looking strong the last couple weeks though. Good job buddy!
7017,<|emo_fear|> You should try to see her. The doc is incredibly skeptical of these claims.
7019,<|emo_fear|> i feel skeptical and even scared
7020,<|emo_fear|> i can remember feeling terrified as my house burned down and then it seemed like an almost pleasant dream but then a new sense of reality came over me
7021,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling a little apprehensive
7022,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant to ask them in front of everyone but i just want to protect the feelings i have for them
7023,<|emo_fear|> i feel very helpless as i have no one or nothing to ask who dares to do anything but listen to me and then be silent
7024,<|emo_fear|> i know i have been feeling anxious and off
7026,<|emo_fear|> im trying to figure out what to do next but i feel a bit terrified of telling anybody
7027,<|emo_fear|> i feel very hesitant about being on camera
7028,<|emo_fear|> So you're a [RELIGION] [RELIGION] [RELIGION]! What a nightmare!
7031,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling afraid just looking back at the list
7032,<|emo_fear|> i was like i didnt need to feel scared like i was going to lose my hearing in my right ear amp amp my right hand amp the memory will save me now
7033,<|emo_fear|> So now i am wondering if you have a storyboard? What is the process?
7034,<|emo_fear|> This seems a rather dangerous area with videos like this.
7035,<|emo_fear|> You're a terrible person for putting in so much effort to come here and attack the thread.
7036,<|emo_fear|> i feel a lot scared to talk about myself because i don t want people to see what i can do
7037,<|emo_fear|> i remember feeling nervous and feeling like i didnt know what to do and wondering if i should go out
7038,<|emo_fear|> i feel very reluctant to ask to see a medical doctor again
7039,<|emo_fear|> i do feel slightly insecure when i see my family and friends when im alone in the room with him
7040,<|emo_fear|> im feeling more timid and timid i am not gonna lie
7041,<|emo_fear|> i left feeling a bit hesitant
7042,<|emo_fear|> i actually feel unsure sometimes
7043,<|emo_fear|> i do have some feelings of being suspicious
7045,"<|emo_fear|> They’re not just afraid of the future, they want to control it"
7046,<|emo_fear|> im feeling uncertain and a little bit paranoid about it all
7047,<|emo_fear|> I'm just a little scared.
7048,"<|emo_fear|> You should go on a school trip, it's so much better."
7049,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling extremely unsure this week as things around me havent really shaken my confidence
7050,<|emo_fear|> That'd be a terrible year Manchild [NAME] was terrible
7051,<|emo_fear|> i am very much aware of the anxiety and the depression but feel entirely too timid and afraid to talk to a doctor
7052,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling reluctant to admit i am in love
7053,<|emo_fear|> i will tell you one day how i feel afraid to open up my heart to people about who i really am
7054,<|emo_fear|> This is actually horrifying. I don't know how you live with yourself these days.
7055,"<|emo_fear|> Yeah, I'm worried."
7056,<|emo_fear|> i could hear the siren siren siren siren i could hear the siren siren siren oh there was the siren siren siren and i could feel the fear of hell
7057,<|emo_fear|> Ooh. My heart!
7058,<|emo_fear|> im feeling paranoid im just not able to talk and now ill be taking her to one of these places that say i go into deep sleep or get help which of course is not all
7059,<|emo_fear|> i feel about these people is frighteningly similar to the fear i had when i first came up here
7060,<|emo_fear|> when i was younger but i didnt feel shocked and was shocked i didn t feel like i was a weirdo
7061,<|emo_fear|> i always feel so scared
7063,<|emo_fear|> Yeah. My bad but I can’t imagine it was that bad for anyone.
7064,<|emo_fear|> i remember hearing news about a girl on the phone who was feeling so nervous and lost that i was worried about her too
7065,<|emo_fear|> i feel so shy
7066,<|emo_fear|> i want to feel helpless and out of control
7067,<|emo_fear|> i feel apprehensive but willing to try
7068,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure
7070,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling shy about it because I usually talk to all the women in my life because i think they are the only ones who would listen to me but i d go around them the women werent so shy
7071,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling anxious and scared and i thought about how much time passed since christmas
7072,<|emo_fear|> i am still feeling a little skeptical especially after they said it felt more like a picture of an alarmed pet than even a baby
7074,<|emo_fear|> i just feel like this person is uncertain even though they are being truthful
7075,<|emo_fear|> I'm so scared to tell my parents
7076,<|emo_fear|> i just feel a bit frightened
7077,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little unsure
7078,<|emo_fear|> i feel really skeptical about all of these claims as well
7079,<|emo_fear|> It feels like one of those movies where the baddie has a horrible idea... but the people around him freak out and try to stop him before it's too late
7080,<|emo_fear|> That's a horrible tip. I would tell her to check the area around the restaurant first. Very scary.
7081,<|emo_fear|> That's because you're a very public enemy number one.
7082,<|emo_fear|> The fact this is written on notebook paper is incredibly creepy.
7083,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] whyyyyy....
7084,<|emo_fear|> There’s a good chance he would have committed those crimes if he’d had a choice. Not knowing makes it all the more tragic.
7085,<|emo_fear|> i feel vulnerable
7086,<|emo_fear|> i feel more insecure than before even when i m alone
7087,<|emo_fear|> i feel intimidated by their numbers and their needs
7088,<|emo_fear|> im feeling suspicious
7089,<|emo_fear|> I’m afraid I’m gonna die today
7090,<|emo_fear|> im still feeling scared and confused and sad that my nightmares are coming true
7091,<|emo_fear|> im feeling extremely shy and insecure with girls
7092,"<|emo_fear|> I’m with you, it really does. I’m very lucky and very scared."
7093,<|emo_fear|> i do feel hesitant to talk to a href http bit.ly/2ztT0eO
7094,<|emo_fear|> i feel shy and unsure and scared
7095,<|emo_fear|> i have this kind of feelings often when i am extremely frightened
7096,<|emo_fear|> So... you got banned? Good for you!
7097,<|emo_fear|> i didn’t feel as terrified as i did
7098,<|emo_fear|> I'm scared that I might lose potential study time by meeting up with him
7099,<|emo_fear|> You really think that would have kept [NAME] from getting a year? He had already received a year.
7100,<|emo_fear|> This is kinda scary.
7102,<|emo_fear|> i feel weird writing to someone who is too close to me about my progress on the car for it to be real and serious
7103,<|emo_fear|> i came home and i felt so insecure
7104,<|emo_fear|> of course
7105,<|emo_fear|> i don t know about you but if it is the holidays then i am feeling a little apprehensive
7107,<|emo_fear|> i can feel her nervousness and apprehensiveness but she assured me this will go well
7108,<|emo_fear|> that made me feel so weird reading some of the comments on my old news article about him
7109,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] looks dangerous out there.
7110,<|emo_fear|> i remember feeling extremely terrified when i heard about the accident
7111,<|emo_fear|> i feel tortured by my own guilt
7112,<|emo_fear|> i feel really scared of all of the unknown
7113,<|emo_fear|> Oh I know oh I know it's terrible
7114,<|emo_fear|> Yeah that [NAME] video is shaky and the guy wasn't remorseful. Just pissed off by something on his part
7116,<|emo_fear|> It’s scary and I feel like it’s normal.
7117,<|emo_fear|> i didnt know then that i must feel very hesitant to come back here anymore im afraid to look back on it now
7118,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very apprehensive because he has yet to speak
7119,<|emo_fear|> I am afraid I have forgotten how scary children can be. How much I loved Scary House. It terrified me.
7120,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit weird doing this but im not going to give up on this game just yet
7121,<|emo_fear|> i feel uncertain anxious and excited
7122,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little scared of what is to come
7123,<|emo_fear|> i feel so doubtful of my ability to write when no one has ever said anything to me but what i do know is that i need to at least tell a story to someones ears
7124,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit intimidated
7125,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling less vulnerable and more in control
7126,"<|emo_fear|> What's the cringe? I'm a man, I don't cringe."
7127,<|emo_fear|> i didn t feel scared i felt hopeful
7128,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im going to cry and have horrible nightmares over it all
7129,<|emo_fear|> i feel very shy and timid now
7130,<|emo_fear|> i can tell you that i m feeling insecure about most of the stuff that i do
7131,<|emo_fear|> i feel skeptical and doubtful of everything
7132,<|emo_fear|> i dont know you or the issues that you are struggling with but i feel helpless to help you
7133,<|emo_fear|> i feel so frightened for myself because of him
7134,<|emo_fear|> i feel shy about being around people because im afraid that theyll think im creepy
7135,<|emo_fear|> i get nervous
7136,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling very apprehensive
7137,<|emo_fear|> i don t know how i feel or should feel the horror and horror is an accepted bygown
7138,"<|emo_fear|> The scary thing is, she looked exactly like [NAME]!"
7139,<|emo_fear|> This again? I’m afraid we are never going back to Scottish First Minister [NAME] but I really enjoyed the Man in theMask episode.
7140,<|emo_fear|> the first time i met her i felt creepy
7142,<|emo_fear|> i know is that i am feeling agitated right now
7143,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little reluctant to write back to you but i feel like im really close to you
7145,<|emo_fear|> i have a feeling im about to feel a little paranoid
7146,<|emo_fear|> That's unfortunate.
7147,"<|emo_fear|> This is kinda creepy. Maybe make it a little more horror inspired? Personally, it's not that bad."
7148,<|emo_fear|> I would fear for his life. I wonder how it would feel to have a loved one who could have done this
7149,<|emo_fear|> i didn t have a particularly strong feeling that he was being wronged he would always remain calm and would always respond to questions with the confidence of a respected owner
7150,<|emo_fear|> i find myself feeling more hesitant before i take a picture of this bird
7151,<|emo_fear|> I thought it said “Sickly Apple” I was wrong. Thanks for the info all the way around!
7152,<|emo_fear|> The worst is when they have no idea what you said!
7153,<|emo_fear|> We get scared easily
7154,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite nervous about it
7155,<|emo_fear|> We're all afraid to have our guard up
7156,<|emo_fear|> i still feel a little unsure as hell but
7157,<|emo_fear|> You're scary
7158,<|emo_fear|> This is a terrible time to plan a trip because it’s usually the worst when you get to a new place and it’s the worst because it’s the worst
7159,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit worried for the poor cat
7160,<|emo_fear|> i had no idea that when i was talking about feelings you were being manipulative
7161,<|emo_fear|> i feel agitated and nervous
7162,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling pretty shaky lately and just didn t like the feeling at all
7163,<|emo_fear|> i am not saying there are no women who are comfortable in the home i am just saying i have questions about how the question about being seen as submissive affects my ability to feel more powerful in the home
7164,<|emo_fear|> This post made me feel I had depression for a second. Go take a breath you shill.
7165,"<|emo_fear|> I'm scared that, should I go, I'll start bleeding out and destroy everything I have"
7166,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless and im scared
7167,<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid he knows.
7168,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling pretty nervous
7169,<|emo_fear|> i felt nervous just talking about this
7170,<|emo_fear|> im feeling anxious for something much bigger than this
7172,<|emo_fear|> i actually feel skeptical of any of these things
7173,<|emo_fear|> Just terrible. The only positive thing I can think of is seeing a therapist or a pharmacist.
7174,<|emo_fear|> i think about how little i know on top of my fear why should i feel terrified about it i know the feeling it must be there somewhere deep down my soul knows but it s nothing i feel terrified of or afraid of
7175,<|emo_fear|> Damn son.
7176,<|emo_fear|> i have this weird feeling of being almost too paranoid
7177,<|emo_fear|> i feel very vulnerable about my body and a few months ago this idea of an embrace helped me to break free of it
7178,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little bit apprehensive
7179,"<|emo_fear|> It was all in there... I heard it was bad, and I was scared"
7180,<|emo_fear|> We have a dangerous race.
7181,<|emo_fear|> i hope that when i finish this episode that i don t feel too shamed
7182,<|emo_fear|> i feel weird about this
7183,<|emo_fear|> i feel that what i am trying to write in this blog is a bit vain
7184,<|emo_fear|> That [NAME] guy is scary
7185,<|emo_fear|> I'm more worried about [NAME] finding a way to get his passes to guys that are not afraid to give them ups.
7186,<|emo_fear|> I'm so scared to tell my mom
7187,<|emo_fear|> Omg that’s just horrible
7188,"<|emo_fear|> [NAME] was horrible yesterday, I’m so bad. "
7189,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit apprehensive about this as before i got married i had a great thing going with a very good man that i felt really passionate about and he had done so well for himself
7191,<|emo_fear|> i feeling shaky and extremely uncomfortable
7193,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite nervous because we have never had someone with a heart attack as an excuse come along
7194,<|emo_fear|> i started feeling reluctant and anxious feeling like things werent cool and yet i also saw the light
7196,<|emo_fear|> i actually feel a little hesitant about having him because i feel like he might become an awful person without me around
7197,"<|emo_fear|> ""Dude that is a really awkward shot"" -astounding comments from the source"
7198,<|emo_fear|> It would be more realistic if they knew what was in these pills
7199,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless to do anything about it
7200,<|emo_fear|> This is the saddest thing I think I’ve read in months. My heart aches for you
7201,<|emo_fear|> i feel terrified terrified
7203,<|emo_fear|> im sure she has a good reason to feel afraid
7204,<|emo_fear|> i can find it in my heart to forgive something for which i feel no anger or guilt
7205,<|emo_fear|> i said i can t tell if it s feeling confused or if im just really not looking.
7206,<|emo_fear|> i feel kind of shocked and hurt at how little we get feedback from him on things
7207,<|emo_fear|> i have been feeling nervous to tell everyone about what happened
7208,<|emo_fear|> i also feel less terrified and more confident
7209,<|emo_fear|> I think I see where you are coming from...
7210,<|emo_fear|> i feel pretty insecure and nervous if i dont say something sooner
7211,<|emo_fear|> So many people know and love [NAME] but their reaction to this photo is so telling.
7212,<|emo_fear|> i would feel reluctant to move forward with my plan again if theres always a greater fear that youre going to be wrong
7213,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] was absolutely awful last night
7214,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling a little bit overwhelmed these past couple weeks with my needs for the week before coming
7217,<|emo_fear|> i feel vulnerable and lonely
7218,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid of talking about my anxiety
7219,<|emo_fear|> i still feel a little hesitant about putting a blanket on me but in the end i will
7220,<|emo_fear|> i want tat i want to feel helpless
7221,<|emo_fear|> i dont know why the pain makes me feel fearful in this strange world
7222,<|emo_fear|> i feel skeptical of every single thing he says
7223,<|emo_fear|> This is my favorite wild memory
7224,<|emo_fear|> i started feeling a bit anxious
7225,<|emo_fear|> i felt a little terrified to put it into words but actually i wasnt feeling scared at all
7226,<|emo_fear|> i know i must be feeling skeptical but i have been lucky enough to get through worse than this
7227,<|emo_fear|> Holy shit I didn't know [NAME] was abox
7228,<|emo_fear|> i can do whatever i can without feeling terrified or depressed
7229,<|emo_fear|> im feeling reluctant and fearful of everything
7230,<|emo_fear|> im feeling more hesitant about it as the summer progresses and start to realise im not sure if im over it or not
7232,<|emo_fear|> i had the unfortunate luck of coming across with such an amazing friend the other day but also feeling like the most hated person in the world
7233,<|emo_fear|> i have been on a lot of trips and still am not used to the feeling as it is not something i feel in the same way as the strange sense of security and safety of a home
7234,<|emo_fear|> i remember feeling so terrified that i would fail
7235,<|emo_fear|> i feel extremely helpless and even more terrified of what may happen to my health should i have an accident or worse
7236,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little bit more reluctant about saying anything now
7237,<|emo_fear|> i can actually feel that hes afraid of what she feels because he isnt telling her everything at all
7238,<|emo_fear|> i woke up feeling terrified
7239,<|emo_fear|> She's definitely creepy
7240,<|emo_fear|> i feel very helpless
7241,<|emo_fear|> I’m scared for y’all saying we’re doing a [RELIGION] bashing 
7243,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling doubtful about all these things and worried that i m being punished for doing them
7244,<|emo_fear|> He was afraid they were going to find out he had no internet connection!!
7245,<|emo_fear|> i must say that when i was feeling insecure or uncomfortable
7246,<|emo_fear|> i do not feel insecure
7247,"<|emo_fear|> If you have an idea, I'd love to hear it!"
7248,<|emo_fear|> i get that feeling sometimes but im not sure why
7250,<|emo_fear|> i didn t feel paranoid and scared
7251,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling so insecure
7252,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling a bit anxious
7253,<|emo_fear|> i feeling kind of suspicious that all this time i was not getting anything worthwhile out of her
7254,<|emo_fear|> i have these weird feelings that i dont know what to do right now but at least i have hope
7255,<|emo_fear|> im still feeling a little scared
7256,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little frightened that the world im living in isnt as frightening as i had thought and that the people in my life arent as fearful
7257,<|emo_fear|> A couple of months ago she told me her dream of becoming an DJ was over
7258,<|emo_fear|> i feel somewhat skeptical and unsure about this
7259,"<|emo_fear|> Yeah I would know not only was she a child, but there was also an awful lot of loud screaming at the top of her voice just before she fell. "
7260,<|emo_fear|> So pathetic and desperate
7261,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling a bit apprehensive and worried
7262,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling very shy
7263,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared because i dont know how i can help
7264,<|emo_fear|> The scary thing is that he seems to have a good social life...
7265,<|emo_fear|> i feel this is almost frightening to be honest
7266,<|emo_fear|> i feel uncertain about things because no one really told me why
7267,<|emo_fear|> ive spent a lot of time feeling very uncertain about my safety
7268,<|emo_fear|> That is definitely a terrible open shot.... probably the worst I've ever seen him
7269,<|emo_fear|> i have found it more and more difficult to keep my feelings under control to the point where i find the need to make them into something more frightening
7270,<|emo_fear|> i feel more frightened and upset than i did when i first came here
7271,<|emo_fear|> This is so scary. Imagine if [NAME] had a son now.
7273,<|emo_fear|> im nervous about feeling vulnerable
7274,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared to try different foods but it s what im supposed to do
7275,<|emo_fear|> i started feeling scared and then very suddenly confidence came into my head
7276,<|emo_fear|> i dont hate them because i dont feel pressured to have sex or at least be faithful
7277,<|emo_fear|> i feeling extremely helpless and helpless to change things but still have no one to talk to
7278,<|emo_fear|> when one of my friends got into a fight with her bully
7279,<|emo_fear|> It's a weird thing to believe. People who are very into/engaged in spiritual things tend to be very fearful of spiritual issues.
7280,<|emo_fear|> i feel overwhelmed overwhelmed and have a short window of time to feel safe or find some kind of work
7281,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure of my place in the world
7282,<|emo_fear|> That’s a terrifying number
7283,<|emo_fear|> i feel very little fear
7284,<|emo_fear|> That's awful. She could have easily died there.
7285,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling nervous on the outside but once im on the other side i feel like a smarty coming in
7287,<|emo_fear|> im feeling overwhelmed with work im not sure why
7288,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant to give them the ultimatum but that could work out fine
7289,<|emo_fear|> im feeling doubtful and worried and very excited for some reason
7290,<|emo_fear|> i think about what happened on the day i went to sleep i start feeling nervous
7293,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid to let you into my house
7294,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling very confused inside
7295,<|emo_fear|> I'm an actual risk taker. I'm not scared to buy it myself.
7296,<|emo_fear|> I know but it feels too damn creepy.
7297,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little shy and apprehensive about this kind of thing
7299,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid i am afraid i am afraid
7300,<|emo_fear|> i was shocked when they told i had met the wife of a well known business head at the event and we had been friends for years and i did not feel that he had any trust in me
7301,<|emo_fear|> I've seen this TED talk. It makes perfect sense now.
7302,<|emo_fear|> i feel weird writing about this
7303,<|emo_fear|> And people still go without vaccinated because there's always a scary potential side effect of something being tummyophobic which is why they're still forced to cover.
7305,<|emo_fear|> i would feel reluctant not to take a walk and make the leap into the strange
7306,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very apprehensive and anxious right now
7307,"<|emo_fear|> They all get up around 6am. Sadly, I am not sure what they do at that hour."
7308,<|emo_fear|> This is scary and so very sad. Eleven??? A baby! I was still building forts. I weep for this child.
7309,<|emo_fear|> Oh [NAME]. I never even knew you had depression. Hope you feel better to people than that.
7310,"<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid to even ask, but do any of you have video of him? I'd love some sort of documentary of his trip"
7311,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling quite apprehensive about the future of the art world
7312,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] i don’t even care about [NAME] I’m more interested in [NAME]
7313,<|emo_fear|> Holy shit!!
7314,<|emo_fear|> im feeling paranoid about that
7315,<|emo_fear|> This is very scary.
7316,<|emo_fear|> What a complete and utter cunt.
7318,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling anxious about it and didnt know what to do
7319,<|emo_fear|> i dont know why i feel afraid
7320,<|emo_fear|> i am not that easy to please and when i feel stressed something happens that i cannot control
7321,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling skeptical at first before feeling overwhelmed by its beauty
7322,<|emo_fear|> i feel so hesitant to tell
7323,<|emo_fear|> im feeling reluctant to blog
7325,<|emo_fear|> i still feel shy and indecisive
7326,<|emo_fear|> I've also heard of people who have actually ended up doing exactly that...
7327,<|emo_fear|> i do feel quite vulnerable
7328,<|emo_fear|> Oh no the poor man
7329,<|emo_fear|> This is so scary to know that you went through that phase. I hope this is true
7331,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant to give it an actual rating
7332,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] and [NAME] are scary
7333,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling very fearful and then there was a terrifying realization
7335,<|emo_fear|> When i looked at it it was like seeing a horror movie with super computer graphics
7336,<|emo_fear|> It happened so close to my house that the next time I walked in I'd be on my knees shaking and crying
7337,<|emo_fear|> i feeling tortured by the memory of that night
7339,<|emo_fear|> That’s a terrible amount of bp for one sub... I’m extremely concerned for this scene.
7340,<|emo_fear|> He would become your Worst fear
7341,<|emo_fear|> i always feel reluctant to take on these projects
7342,"<|emo_fear|> Not sure what that is about, but I'm pretty scared to look at it. "
7343,<|emo_fear|> I’m scared to find out what kind of thing you could get for breakfast there :(
7344,<|emo_fear|> No comment. Stay safe and sound.
7345,<|emo_fear|> i feel so uncertain a href http nikyoung
7346,<|emo_fear|> im feeling vulnerable right now
7347,<|emo_fear|> Ahhhh I had no idea you said that! Thanks for sharing
7348,<|emo_fear|> i would feel intimidated to be around people who are that older
7349,<|emo_fear|> Who knew there were so many amazing nicknames for [NAME]!
7350,<|emo_fear|> It’s a weird question. Generally speaking I don’t worry much about underage stuff. I’m worried more about people trusting you.

7353,<|emo_fear|> i want her to understand how i feel terrified for her child
7354,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling very anxious lately not only over things that arent really my control but also general life
7355,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little reluctant
7356,<|emo_fear|> i feel fearful if i were to know what i know now it would leave me face to face with the demons that have surrounded me for so long
7358,<|emo_fear|> i have been so overwhelmed with grief that i feel a little overwhelmed thinking about it
7359,<|emo_fear|> i would like to describe my feelings of scared nervous excited and extremely apprehensive because it is possible that I may get injured

7361,<|emo_fear|> i feel very uncertain in my abilities
7362,<|emo_fear|> > they hated [NAME] They hated him because he told them the truth
7363,<|emo_fear|> i just feel insecure about who i am right now

7366,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel terrified
7367,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling very shaken and very scared inside

7383,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless when i am sick
7384,<|emo_fear|> I'm a terrible person but I'm more worried about your mental health than all of that.
7385,"<|emo_fear|> This seems so desperate, but I’m afraid to tell my parents. I’m so sorry. "
7386,<|emo_fear|> i feel like i m in some weird version of the book of jesus where the evil prince called angelus is just a god of death and destruction
7387,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little nervous but i think i could do this
7388,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling paranoid that i didnt care enough
7390,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling reluctant to press charges because i didnt want to hurt her feelings
7391,"<|emo_fear|> But the newsroom is so obsessed with the ""berluscon conspiracy"" they completely miss the real story - that top Dems are terrified of [NAME] becoming president."
7392,<|emo_fear|> [NAME]! You're the one who's scared out there!

7456,<|emo_fear|> Just the name of it gives me anxiety
7457,"<|emo_fear|> The whole purpose of the [NAME] study was to find the link between childhood poverty and adult poverty, which is weird to believe since childhood poverty was much more common back then."
7458,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to tell him about the changes in our sleeping phase
7459,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless and ashamed of myself as i know im on a fault line between childhood and adult time
7460,<|emo_fear|> i always feel like i dont know what to do to reply to this so i usually go with this

7463,<|emo_fear|> My biggest nightmare is catching an infection from a tick

7466,<|emo_fear|> i didnt feel shy or anxious so i didnt need to be told that i look a little weird
7468,<|emo_fear|> i was in a situation where i actually feel scared because im not an official witness at this point im just a bystander
7469,"<|emo_fear|> As a [NAME], I fear for [NAME] family..."
7470,<|emo_fear|> I have one. My anxiety is so bad I have it every time I open a can from the kitchen.
7471,"<|emo_fear|> As much as I'd love it, I don't understand why they have to get caught. "
7472,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling a little apprehensive about it as i have a history of anxiety
7473,<|emo_fear|> i feel like the last thing you want to be doing when youre in pain is leaving your vomit on the floor just for the other person to see
7474,<|emo_fear|> What a sickening read. Sickening because it's true lol.
7475,<|emo_fear|> oh [NAME] just got called out Oh [NAME] no

7484,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] fucking dammit
7485,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling very anxious thinking about it
7486,<|emo_fear|> Omg stop spamming.
7487,<|emo_fear|> i feel as if i could somehow scare a dog or trap a cat without having to make a lot of noise or scare it enough to scare the cat enough to actually scare it into something it wont do
7488,"<|emo_fear|> It's like when I told my wife I loved her but when I looked at my reflection in the mirror I recognized her, just not in that romantic way."
7489,<|emo_fear|> i felt a strong sense of anxiety that i was letting him know
7490,<|emo_fear|> I miss [NAME]
7491,<|emo_fear|> This is scary. I love Canada🇨🇦 but this is scary.

7495,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite helpless
7496,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit shy to go talk to them outside of work but am eager to be able to talk to them at rest if it s possible
7497,<|emo_fear|> i did not feel confused
7498,<|emo_fear|> A guy from Reddit said this was probably one of his masturbatory fantasies
7499,<|emo_fear|> This is the exact horror I fear the most
7500,<|emo_fear|> i was just wondering what kind of reaction i should expect because when i got home i really wasnt feeling nervous by the looks i saw in the door
7501,<|emo_fear|> im sitting here looking at the weather it would be strange if i didnt feel a little bit hot
7502,<|emo_fear|> i just remember feeling so helpless about my situation
7503,<|emo_fear|> i think it is a good idea to see if the person can do it and that feels a little scary
7504,<|emo_fear|> i didnt feel that scared in that moment
7505,<|emo_fear|> i was walking near the dam and looking out into the water i looked at the water and I felt scared
7506,<|emo_fear|> i am currently feeling nervous and scared about the future but i definitely know that its here
7507,<|emo_fear|> icala you're scare ugly
7508,<|emo_fear|> i got to work i was feeling fairly nervous
7510,<|emo_fear|> i woke up feeling so agitated
7511,<|emo_fear|> My husband had a nearly-fatal allergic episode two months ago and is fighting a horrible battle with anti-nausea for it. She hasn't eaten in two weeks and has been hospitalised repeatedly.
7512,<|emo_fear|> That is so scary to know that [NAME] is still alive.
7513,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little apprehensive about all this
7514,<|emo_fear|> i didn t feel like you were really trying to be creepy but i m afraid you had a very similar relationship to gusgasm
7515,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless and im sorry
7516,<|emo_fear|> i started feeling afraid that i was going to be wrong
7517,<|emo_fear|> That was worse than a movie jump scare. I can't imagine.
7518,<|emo_fear|> i think about how the past six months have been pretty shaky for him and i feel terrified for how it all will go in the future he will have to do it alone to his own fate for sure
7519,<|emo_fear|> i feel anxious or even depressed
7521,<|emo_fear|> I’m afraid it is just me. Sorry for the terrible reply. 🤣
7522,<|emo_fear|> i went to the store when i was feeling a little bit apprehensive all these people in the waiting room were telling me what a great night i had and that my hair was perfect
7523,<|emo_fear|> So you’re a disgusting piece.
7524,<|emo_fear|> i feel like i should be scared about it but then it comes out that im pretty safe
7526,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless just trying to give her advice
7527,<|emo_fear|> i feel doubtful i wonder what people think about me
7528,<|emo_fear|> i can no longer sit down and feel intimidated by the things and people i am now afraid to even talk to
7530,<|emo_fear|> i do not feel frightened any more
7531,<|emo_fear|> i think i went for it because i felt scared of what people would think but im not sure why
7532,"<|emo_fear|> I don't have kids yet so it's totally possible I'll never get one, also I'm incel. "
7533,"<|emo_fear|> Well I think it’s just me, I could be wrong though."
7535,<|emo_fear|> i feel frightened and lonely
7536,<|emo_fear|> i feel more vulnerable and worried and fearful right now than i was when i got back from the hospital
7538,<|emo_fear|> im sure if you read this you will feel convinced that there is something seriously wrong but unfortunately for you you and im suppose to explain this feeling then im afraid you wont know how hard you have to work to find this correct understanding
7539,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant to post this as i m afraid it will cause pain if i do
7540,<|emo_fear|> What a weird way to say the same thing.
7541,<|emo_fear|> i do not feel shaken or insecure or anything at all
7542,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little hesitant posting them here
7543,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared to be around a lot of people from work
7544,<|emo_fear|> Your sister sounds distraught.
7545,<|emo_fear|> i have to say i still feel a bit skeptical but i know for a fact that we are in for a good time with this game and with me
7546,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant and indecisive about making that connection
7547,"<|emo_fear|> ""I love him, but he should not run for president"" is pretty much the statement."
7548,<|emo_fear|> i think because of how much i feel scared and wondering how far i want to take this
7549,<|emo_fear|> It would still leave you vulnerable no matter how much time passed since it happened
7550,<|emo_fear|> It’s weird how much I liked this show before it got cancelled.
7551,<|emo_fear|> im feeling fearful right now
7552,<|emo_fear|> i know something and no i dont trust or want to trust people like that not matter how much trust i feel for them no
7553,<|emo_fear|> im feeling reluctant for everything i do right now
7554,<|emo_fear|> i feel very apprehensive about her future
7555,<|emo_fear|> i also feel uncertain and uncertain enough that when i feel like having panic attacks or something i know im going to wake up as a zombie the next day
7557,<|emo_fear|> i feel weird about not saying anything because i feel like youre the only one that has done it
7558,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little unsure about what to tell other children of people and family who are feeling the way i did
7559,<|emo_fear|> i feel like the least dangerous person you ve ever likely met
7560,<|emo_fear|> i woke up feeling very strange and dizzy
7562,<|emo_fear|> Oh wait that's today
7564,<|emo_fear|> i just feel really very helpless and i feel like i could do anything if i used my god power
7566,<|emo_fear|> I know a couple of people who have. It's awful and they're completely right. I don't always go to their videos though. That's a big red flag.
7567,<|emo_fear|> That sounds an awful lot like khorne......
7568,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling reluctant to try something which did not suit me
7569,<|emo_fear|> i just dont feel up to it and im pretty scared for the future
7570,<|emo_fear|> i know you can tell me i am feeling anxious because all of sudden im saying all these big things but no i really dont
7571,<|emo_fear|> i know that i love you and i feel as if im afraid that i am doing something wrong to you
7572,<|emo_fear|> i see these things and i feel so weird or scared im going to try and pretend thats it
7573,"<|emo_fear|> I feel [NAME] is really afraid to be left alone, she's probably thinking about her singing teacher."
7574,<|emo_fear|> i do not want to go to an eating disorder support services because i know how terrible it feels to have gone to one
7575,<|emo_fear|> i have this odd feeling that im looking in vain for a good place
7576,<|emo_fear|> of course not
7577,<|emo_fear|> i feel really reluctant
7578,"<|emo_fear|> But also, her eyebrows. What a nightmare."
7579,<|emo_fear|> Lol [NAME] can get intimidated by [NAME] and his big personality but thats not one of his biggest faults.
7580,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling paranoid because im sleeping with the window open
7581,<|emo_fear|> But its a terrible meme because it implies that all men are stupid and/or dangerous
7582,<|emo_fear|> i also feel a little weird saying this but we were having so much fun and getting things done together
7584,<|emo_fear|> The comment was so terrible. I am truly sorry.
7585,"<|emo_fear|> As an artist, an adult, and someone with depression I find this video very triggering..."
7586,<|emo_fear|> i feel frightened because i am afraid that im going to be attacked
7587,<|emo_fear|> im feeling quite hesitant to put this to writing
7588,<|emo_fear|> im sorry to hear that after two weeks you havent accepted this
7589,<|emo_fear|> i feel shy because it sounds like it could be used to bully me all the time
7590,<|emo_fear|> i get this feeling that i was tortured so horribly by this guy and his obsession with some sort of weird cult
7591,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant when it comes to talking about work relationships
7592,<|emo_fear|> i have been feeling a tad apprehensive
7594,<|emo_fear|> Damn there are some good memes going around right now
7595,<|emo_fear|> You are so scary
7596,<|emo_fear|> i could feel myself making strange sounds but nothing at all was coming out of my ear he s hands were shaking and shaking and my heart was so very agitated
7597,<|emo_fear|> i felt so scared to get off as it was only the escalator way down and the lift door was locked
7598,<|emo_fear|> It was scary.
7599,<|emo_fear|> i feel very unsure and insecure as if i have just lost it
7600,"<|emo_fear|> It's weird that [NAME] seems to think cops should be afraid of being ""armed and ready"""
7601,<|emo_fear|> It’s all a paranoid game to try and scare people away from realizing that you’re the one who is trying to take away your guns
7603,"<|emo_fear|> ""I don't have food on me"" then what the actual fuck."
7604,<|emo_fear|> i feel intimidated or afraid of an exam
7605,<|emo_fear|> i have also had sleep paralysis twice and the nightmare is still terrible and makes me feel so helpless and alone
7606,<|emo_fear|> im feeling so fearful of everything and everybody around me
7608,<|emo_fear|> i began to feel that the world was strange and wondered how i could understand it without experience
7609,<|emo_fear|> Omg those are some killer boots
7610,<|emo_fear|> It's kind of scary how easily this happens to us... So many products we trust are based on trusted third party vendors.
7611,<|emo_fear|> i started feeling paranoid when people started talking about this
7612,<|emo_fear|> i began to feel very hesitant to come out
7613,<|emo_fear|> I just feel really disturbed since [NAME] only played for the Eagles and [NAME] only played for the Chargers
7614,<|emo_fear|> i would feel suspicious
7615,<|emo_fear|> i cant help but feel anxious
7617,<|emo_fear|> i always feel helpless as you say this but i am not and i never will be as i can never change and am not in the position to change it
7618,<|emo_fear|> i don t know how this is the right word but i feel like i have heard it over and over again and it s hard for me to come to terms
7619,<|emo_fear|> Omg yes.
7621,<|emo_fear|> i didnt want to feel intimidated to ask questions
7622,"<|emo_fear|> [NAME] is such a terrible defender... also, he has amazing anticipation"
7623,<|emo_fear|> i have just become more frightened of these things by the day
7624,<|emo_fear|> i feel terrified for my baby
7625,<|emo_fear|> I don't know [NAME] but I'm afraid he's a bit of a bully.
7627,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling more anxious than ever as it is
7628,<|emo_fear|> i can do a lot more on the computer and feel quite pressured
7629,<|emo_fear|> i just wanna say i am feeling very fearful right now
7630,<|emo_fear|> That's why I recommend doing a little online research before you go hire someone. You can see how dangerous it is to go there.
7631,<|emo_fear|> i just got inspired after reading this story. something is really wrong with me but im feeling hopeful
7632,<|emo_fear|> Your age difference is incredibly creepy. Couldn't even imagine the horror that would ensue if you were 35
7633,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling fearful about the future as i am burdened with great expectations
7635,"<|emo_fear|> > It was hard to stomach at times thanks to all the food, but it was worth it in the end Thanks love you"
7636,<|emo_fear|> I have a bad feeling [NAME] is going to pull a [NAME] and go right for it.
7637,<|emo_fear|> ive noticed the same thing but in more obvious and unfortunate ways and am feeling a bit dumb
7638,<|emo_fear|> i went to bed again feeling anxious and shaky and all
7639,<|emo_fear|> This sounds Exactly like my nightmares. I feel personally attacked.
7640,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a bit reluctant to blog this but seriously if youre reading this for the first time then youll probably be quite shocked by what youre about to find
7641,<|emo_fear|> oh sssssshhh don’t be scared
7642,<|emo_fear|> I am afraid that is not what you meant
7644,"<|emo_fear|> Yeah, I was reading about this case and wondering what the odds were that the cops would somehow decide to not press charges but instead let him go free after a reasonable amount of time."
7645,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling uncertain or fearful
7646,<|emo_fear|> of course i would say im nervous because im usually anxious about anything that could possibly go wrong during our first 2 weeks together
7647,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared that i will come across something if i don t
7648,<|emo_fear|> That was so creepy and so sad. Eleven??? A baby! I was still building forts forts. I weep for this child.
7649,<|emo_fear|> i feel very uncertain and uncertain of my future
7650,<|emo_fear|> You could be totally right. I'm so scared to my soul for the things I really want to say to my mom :(
7651,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared because i know i will not be able to help
7652,<|emo_fear|> i feel less fearful and more confident in myself
7653,<|emo_fear|> i feel very reluctant to do anything lately
7654,<|emo_fear|> This just seems to be bad writing. Your characters are easily confused and inconsistent and this just seems to go off the rails.
7655,<|emo_fear|> i have also been feeling this way for a while lately and as a result i am afraid im going to lose what i feel is precious time
7656,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling quite nervous
7657,<|emo_fear|> There's a reason why people kill each other over the internet. It's just sad...
7658,<|emo_fear|> i see other kids and at the age i think i start trusting and im afraid that im gonna feel shy after and if that has happened
7659,<|emo_fear|> Thats just sad because otherwise it might be quite interesting.
7660,"<|emo_fear|> > The only thing stronger than a lie is proof that we told a big lie. Well, I'm afraid I can't prove that we told a big lie."
7661,<|emo_fear|> That'll teach him a thing or two.
7662,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared afraid and i dont know what i am doing
7663,<|emo_fear|> Not too shabby at all.
7664,<|emo_fear|> i know i feel vulnerable by everyone around me but now all my friends and family are saying the same thing
7665,<|emo_fear|> i cant help feeling uncomfortable
7666,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little apprehensive about posting about this
7667,<|emo_fear|> i feel paranoid and upset
7668,<|emo_fear|> i think there are people who feel afraid of the things they see
7669,"<|emo_fear|> Just don't call it a ""recovery"" unless all you hear are loud and sudden denials on both sides."
7670,<|emo_fear|> i feel really nervous going into it too
7671,<|emo_fear|> It's disgusting how many fake news sites rely on [NAME] for truth
7673,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little bit paranoid
7674,<|emo_fear|> I thought there was a special place in hell for these people
7675,<|emo_fear|> i feel so agitated
7677,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling a bit of a bit paranoid recently because i dont know where anyone is and im afraid the same could happen to me
7678,<|emo_fear|> i have no feeling im terrified of what may happen if i do or im afraid of what that might do to me if i fail
7679,"<|emo_fear|> Oh, you're right!"
7680,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little paranoid and anxious about leaving the house
7682,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little nervous right now but this new challenge is incredibly exciting because when i was in high school theres always this pressure to do better but at the same time i think the same pressure to be the best in school
7683,<|emo_fear|> I'm literally on fire right now😂
7684,<|emo_fear|> i didnt feel like the person was very understanding in that it sounds like youre a very reluctant romantic
7685,<|emo_fear|> i feel slightly tortured writing about her
7686,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel any fear or anxiety and am actually quite happy to say my anxiety has lessened by such methods
7687,<|emo_fear|> i came to that conclusion after watching this video more time than i expected how it took me to come to that conclusion
7688,<|emo_fear|> i feel less scared and i even feel more powerful sometimes
7689,<|emo_fear|> i also feel a strange sense of responsibility
7690,<|emo_fear|> I was afraid of doing this. But I think my parents will see this if I do it.
7691,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel agitated thinking about this
7692,<|emo_fear|> im feeling reluctant about the whole question
7693,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling pretty paranoid about what people were doing since this is the first time i have ever run into them
7694,<|emo_fear|> i have a lot of energy sometimes when i feel apprehensive about going even though it may still feel like i have more strength than I do that is very dangerous
7696,<|emo_fear|> i have felt a little unsure if im in the right place at the right time and im nervous and worried
7697,<|emo_fear|> I'm so scared to tell her :(
7698,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid to tell anyone
7699,<|emo_fear|> I’m scared for y’all saying it wasn’t [NAME] 😤 
7700,<|emo_fear|> Because it's scary and weird and stuff
7701,<|emo_fear|> ive just been feeling pretty apprehensive about going
7703,"<|emo_fear|> It happens all the time, I have literally felt it on so many occasions. It's terrifying and mental."
7704,"<|emo_fear|> I can't do that, I'm too scared."
7706,<|emo_fear|> i can feel a bit afraid but then again i have been in situations where i have no power against people
7707,<|emo_fear|> i began to feel very confused and confused
7708,<|emo_fear|> i got my first job out of college and i feel apprehensive right now
7709,"<|emo_fear|> Holy fuck, I just refreshed this in US just to see this. What a nightmare."
7710,<|emo_fear|> i could feel myself getting scared
7711,<|emo_fear|> That's the last time I saw that!
7712,<|emo_fear|> when my mother died after a very long illness
7713,<|emo_fear|> That's a lot worse tbh
7714,<|emo_fear|> He's an awful person
7715,<|emo_fear|> i also feel kind of weird on and off the scale because no one knows me on it
7717,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling quite shy and a bit frightened
7718,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling a little homesick this week
7719,"<|emo_fear|> That’s horrible. He’s a good kid, I was concerned to read “if he’s alive” but that’s just a guess. "
7720,<|emo_fear|> i feel insecure about it all
7721,<|emo_fear|> i feel uncertain and anxious and even more aware that even though i loved school at first i was never going to be good at what i wanted to do in high school
7722,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared and doubtful
7723,<|emo_fear|> i feel really pressured out there right now but it is working
7724,<|emo_fear|> i feel this strange fear
7725,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit paranoid though and decide to call someone i know to come and pick me up from the school
7726,<|emo_fear|> I had a horrible feeling about this. :(
7727,<|emo_fear|> If only they had been there!
7728,<|emo_fear|> This is a real thing and i'm disturbed
7729,<|emo_fear|> im feeling quite apprehensive at the moment and its entirely possible i ve already gone beyond these levels of nervousness and panic
7730,<|emo_fear|> i feel the cold almost constantly
7734,<|emo_fear|> that was an avoidable injury and a serious one at that point due to his momentum forward and his poor core strength
7735,<|emo_fear|> The last message was particularly disturbing.
7736,<|emo_fear|> So many nights he would wake up screaming and crying in the middle of the night
7737,<|emo_fear|> i began to feel quite shaky and out of sorts
7738,<|emo_fear|> im feeling so freaking terrified
7739,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling shaky and i don t know why
7740,"<|emo_fear|> No, the movie is bad because [NAME] didn't die in the first place"
7741,<|emo_fear|> i start feeling anxious and then i really start trying to put my fears into words
7743,<|emo_fear|> i start to feel suspicious
7744,<|emo_fear|> i honestly feel a bit skeptical
7745,<|emo_fear|> I'm a little afraid to ask this one now that it's happened.... but do you know what number is?
7746,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless and out there
7747,<|emo_fear|> i hate feeling that scared and alone
7748,<|emo_fear|> i feel very helpless and ashamed because i could just tell someone but now im saying oh the horror
7749,<|emo_fear|> That's quite a bit worse tbh
7750,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling uncertain as of late
7751,<|emo_fear|> i want to be scared of the future but i can t be scared of my own limitations
7752,<|emo_fear|> i do not see these emotions or feelings but i feel them like a hot knife through my heart it always makes me jump but i cannot move away from them it makes me feel afraid
7754,<|emo_fear|> i did however feel as though i was quite uncertain about the whole thing
7755,<|emo_fear|> Not exactly a healthy sign for someone in their 30s though.
7756,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel frightened or anything like that
7757,<|emo_fear|> i feel apprehensive about the project
7758,<|emo_fear|> i would feel very overwhelmed if he did not call
7759,<|emo_fear|> i feel this way about him
7760,<|emo_fear|> i feel less terrified around him and more hopeful of his strength and purpose
7761,<|emo_fear|> i feel very nervous about the future
7762,<|emo_fear|> i was on my first day of being in college and it was almost exactly 2 weeks after i had started and i was really feeling very anxious to go
7763,<|emo_fear|> im in a place now where i feel reluctant to leave the house
7764,<|emo_fear|> That's really terrifying. You have no idea what effect that has had on you.
7765,<|emo_fear|> The way they are handling things is incredible disgusting.
7766,<|emo_fear|> i feel slightly intimidated by the thought of coming here to speak to this person
7767,"<|emo_fear|> i don t expect anyone to understand, im really just saying that it s hard to tell by someone who has never experienced it"
7768,<|emo_fear|> It's like I can't imagine how scary that was
7769,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling quite intimidated when it comes to learning a new system or something
7771,<|emo_fear|> I’m just scared to see what happens
7772,<|emo_fear|> i feel uncomfortable in them and feel like its cheating
7773,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little nervous around him
7774,<|emo_fear|> The problem I had was his body language when he lunged at [NAME]. His hands were raised skyward as well for balance.
7775,"<|emo_fear|> If you're as ugly as you say you are, you definitely aren't as ugly as you say you are."
7776,"<|emo_fear|> Oh, those dreadful things. My grandmother did them. They were awful."
7777,"<|emo_fear|> The only one to blame, is [NAME] herself I think "
7778,<|emo_fear|> i started wondering if i am feeling afraid of something because i couldnt imagine ever being afraid in my life but i quickly found that it is the ability to look into my fear
7780,<|emo_fear|> They are actually insane.
7781,<|emo_fear|> i didn t feel alarmed by this
7782,<|emo_fear|> im feeling afraid as i read this
7783,"<|emo_fear|> My biggest fear is catching him with the beer, he knows he's under investigation/areas of concern"
7784,<|emo_fear|> i feel confused worried anxious or upset about something
7785,<|emo_fear|> That sounds awful. Do you have any idea where they could find it?
7786,<|emo_fear|> i feel more nervous about the process than the reading itself
7787,<|emo_fear|> im feeling doubtful and anxious
7788,<|emo_fear|> i feel more awkward with him than with the other girl my best friend the other girl came to me and said im fine but im feeling nervous
7789,<|emo_fear|> i really do not want to let myself feel pressured to come to meet her
7790,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure and frightened
7791,"<|emo_fear|> As someone with autism, I fear the exact same thing."
7792,<|emo_fear|> i do not feel too paranoid or doubtful but i worry that i have not been very helpful
7793,<|emo_fear|> i wasnt feeling pressured that much like when i was in school
7794,"<|emo_fear|> He was shot and killed outside of a convenience store, while holding a BB gun."
7796,<|emo_fear|> i find myself feeling apprehensive
7797,<|emo_fear|> It would also be extremely dangerous to fly
7798,<|emo_fear|> i feel very shaken
7799,<|emo_fear|> i also feel a bit paranoid
7800,<|emo_fear|> i feel insecure because there is none
7801,<|emo_fear|> i can feel her inching and trying to find her way through the strange crevasse
7802,<|emo_fear|> This seems crazy. I bet she would love this. Maybe [NAME] wants her to run for president in 2020?
7804,<|emo_fear|> I never felt anything and then your mom called you a horrible person because you didn't hug your dad.
7805,<|emo_fear|> im feeling really paranoid and nervous
7806,<|emo_fear|> ive been trying to go off my amp about things i feel are so dangerous
7807,<|emo_fear|> This is horrible... the only good news is that the baby is expected to survive.
7808,<|emo_fear|> i feel so doubtful and doubtful what about everything is good?
7809,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit shaken up
7810,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling nervous and not having anything to prove
7811,<|emo_fear|> i feel nervous and anxious about it
7812,<|emo_fear|> This is so horrifying. I just had a panic attack thinking about it.
7813,<|emo_fear|> i want to make sure we focus on making sure i understand the issues you feel i will be more sensitive and sensitive in the future because my understanding is changing
7814,<|emo_fear|> When you get too high that you can't ride off into the sunset.
7815,<|emo_fear|> i do believe this is what the church is afraid of because they already feel threatened by internet culture
7816,<|emo_fear|> Oh man... there was a horrible accident
7817,<|emo_fear|> I've had sleep paralysis once and it really sucks
7818,<|emo_fear|> i feel extremely nervous
7819,<|emo_fear|> I’m afraid because I’m too poor to see a doctor.
7820,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling reluctant about everything
7822,<|emo_fear|> This is so horrifying But true!
7824,<|emo_fear|> i want to feel afraid on this earth
7825,"<|emo_fear|> Yeah, the first day feels a little weird."
7826,<|emo_fear|> im being told to calm down by everyone at school and that im being too loud and rude to other people in the same situations
7827,<|emo_fear|> i was trying not to feel scared
7828,<|emo_fear|> A lot of these creeps would rather have YOU believe that [NAME] and [NAME] areags than telling the truth.
7829,<|emo_fear|> i feel apprehensive about the future
7830,<|emo_fear|> Not all men are harassers. Some don't believe harassment actually benefits them in anyway.
7831,"<|emo_fear|> Lol, just gonna name my issue right now is the awkwardness of this. "
7832,<|emo_fear|> I’m scared for y’all saying the same thing.
7833,<|emo_fear|> i feel skeptical of any attempt to provide some sort of an answer
7834,"<|emo_fear|> Yeah I had them, when I was first discovering horror. Now these are the only ones I keep seeing"
7835,<|emo_fear|> i still feel a lot of uncertain thoughts and concerns about many things in my life
7836,<|emo_fear|> i feel so insecure now
7837,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling anxious and worried a few times a day and i am not sure why
7838,<|emo_fear|> i feel frightened that we will never get to see it in the theater again
7839,<|emo_fear|> i would love to be able to take all my anxiety and nervousness and move on to feeling ecstatic and joyful
7840,"<|emo_fear|> Oh, no! Don't play that game with his friends!"
7841,<|emo_fear|> This is so scary to know that she still has it. One day you're not creepy at all!
7843,<|emo_fear|> Because you are an idiot.
7845,<|emo_fear|> This is a really cute drawing of [NAME]
7846,"<|emo_fear|> No deal, abort, abort is raised, abort"
7847,<|emo_fear|> i still remember feeling nervous and just feeling helpless
7848,<|emo_fear|> i had been feeling strange
7849,<|emo_fear|> The double standard. Sending amp chick pics and songs and being and all.. is making the creepy guy think he's a creepy boy lmao
7850,<|emo_fear|> i feel really scared
7851,<|emo_fear|> That is terrible news. What a nightmare.
7852,<|emo_fear|> i just feel helpless and it s lonely when i dont know any
7854,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared actually
7855,<|emo_fear|> i feel doubtful now
7856,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little anxious about how things are going to be tomorrow morning
7857,<|emo_fear|> i always feel pressured to make an honest and truthful statement as a new mom especially when someone is close to me is telling me what i need to be doing
7858,"<|emo_fear|> >and it’s been made painfully clear that she hates me as a person. Wow, that’s terrifying"
7859,<|emo_fear|> i can feel terrified at that point
7860,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite nervous about doing too much too soon
7862,<|emo_fear|> i have been feeling overwhelmed with everything that has been happening around me
7863,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite apprehensive
7864,<|emo_fear|> What a horror.
7865,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid of getting killed
7866,<|emo_fear|> i feel anxious because we still have this problem
7867,"<|emo_fear|> No. They are bad because ""we can't afford it"" and people are scared of losing their homes."
7868,<|emo_fear|> im feeling anxious and anxious and anxious
7869,<|emo_fear|> Lol I'd think I saw that previous comment as creepy and weird...
7870,"<|emo_fear|> My whole life’s been a lie. I still love being happy, but this makes me sad. "
7871,"<|emo_fear|> She's been getting very loud lately, scary."
7872,<|emo_fear|> i feel nervous and anxious just reading those words
7873,<|emo_fear|> i feel really doubtful and just really unsure of everything
7874,<|emo_fear|> i feel apprehensive in a way because i am not used to being anxious before something ever happens as its something i have felt before

7878,<|emo_fear|> i didnt expect to feel so nervous
7879,<|emo_fear|> i feel more shaky amp a lot more unsure
7880,"<|emo_fear|> Your right, I'm afraid I'm completely off my rocker."
7882,<|emo_fear|> i feel shy and uncertain of my identity
7883,<|emo_fear|> I'm literally sick to my stomach from this.
7884,<|emo_fear|> im not sure how else to describe this feeling of hopelessness and failure on the part of mr
7885,"<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid of that happening to me. I'm living with it right now, and I'm not happy. "
7886,<|emo_fear|> i felt so indecisive
7889,<|emo_fear|> This is horrifying.
7890,<|emo_fear|> That’s weird
7892,<|emo_fear|> i feel less anxious when i try to do things for myself
7893,<|emo_fear|> i want to feel assured that there will always be a place where i can be safe and where i am where i belong
7894,<|emo_fear|> It's a terrible way! Not sure what would happen to your tooth.
7895,"<|emo_fear|> This actually scared me, my 1/2in thick sheet of tempered glass is the only thing between me and a fall."
7896,"<|emo_fear|> It's so creepy, I almost want to run away."
7897,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure and disoriented
7898,<|emo_fear|> The monster!
7899,<|emo_fear|> of course. there was always the chance that this game would be the one to finally test nashville and finally end a frustrating streak of losing to them
7900,<|emo_fear|> i feel very suspicious as i haven t seen any of the guys here
7901,<|emo_fear|> i feel tortured with indecisive thoughts
7902,<|emo_fear|> i feel frightened to have any contact with people
7903,"<|emo_fear|> [NAME] has been talking this week about not going to the All Star break. [NAME] has been the one not going. [NAME] seems to be the one who's afraid of missing it, but I think both will do it."
7904,"<|emo_fear|> I'm not scared, I'm actually very happy! :)"
7905,<|emo_fear|> Who the hell thought he was dead.
7906,"<|emo_fear|> This is scary and so very sad. Eleven??? A baby! I was still building forts. I weep for this child, his family, and the fortifications they will use to protect them."
7907,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling worried because i am not sure if he is sincere but i do know that he wouldnt want me to be the only doctor in our family
7908,<|emo_fear|> i have been feeling a little hesitant about whether or not to buy this and it had been a lovely vacation as a total stranger friend though a stranger and a total stranger
7909,<|emo_fear|> i start feeling so dazed
7910,"<|emo_fear|> Omg, the bra hanging out of her bra was definitely a horrible idea."
7911,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel intimidated by a situation when i actually have others telling me what to do
7912,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure about his trust
7913,<|emo_fear|> i feel so overwhelmed im afraid it will never happen
7915,<|emo_fear|> i feel uncertain of my place in this life
7916,<|emo_fear|> I’m afraid you have yet again proven that you are a terrible person with extremely poor social skills. I hate Twitter.
7917,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little afraid for you
7918,<|emo_fear|> i still dont feel like ive been fully truthful with my life and i feel guilty to myself all the time
7919,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant to tell people how to approach the therapist
7920,<|emo_fear|> i actually feel a bit apprehensive about this
7921,<|emo_fear|> I'm so scared and want to go back.
7922,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling rather agitated as i watched these figures walking around
7923,<|emo_fear|> i feel nervous about getting an appointment with the doctor that i need
7924,<|emo_fear|> That is so creepy.
7925,<|emo_fear|> i feel very hesitant posting these things because im afraid im gonna get said wrong
7927,<|emo_fear|> I know the feeling
7928,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling skeptical
7930,<|emo_fear|> This scares me because I'm a [RELIGION] conservative.
7932,<|emo_fear|> That's one vicious cat
7933,<|emo_fear|> The sad part of this is I was scared for that white building.
7934,"<|emo_fear|> Whoa, that's quite possibly the most reckless way to get a car to stop. "
7935,<|emo_fear|> I'm scared that I might die alone
7936,<|emo_fear|> I am afraid he has a very narrow field of vision
7938,<|emo_fear|> i feel this makes me a lot less trusting of people as someone and if they dont like it i have that power over them
7939,<|emo_fear|> Oh my [NAME]. Please don't ever say that about me again.
7940,<|emo_fear|> That's gonna end horribly for him.
7941,<|emo_fear|> How awful.
7942,<|emo_fear|> i have always been afraid of being that person that is completely fearless and confident in my feelings
7943,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite hesitant writing about ken
7944,<|emo_fear|> I feel so sad for that little girl. Maybe one day she will look back and realize that what she did was right :)
7945,<|emo_fear|> My wife is in her 30s with no kids and elderly. She doesn't want a ring or a brony sub. :(
7946,<|emo_fear|> i feel the most terrified and anxious about running out with a small amount
7947,<|emo_fear|> i feel shy for trusting you
7948,<|emo_fear|> I think I'm hearing voices. The only way to describe it isally creepy.
7949,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure and scared
7950,<|emo_fear|> i had a feeling about him but was more than relieved to see how good it feels to be under his wing
7951,<|emo_fear|> i have a feeling is that they just wanted this for their own history lesson in the wake of the terrible accident that is the rex car
7953,<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid the same.
7954,<|emo_fear|> I have had sleep paralysis once and it is really bad.
7955,<|emo_fear|> He literally fell out of a 14 storey office tower in downtown Toronto.
7956,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling nervous anxious and sad because the baby was tiny
7957,<|emo_fear|> I'm scared for the [NAME] and [NAME] relationship...
7958,<|emo_fear|> i feel like i could have run away i dont know where its going to eventually lead me to but it has me so scared
7959,<|emo_fear|> I'm gonna have to die here and now. Sorry for late response.
7960,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little insecure
7961,"<|emo_fear|> Yeah, and it's scary. I'm so sorry that you had to go through that, man. "
7962,<|emo_fear|> I have terrible back pain so that makes it even worse. I need pain killers and I'm already on them.
7963,<|emo_fear|> i began to feel a little bit paranoid
7964,<|emo_fear|> i feel terrified because i know hes not running away
7965,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling a little skeptical but am confident
7966,<|emo_fear|> What a complete shite post omg
7967,<|emo_fear|> i will tell you my story why did im feel frightened
7968,<|emo_fear|> I'm worried the kid may have anxiety or depression which then leads to self harm
7971,<|emo_fear|> She’s scary
7972,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im the one who is scared
7973,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid that someone who i know well is being used as a tool by an evil person
7974,"<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid I have the same fear, but in real life I'm pretty scares too."
7975,<|emo_fear|> My fault =(
7976,<|emo_fear|> Is it weird that I only got to see the Good Place and then Bad Place? Is this my first visit to the Bad Place yet?
7977,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling very distressed when they came in
7979,<|emo_fear|> im feeling skeptical and unsure about this
7980,<|emo_fear|> i did something that i almost certainly shouldn t have done and you made me feel terrifying because you did something that would have felt a lot more bearable if i had done it
7981,<|emo_fear|> i was a woman and it still makes me feel uncomfortable when i look in the mirror and see a man or have a woman talk to me like this
7982,<|emo_fear|> That face is one of the scariest I've ever seen.
7983,<|emo_fear|> i didnt feel intimidated or overwhelmed
7984,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] would hate it
7985,<|emo_fear|> i feel so scared to tell her this
7986,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling anxious as i rushed through the door
7987,<|emo_fear|> i feel more anxious about the whole thing lately
7989,<|emo_fear|> I've been using coconut oil for years and it is the most terrible thing I've ever experienced. I'm so sorry that you're experiencing this.
7990,<|emo_fear|> I would have probably walked straight out. It's terrifying.
7991,<|emo_fear|> i feel a strange calm rising within me
7992,<|emo_fear|> i am starting to feel skeptical that it doesnt matter a lot
7994,"<|emo_fear|> The one you don't have to read to conclusion is the sad part. I think a lot more people read the rambling first line, because it makes it more palatable"
7995,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im in the weird one where i feel like i should do something in particular but it feels like im going all numb
7996,<|emo_fear|> i woke up this morning feeling very weird and uncomfortable
7997,<|emo_fear|> i feel more anxious and sad for her
7998,<|emo_fear|> And I did not want her to have a family! That would have been so awful.
7999,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] fucking stop
8000,<|emo_fear|> i just do that i feel uncomfortable
8001,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] was awful tonight
8003,<|emo_fear|> I was wondering what that was. They're all so great haha
8004,<|emo_fear|> i just really feel very anxious these days
8005,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling nervous but after seeing how much they love me that hes amazing to the people around him
8006,<|emo_fear|> This made me sad
8008,<|emo_fear|> So much bullshit.
8011,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling nervous of everything
8012,<|emo_fear|> No no she is not. No way they would release that sort of information unless it was with the express purpose of trying to entrap her
8013,<|emo_fear|> That's an ugly nd degree
8014,<|emo_fear|> i can feel the fear and doubt in me he said
8015,<|emo_fear|> This is child abuse. No decent parent would force their kid to starve just because they don’t like what they saw on tv
8016,<|emo_fear|> i can feel my way out of being scared by this man
8017,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel scared of anything but i do still fear my own power
8018,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very apprehensive
8019,<|emo_fear|> i have been trying to go on a romantic date and i am always scared
8020,<|emo_fear|> i feel weird doing this but it s one of these projects i really wish i had a good camera
8021,<|emo_fear|> Oh [NAME] this is horrible. I'm so sorry that happened (I hope you are doing better now). Lots of people out there with stories of similar hardship.💕
8022,<|emo_fear|> It sounds spasticated but it's true.
8023,<|emo_fear|> > the reason I have the worst voice is because I like making faces at people lol Go to [NAME] face and smile. You'll see why
8024,"<|emo_fear|> If the title is ""Wherein"" not ""wherein"" :(, im worried that you've never ever read a book by Evelyn Waugh"
8025,<|emo_fear|> im feeling reluctant to tell you that im still not yet convinced it s wrong to do a bsc and my book is being a little bit shaky for a couple reasons but it s definitely a terrible idea
8026,<|emo_fear|> i started feeling weird
8027,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit weird writing about a boy from a different culture and sub culture not wanting to call himself by his first name but i feel a bit better for my job
8028,<|emo_fear|> i feel so shaky a href http euraleighdeeble
8029,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure of my footing
8030,<|emo_fear|> It is scary to think that we as humans are capable of such terrible things.
8032,<|emo_fear|> i feel terrified but optimistic
8033,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel frightened or even anxious
8034,<|emo_fear|> i feel terrified and im not sure what to do
8035,<|emo_fear|> i remember feeling nervous and unsure before i saw him
8036,<|emo_fear|> i can take the pain and struggle out feeling helpless and terrified
8037,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel apprehensive when it comes to going out
8038,<|emo_fear|> Because we’re idiots.
8039,<|emo_fear|> i feel so uncertain about
8040,<|emo_fear|> Oh and now vini is down
8042,<|emo_fear|> i feel very distressed about it
8043,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling overwhelmed with many things and i couldnt think what to do
8046,"<|emo_fear|> This is scary, and I don't know what to say. We'll probably never know until we're all dead."
8047,<|emo_fear|> Ah the high ground where my heart once was.
8048,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little apprehensive as i start to come home
8049,"<|emo_fear|> Oh look, another one for your collection!"
8050,<|emo_fear|> The only thing worse than this is a fake lance
8051,<|emo_fear|> i do feel anxious at work
8052,<|emo_fear|> i woke up feeling shaky afraid of what could happen if i didnt get the help i needed and was scared of my brain
8053,<|emo_fear|> I can't imagine ever being married in the present day.
8055,"<|emo_fear|> The problem is, I'm not a ""progressive"". I'm a ""less extreme"" person, by your standards. "
8056,<|emo_fear|> When your entire body shudders and flinches...
8057,<|emo_fear|> i feel like a nervous wreck
8058,"<|emo_fear|> In other words, it is horribly dangerous when done under questionable circumstances."
8059,<|emo_fear|> i feel more insecure than ever
8060,<|emo_fear|> He's scary
8061,<|emo_fear|> i do feel worried though
8062,<|emo_fear|> I had a nightmare about this too.
8063,<|emo_fear|> i just know that when something terrifying happens in there i feel helpless
8064,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared as i try to remember that this is a wonderful party that we are going to have
8065,<|emo_fear|> i feel more anxious than i have for a long time
8066,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little insecure about it all
8067,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid because i dont know how
8068,<|emo_fear|> i didn t feel scared of an attack rather i found it less than terrifying
8069,<|emo_fear|> Oh this poor sap
8070,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling somewhat uncertain about my current relationship
8071,<|emo_fear|> i didnt want to feel creepy
8072,<|emo_fear|> Damn I didn’t know [NAME] would be this self centered as soon as he was admitted. That’s a big red flag.
8073,<|emo_fear|> I just got scared reading your flair
8074,<|emo_fear|> It's a test. Kill me some more intelligent enemies.
8075,<|emo_fear|> The saddest thing is that hes 5'11.
8076,<|emo_fear|> I'm wondering if that happens. I feel like that would be a pretty bad thing to do if they ever find out :(
8077,<|emo_fear|> im feeling more nervous and uncertain than ever about the future
8078,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling rather skeptical
8079,<|emo_fear|> I’m dying! Scary stuff
8080,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid of being seen by others
8081,<|emo_fear|> of afraid to take our children to the park
8082,<|emo_fear|> It wasnt an exact copy..
8084,<|emo_fear|> i feel kind of hesistant not like im not sure how to act anymore
8086,<|emo_fear|> I don't see a lot of vaccinated kids but I've seen lots of un vaccinated kids... vaccine damaged kids.
8087,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little bit scared that my trust would be violated
8088,<|emo_fear|> i had been feeling really pressured by my teacher
8089,<|emo_fear|> Well now I’m afraid I might actually get chickenpox
8090,"<|emo_fear|> I have been called ugly, fat and even a Heretic."
8091,"<|emo_fear|> What a disgusting and woeful list, to be sure. But I am glad someone posted it."
8092,<|emo_fear|> i feel like its rude
8094,<|emo_fear|> i feeling less terrified of people now
8095,<|emo_fear|> My fault too for not anticipating this attack
8096,<|emo_fear|> I'm just afraid it's going to get a little weird..
8097,<|emo_fear|> i have been feeling quite anxious lately because im scared that my heart is not where it should be
8098,<|emo_fear|> I didn't know there was a fine for disturbing a grave
8099,<|emo_fear|> i am just feeling scared of the future
8100,<|emo_fear|> i can feel myself starting to get scared and then it just stops
8101,<|emo_fear|> i feel so insecure and self conscious
8102,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling nervous and worry the most as i will almost certainly lose if i do
8103,<|emo_fear|> i have a feeling that i will be a bit of a weirdo at the college

8108,<|emo_fear|> He has a very public safety background which scares me a lot.
8109,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] what an idiot
8110,<|emo_fear|> The only cringe I have is watching this person try to pretend they're not a creep.
8112,<|emo_fear|> i was still feeling fearful but hadnt yet felt up to it
8114,"<|emo_fear|> Well, at least it's not an old man telling a young child his birthday."
8115,<|emo_fear|> Damn that’s a real article right there
8116,<|emo_fear|> Lol kill me now
8117,"<|emo_fear|> ""Dude what a crazy story"""
8118,<|emo_fear|> i woke up at the age of which i have no memory and it was only then i realized what was on my mind for feeling so unsure
8119,<|emo_fear|> My girlfriend tried to kill me with a blunt object many times. She threatened to hurt me with a knife if I didn't let her out of my house anymore.
8120,<|emo_fear|> It scared me just reading your flair
8121,<|emo_fear|> i woke up feeling very skeptical about the whole thing
8122,<|emo_fear|> I’m with [NAME] on this one. Scary stuff.
8123,<|emo_fear|> I got this from an old [RELIGION] handbook. It's scary.
8124,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little intimidated and excited
8125,<|emo_fear|> i see you i feel frantic thinking about it for the next day
8127,"<|emo_fear|> It's weird because when I have sleep paralysis, the camera just pans right out to where I am when I just have a nightmare. It also looks fake since the image looks like it has been refreshed on my phone. "
8129,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little hesitant
8131,<|emo_fear|> i start feeling terrified
8132,<|emo_fear|> i feel like this is a little bit rushed and thats ok
8133,<|emo_fear|> When has the state not been pressured enough to change labor laws!!
8134,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling insecure with my camera
8135,<|emo_fear|> I remember looking back and feeling horror and shame
8136,"<|emo_fear|> of course. this is the reality. there are those of us who still hold onto the idea of peaceful change, but then there are those who believe the only way to peaceful change is through violence and brutality."
8137,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] has lost his mind.
8138,<|emo_fear|> this just made me feel sick watching the original series
8139,<|emo_fear|> i know of people who feel pressured to sign up for services the day a claim opens for its processing
8140,<|emo_fear|> i love going out in treacherous weather and there are times where i feel like a helpless rooster
8141,<|emo_fear|> I had a near-fatal allergic reaction to a box of mince pies a few years ago.

8143,<|emo_fear|> i feel so insecure and nervous im gonna lose everything i have and my sanity
8144,<|emo_fear|> i think im so terrified now because my life feels so uncertain and uncertain and unknown and i can t even begin to prepare myself for the future
8145,<|emo_fear|> We are scared that the new laws will be used to target religious minorities - there would be so many mosques vulnerable.
8146,<|emo_fear|> i have gone through this many times my feelings of having been emotionally assaulted by the experience have only magnified my own sense of being helpless in this area
8147,<|emo_fear|> Oh no! Looks like your bed is smelling funny

8169,<|emo_fear|> i really feel quite shaky
8170,<|emo_fear|> I have been called a horrible name and have even had people call me ugly. I can tell that this is from their perspective.
8171,<|emo_fear|> I've always been afraid of giant squid. I've never actually tried though.
8172,"<|emo_fear|> What a weird, almost creepy, game. "
8173,<|emo_fear|> I'm literally screaming.
8174,<|emo_fear|> i also feel quite fearful for them in public
8175,<|emo_fear|> i feel agitated now
8176,<|emo_fear|> i think the general feeling of terrified is more with the adults

8180,<|emo_fear|> i feel very frightened because i actually think i should go there
8182,<|emo_fear|> i feel like ive been scared to post this

8185,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit apprehensive to see if he replies
8186,<|emo_fear|> i feel apprehensive about this
8187,<|emo_fear|> i feel nervous but i think im in a safe place
8188,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im constantly on the cusp of something terrifying but the moment that panic sets in it is what i fear the most
8189,<|emo_fear|> This was so terrible
8190,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little scared about it
8191,<|emo_fear|> They look like little puddles of makeup.

8203,<|emo_fear|> i just remember feeling like a dumb ass for trusting you
8205,<|emo_fear|> i can feel shaken insecure feeling like im on dangerous unknown territory
8206,"<|emo_fear|> I’ve never heard about this, I’m scared."
8207,<|emo_fear|> i did find myself feeling quite emotional watching this one
8208,<|emo_fear|> [NAME]. They’re terrible afraid to give up a goal so they are happy to give up the lead early.
8209,<|emo_fear|> i remember feeling very overwhelmed that morning
8210,<|emo_fear|> You are disturbed
8211,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant saying it when i feel more intelligent than most
8212,<|emo_fear|> i began to feel really fearful for one simple thing that i realized in truth is not about money
8213,<|emo_fear|> i feel very vulnerable because the only thing that i do know how to take care of is my cats
8214,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared to let them into my house
8215,<|emo_fear|> i can see how that could make me feel creepy
8216,<|emo_fear|> i just started feeling overwhelmed
8217,<|emo_fear|> i feel so helpless and helpless when i am unsure about things

8220,"<|emo_fear|> I'll keep the secret. But if she Does say No, I'll find out..."
8221,<|emo_fear|> i began to feel scared just thinking about it
8222,"<|emo_fear|> It's weird because sometimes I think I just have this Niemi thing going on, but I just really feel like they do."
8223,<|emo_fear|> Ah true blue love

8225,<|emo_fear|> i am also feeling pretty scared about my ability to come any further in these
8226,<|emo_fear|> i feel insecure because of it
8227,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared about being away from those people
8228,<|emo_fear|> I did this with my daughter for a year.... scary.
8229,<|emo_fear|> i do feel anxious often
8230,<|emo_fear|> They have no idea.
8231,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared to even look at it
8232,"<|emo_fear|> I'm a mom with an interest in dinosaurs, I can tell from looking at this that these guys are into it. "
8233,<|emo_fear|> i don t know what exactly to do now what to feel afraid of i don t know how scared of what
8234,<|emo_fear|> im feeling scared now
8235,<|emo_fear|> But I'm not gonna lie. I absolutely love the series but... what if he's just saying that because he wants it to be successful?
8236,<|emo_fear|> i just feel completely unsure
8237,<|emo_fear|> i think he may come away feeling less scared because of who im saying
8238,<|emo_fear|> i couldnt help feeling a bit overwhelmed and i did too
8239,"<|emo_fear|> It just seemed so crazy to me before, but now it's been a while. I hope it all works out for you."
8240,<|emo_fear|> when i was 15
8241,<|emo_fear|> i didn t feel terrified
8242,<|emo_fear|> im feeling apprehensive just to get in before sunday night
8243,"<|emo_fear|> Ah, [NAME]! What a nightmare."
8246,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling more and more insecure
8247,<|emo_fear|> i have had to stop and think about the situation again and my body starts feeling anxious about this
8248,<|emo_fear|> i cannot help but feel that he is so fearful for us
8249,<|emo_fear|> i have always been afraid of feeling this way until i feel the world around me and am completely trusting
8250,"<|emo_fear|> My son said his ""pal"" made him cry so much. She's been crying in our room every night since we moved there."
8251,<|emo_fear|> i have noticed my hands and i feel reluctant to describe my hands and how they have changed in general from the picture i had in mind
8252,<|emo_fear|> I had the same fear and was terrified every time I walked into that building.
8253,<|emo_fear|> This is so scary to know that you went through that kind of abuse. You can't imagine what that must have been like for them.
8254,<|emo_fear|> i am starting to feel quite hesitant about how much further i should go
8255,<|emo_fear|> im now feeling anxious
8256,<|emo_fear|> i also feel apprehensive about leaving soon
8257,<|emo_fear|> This is so scary to know that you went through such a thing. Out of you goes all hope of ever being an ex partner with a serious psychopath.
8258,<|emo_fear|> i have had in the last few months been so bad and yet i have been very excited to say that i feel safe in my home and in the world
8259,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared by everyone around me right now
8260,<|emo_fear|> My worst fear after getting a tattooed was having it done after I got injured.
8261,<|emo_fear|> i have a feeling he might do something dangerous
8262,"<|emo_fear|> The thing that scares me about these ""self-identifying"" groups is that they're often heavily financially and morally dubious."
8263,<|emo_fear|> It’s so scary! I have no idea what to do!
8264,<|emo_fear|> i am not feeling anxious but i do not feel anywhere near as rich in general
8265,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling a little nervous about the whole thing
8266,<|emo_fear|> i didn t know if i should feel horror or sadness for them
8267,<|emo_fear|> My balls shrunk up looking at those
8268,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid of it i go to the internet
8269,<|emo_fear|> i came home feeling terrified of coming back
8271,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit helpless because when i get my hands on a gun or something it just never works
8272,<|emo_fear|> i feel so scared that my job will be threatened
8273,<|emo_fear|> i feel fearful about my own safety and the safety of others
8275,<|emo_fear|> i feel strange about this
8276,<|emo_fear|> He was so horrible
8277,<|emo_fear|> i feel pressured by the media but i have this confidence that i can do this
8278,"<|emo_fear|> [NAME] would love her! ""Do You Believe in Santa Claus?"" "
8279,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling quite nervous about it
8280,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling really distressed to be feeling this way
8281,<|emo_fear|> i feel very doubtful because i dont believe thats what the church wants to hear
8282,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling very uncertain about things
8283,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared and doubtful about everything
8284,<|emo_fear|> i feel like i should be fearful of the future because i actually dont know
8285,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling nervous and unsure of how i should act
8286,<|emo_fear|> i got off at once and walked on without feeling scared or anxious
8287,<|emo_fear|> My brain hurts...
8288,"<|emo_fear|> Oh no, my poor baby"
8290,"<|emo_fear|> Oh my [NAME], your therapist sucks."
8291,<|emo_fear|> i feel nervous for him because that is how his parents made him feel
8292,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling doubtful and then i got that call
8293,<|emo_fear|> > and the media cried murder when it came out that [NAME] and [NAME] were having an affair. That really broke their hearts.
8294,<|emo_fear|> im making it feel as if i m making some kind of shaky movie
8295,<|emo_fear|> im feeling shy to get it posted
8296,<|emo_fear|> i feel so helpless to take action over just a few few
8297,<|emo_fear|> i see how this affects me i feel insecure that i ve seen it done wrong
8298,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling a bit nervous about the whole thing
8300,<|emo_fear|> i feel uncomfortable even writing about the stuff that i am passionate about
8301,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little afraid and somewhat overwhelmed
8302,<|emo_fear|> What a weird way to sign...
8303,<|emo_fear|> When I called my mom today and told her what had happened I got this text
8305,<|emo_fear|> i actually feel pressured to do so and are actually terrified of saying no
8306,<|emo_fear|> She did it again! I'm scared for their kids. I'm calling the police and posting them on Facebook.
8307,<|emo_fear|> I get terrified just reading your flair
8308,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling pretty reluctant until i got on a flight to elmonia
8309,<|emo_fear|> This is truly terrifying!
8311,<|emo_fear|> Oh yeah.
8312,<|emo_fear|> I felt my heart sink when I saw what she did to [NAME]
8313,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] is dangerous inside
8314,<|emo_fear|> i can feel more comfortable supporting myself and a couple new friends are coming in
8315,<|emo_fear|> Damn she's a horrible play-by-play commentator
8316,"<|emo_fear|> No, you're right. How about ""the government knows we're here"" "
8317,<|emo_fear|> If you keep doing this you're not keeping me safe. I can’t see this getting stopped any time soon.
8318,<|emo_fear|> i actually feel pretty terrified about that
8319,<|emo_fear|> ive also heard how terrible of people are who dont like being asked questions and just act normal without any awareness of the consequences of their actions
8320,<|emo_fear|> i know i ve been asked already but what do i do and im just feeling like it s best to be silent on this point
8322,<|emo_fear|> The lack of female-led space in video games is quite worrying.
8323,<|emo_fear|> That is really creepy. Is that a baby in there?
8324,<|emo_fear|> i just feel terrified
8325,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] should get a little scares too
8327,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling pretty skeptical
8328,<|emo_fear|> i always feel very apprehensive when i look at this picture
8329,<|emo_fear|> i feel slightly shy to post what could be considered extreme content here
8330,<|emo_fear|> But it's creepy
8331,<|emo_fear|> i feel that she is scared and anxious
8332,"<|emo_fear|> I would also be afraid he would say ""no"" like that for me."
8333,<|emo_fear|> im feeling scared tonight
8334,<|emo_fear|> i began feeling skeptical about it when it made the top picks for lottery
8335,<|emo_fear|> i feel very vulnerable and afraid
8336,<|emo_fear|> I’m hearing terrible things about that game right now. Personally I enjoyed it.
8337,<|emo_fear|> Omg does anyone have a video of this happening
8338,<|emo_fear|> > it's doubtful that most people who are dissatisfied with their work-life balance in the corporate world consider themselves feminists.
8339,<|emo_fear|> This is a terrible idea. I hate children
8340,"<|emo_fear|> I'm scared that I'm about as ""old"" as they come..."
8341,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared scared of everything
8343,<|emo_fear|> i can go on and on and never feel tortured or depressed
8344,<|emo_fear|> i was still feeling kind of shocked and doubtful about the experience as he'd reassured me nothing was wrong but it had never once made me feel like i was handled fairly well by him either right or wrong
8345,<|emo_fear|> Oh so it was one of my nightmares..!
8346,<|emo_fear|> i cant help but wonder if i am allowing it to burden me as much as my parents were
8347,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling very nervous anxious
8349,<|emo_fear|> I don't think anyone questions the right of parents to send their own children to private school if that's the option they have (the alternative is private school)
8350,<|emo_fear|> I’m afraid it will turn into a horrible meme
8351,<|emo_fear|> The carpool part scared me away
8352,<|emo_fear|> Yeah.... it's so freaking creepy I couldn't even begin to imagine what could possibly be driving it
8353,<|emo_fear|> You are disgusting
8354,<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid I'm gonna have to come back to that one...the fears of losing too many are too damn great...
8355,"<|emo_fear|> I felt my heart drop. [NAME], your mom is horrible."
8356,<|emo_fear|> i thought i would be able to do but i have been feeling extremely helpless
8357,<|emo_fear|> i dont believe in a divine creator god that will make the world feel dangerous enough to let those who are in need of a hero be vulnerable to danger
8358,<|emo_fear|> i honestly didn t believe she was dead and still didn t really feel the weight of the crimes she was guilty of or the situation her parents were in
8359,<|emo_fear|> I'm on the receiving end of a lot of horrible things on this sub in the past year or two. Some of it is absolutely brutal.
8360,<|emo_fear|> i feel more hesitant to leave
8361,<|emo_fear|> So sorry!
8362,<|emo_fear|> im feeling unsure about my faith
8363,<|emo_fear|> i could give you a list and go in and start making a list by day and then try to get through it and feel like i am not completely exhausted
8364,<|emo_fear|> i feel suspicious when im around people who clearly are not aware of these things
8365,<|emo_fear|> i feel very shaken up about it
8366,<|emo_fear|> i feel less afraid to say things that may seem offensive to some people when i say them
8367,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im getting punished for being an intelligent and able adult
8369,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid that i ve doomed everything and everything
8370,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared when i see the person on the street
8371,<|emo_fear|> i feel like an idiot for trusting anyone here
8373,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little bit terrified of going out again in a year or so
8374,"<|emo_fear|> I'm a weirdo all the time, but I admit, I thought you were being a tad bit more caustic than usual. "
8375,<|emo_fear|> im still feeling shaken up
8376,"<|emo_fear|> I went on my dad's hunting trip last year. It was pretty terrifying. I don't know if I'm alone, but I'd say every family should do it at least once in their life. "
8378,<|emo_fear|> i started to feel agitated
8380,<|emo_fear|> i feel frightened that i could get scared again
8381,<|emo_fear|> i do not feel doubtful
8383,<|emo_fear|> i feel weird just posting pics but im really glad you liked them
8384,<|emo_fear|> i feel fearful and scared just thinking about this
8385,<|emo_fear|> I thought they were afraid of getting burned
8386,<|emo_fear|> i feel nervous now
8388,<|emo_fear|> i feel more afraid of this than i have
8389,<|emo_fear|> So. Damn. Greasy.
8390,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little intimidated and a little scared or anxious or just scared to do it
8391,<|emo_fear|> im feeling indecisive about what im going to do
8392,<|emo_fear|> I'm scared that I'll lose weight and then end up back where I started...
8393,<|emo_fear|> i feel so helpless and hopeless and alone
8394,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im making a huge scene but a scene that hasnt happened yet
8395,<|emo_fear|> i do have a feeling she wont be too impressed
8396,<|emo_fear|> im feeling frightened
8397,<|emo_fear|> i feel helpless and guilty when i fail and fail miserably
8398,<|emo_fear|> i feel more worried about my son and his safety
8399,<|emo_fear|> That’s terrible. I’m probably going to have to try that myself tomorrow. Do you recommend sleeping on your stomach?
8402,<|emo_fear|> i didnt even know i had it and i feel weird writing about it because i know how he feels about it
8403,"<|emo_fear|> That's horrible. You are an amazing mommy to children, I'm so sorry. My heart hurts."
8404,<|emo_fear|> i feel like i am being pressured to be anxious about the future
8405,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared and want to go back
8406,<|emo_fear|> i remember feeling very fearful and worried
8407,<|emo_fear|> i know how it feels to have your eyes bulwarked with lenses when someone is about to pelt you with a ballpoint pen
8408,<|emo_fear|> im definitely feeling anxious these days
8409,<|emo_fear|> Is this the same guy who was afraid of flying into buildings in his older brother's car?
8410,<|emo_fear|> i feel really unsure of myself
8411,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling afraid because i know he cares for more than that
8412,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a bit shaken up about this
8413,<|emo_fear|> i want to show my parents this way of life so that they can be shocked by some things that arent always in their lives
8414,<|emo_fear|> i am already feeling very skeptical about the wisdom of this decision
8415,<|emo_fear|> i feel more paranoid and anxious
8416,<|emo_fear|> i feel so frightened to think that she is going to say sorry
8417,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid to step outside my terraser that im building for children
8418,<|emo_fear|> i can still work out how i feel is a strange way to think and it is not like i could go back and change
8419,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure and disoriented all the time
8420,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared that i will be assaulted by some stranger
8423,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling very apprehensive because i really wanted to go back to her house and see what she was doing with the box it was
8425,<|emo_fear|> i feel so anxious about it all
8426,<|emo_fear|> i feel like a kid who wants to be different but has no idea how
8427,<|emo_fear|> This is so scary and so true. Keep safe!
8428,"<|emo_fear|> [NAME] has been horrible for us all season long, and [NAME] has been worse.. "
8429,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling quite reluctant
8430,<|emo_fear|> i feel that there is a huge amount of anxiety in this world
8431,<|emo_fear|> I feel more frightened everyday
8432,<|emo_fear|> When she was on [NAME]... I remember thinking to myself I wonder if there was a button that would put a picture of [NAME] instead of [NAME]
8433,<|emo_fear|> i feel pretty insecure about my writing at the moment
8435,<|emo_fear|> i went home and had some food for the night then left feeling apprehensive about the whole thing
8436,"<|emo_fear|> They were saying it was only 100mg, and there was also some concern from some friends that it could lead to paranoia, etc. "
8437,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little bit anxious about it
8438,<|emo_fear|> You are disgusting. I hope you die.
8439,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling very shaken up over the whole thing
8440,<|emo_fear|> i feel unsure why my stomach hurts
8441,<|emo_fear|> This gave me chills. He looks like the dad from The Good Place
8442,<|emo_fear|> i think she can really hold her tongue this time it was a real hell of a conversation
8443,<|emo_fear|> > The lack of any consistency in their gameplay is absolutely terrifying.
8444,<|emo_fear|> So scary!
8445,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] I HATE those
8447,<|emo_fear|> i didnt feel pressured or pressured to answer
8448,<|emo_fear|> My condolences!
8449,<|emo_fear|> i have it as a feeling of having survived a terrifying experience
8451,<|emo_fear|> ive never been so nervous to write that much but somehow i felt more nervous to write that for my blog
8452,<|emo_fear|> They say a picture is worth a thousand words. This was more bad than the original post.
8453,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling really reluctant to get back to writing for this blog but i really want to and im eager to do it
8454,<|emo_fear|> This is actually frightening to know that you went through like this
8455,<|emo_fear|> i am inching feeling quite scared
8456,<|emo_fear|> I'm not crying.. you're laughing
8457,<|emo_fear|> What a bummer. That was such a great chance to start young. Not so here. I’m so sorry.
8458,"<|emo_fear|> This is why you should get an earring, it really helps on the neck and temple area."
8459,"<|emo_fear|> And when the fire brigades showed up, they were met with huge numbers of homes devastated. What a nightmare."
8460,<|emo_fear|> im feeling quite reluctant to go on with this because i dont think ill ever want to see how my baby is doing before its death
8461,"<|emo_fear|> Well it was a horribleally terrible idea. She ended up killing a toddler, it was so terrible"
8462,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling a little paranoid about this
8463,<|emo_fear|> It never ends well
8464,<|emo_fear|> i feel kind of helpless
8465,<|emo_fear|> i did not feel overwhelmed by the fact that we were all going to be sharing our lives equally under the circumstances but had certainly not felt overwhelmed by the fact that we were all going to be living together in our family home all over the world
8466,<|emo_fear|> i can t help but feel a little less trusting
8467,"<|emo_fear|> And what about [NAME] who said ""it can wait"" when he was asked about potentially having a future career path? Lmao. Just seems to be an old saying..."
8468,<|emo_fear|> I can totally relate to that but also think we're all just awful people in our own minds sometimes
8469,<|emo_fear|> i feel so dumb if i dont know this stuff
8470,<|emo_fear|> i also had a feeling that she was about to be apprehensive and would look for ways to avoid it
8471,<|emo_fear|> i get all the feelings terrified out of him he will get me all upset
8472,<|emo_fear|> i feel quite frightened
8473,<|emo_fear|>  I was petrified...
8474,<|emo_fear|> You might wonder why I've been sharing this. Well because I wanted you to know a little bit more about my troubled past and why I'm sharing it.
8475,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling nervous that i dont know how i will use this
8476,<|emo_fear|> ive been feeling quite paranoid
8477,<|emo_fear|> Holy fuck.
8478,"<|emo_fear|> I felt kind of bad for laughing at this. Can't say I blame you, but he seems seriously wronged."
8479,"<|emo_fear|> No, we’re scared for [NAME]"
8480,<|emo_fear|> i started feeling suspicious when i looked at all the bags on the table
8481,<|emo_fear|> i feel very strange tonight
8483,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid to leave this house
8484,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] is horrible. I'm so sorry [NAME] is such a monster.
8485,<|emo_fear|> I’m a little afraid of how vulnerable a company that lets you have free food really is
8486,<|emo_fear|> i don t have a good feeling about this
8488,<|emo_fear|> i think i just told you shes terrified
8489,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel terrified by it
8490,<|emo_fear|> Damn i feel you
8491,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling extremely agitated right now
8492,<|emo_fear|> i also felt my heart beat hard in surprise
8493,<|emo_fear|> I've come up with a theory about how he's such a horrible player - that's the only way I know he could've possibly become this way.
8494,<|emo_fear|> im not feeling afraid in the least
8495,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared for them all
8496,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared for them
8497,<|emo_fear|> i feel like i was a bit paranoid and paranoid because i haven t had any scares these days
8498,<|emo_fear|> i feel more timid around people now that i have trust issues
8499,"<|emo_fear|> In Canada, this is called a riding call "
8500,<|emo_fear|> i feel so helpless and hopeless and like i could die right in front of you right now if you didnt take care of me
8501,<|emo_fear|> Omg that's so sad 🤢
8502,<|emo_fear|> I’m so sorry [NAME] is experiencing such deep depression
8503,<|emo_fear|> It’s a horrible sign
8504,<|emo_fear|> i know is feeling paranoid and scared and helpless
8505,"<|emo_fear|> The ""right"" meme includes: “Baldwin” - A guy who had his photo taken with [NAME] so he’s a fame hater!"
8506,<|emo_fear|> i left feeling slightly skeptical
8507,<|emo_fear|> i think i m going to feel overwhelmed and not have time to think properly
8508,<|emo_fear|> i feel very unsure
8509,"<|emo_fear|> Oh [NAME]. Have I ever used ""piggy bank"" wrong? I'm a professional. Very annoyed, at least."
8510,<|emo_fear|> i can take a sip at a moment but i feel reluctant to have a conversation as i don t feel anything in my depths
8511,"<|emo_fear|> Holy crap, the comments on that instagram post are strong."
8512,<|emo_fear|> That’s a horrible take.
8513,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling very reluctant to do that
8514,<|emo_fear|> i feel like i have been a little bit distracted
8515,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit nervous about the whole thing
8516,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling nervous and unsure but after about 2 hours i started to feel calm and reassured
8517,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im a helpless victim
8518,"<|emo_fear|> Your girlfriend just described one of the scariest things she's ever experienced. She is right to be scared, but don't blame her. "
8519,<|emo_fear|> i think it s a fairly uncanny feeling
8520,<|emo_fear|> im just a little scared or just feeling a little uncertain about myself right now
8521,<|emo_fear|> i know it is dangerous to look at this picture
8522,<|emo_fear|> i feel skeptical
8523,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling extremely anxious and depressed so i have decided to write my story from the point of view of the woman i love
8524,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] in the morning. Wrecking company
8525,<|emo_fear|> i feel very frightened now that i know the whole world is watching
8526,<|emo_fear|> i feel overwhelmed about a lot of things that i really love
8527,<|emo_fear|> The last thing they'd want to do is bring in a figurehead whose personality is so fleshed out it genuinely scares me.
8529,<|emo_fear|> i would want her to share that she is happy to give away her beauty for a boy s sake rather than my need to please
8530,<|emo_fear|> i also feel very helpless
8531,"<|emo_fear|> That's horrifying. Imagine a 6'1"", 215 pound forward going on a drive to the basket at the middle of the key. Horrific."
8532,<|emo_fear|> i feel insecure about myself
8533,<|emo_fear|> i dont know i feel helpless but i know that its more because im afraid i don t know
8534,<|emo_fear|> i actually feel a bit skeptical
8535,<|emo_fear|> I'm kinda scared to ask since I don't have a lot of interaction with her but I've heard shes really good at keeping her mouth shut.
8536,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to blog on about it but im afraid you wont be able to understand any of it because i ve given so much for you to read in these posts and i havent even gotten to a full breakfast yet
8537,<|emo_fear|> i just said before feeling so unsure and indecisive this will be a test of our character and character s to be able to keep up with the needs of young girls who are trying to make the next step
8538,<|emo_fear|> i think we have to be very cautious when we talk about such things as these relationships and to my great surprise i am not alone in feeling this way
8539,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared to use my personal credit card because i get identity thieves pretty regularly
8540,<|emo_fear|> i feel pretty terrified and unsure of the future
8541,"<|emo_fear|> I have seen this several times, and it has creeped me out a lot, sometimes making me want to run from it."
8542,<|emo_fear|> i remember feeling a little apprehensive about this
8543,<|emo_fear|> That's a damn good-looking girl!!!
8544,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling nervous again until the call came in at the end of the day and it turned out to be a great help
8545,<|emo_fear|> i feel very reluctant at times to really write when i am not feeling excited
8546,<|emo_fear|> i feel nervous as i start
8547,<|emo_fear|> i cant help but feel this way about my life
8548,<|emo_fear|> i would feel terrified if i were to ever see that image again
8549,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] these are hideous
8550,<|emo_fear|> i didnt want you to feel afraid
8552,<|emo_fear|> It's like your mom told you you're ugly for liking shoes and stuff. It's so creepy and scary.
8554,<|emo_fear|> i left the office feeling overwhelmed and wanting to go home
8555,<|emo_fear|> i did feel that she was a bit skeptical
8556,"<|emo_fear|> I think that’s why [NAME] left because he’s insecure, he thought he could do it"
8557,<|emo_fear|> i didnt feel afraid or worried or anything else
8558,<|emo_fear|> oh it's there btw
8559,<|emo_fear|> Oh god that sound... Can't imagine what that is...
8560,<|emo_fear|> Just got my new job at the age of 20 and i'm in my second year! And I love the job!
8561,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling somewhat uncertain about where all my energy was coming from
8562,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling kind of shaken up and off
8564,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling unsure and nervous about my medical situation
8565,"<|emo_fear|> As much as I would love him to not have a fucking nose, he does. "
8567,<|emo_fear|> i feel anxious more than ever the more
8568,<|emo_fear|> i said no i wont try to hide all of this and how would they feel if i didn t go
8569,<|emo_fear|> What?
8570,<|emo_fear|> She's terrified
8571,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] has to be terrified of getting hit by a pitch
8572,<|emo_fear|> This is the best video ever. Thank you
8573,<|emo_fear|> i feel a delicate sense of danger
8574,<|emo_fear|> Not bad at all
8575,"<|emo_fear|> No its the other way around, you should stop telling people that you've gone through all of the below issues as being scared"
8576,<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid my nightmares are coming true
8577,<|emo_fear|> i feel very uncertain about certain things
8578,"<|emo_fear|> A couple things: 1) it wasn't a hit, it was a fall, and fall injuries are a pretty usual part of ARI's injury history 2) you don't have to be afraid of getting injured if you're going to play"
8579,<|emo_fear|> I have a feeling this one is a tad longer than it should be. Still a great movie. Personally my favorite.
8580,<|emo_fear|> They should just stop broadcasting road games
8581,<|emo_fear|> i feel nervous but i know you only see me as a potential killer
8582,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to tell
8584,<|emo_fear|> I've had sleep paralysis once and had to wake up 3 times in a row to check my balance after I fell asleep.
8585,"<|emo_fear|> ""I've been threatened with execution by an angry old man"""
8586,<|emo_fear|> This is so infuriating.
8587,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very anxious and scared
8588,"<|emo_fear|> No, you said you're sorry for my ""mistake."" Well, you have MY forgiveness of course."
8589,"<|emo_fear|> Oh, my [NAME] I'm so sorry."
8590,<|emo_fear|> i am beginning to feel a bit unsure of the value of my new career and what it brings
8591,<|emo_fear|> That sounds awful.
8592,<|emo_fear|> That sounds worst. I hope you have a great life since that news broke.
8593,<|emo_fear|> the secondhand panic that many of us feel is quite frightening at times
8595,<|emo_fear|>!!!!!!!
8596,<|emo_fear|> It’s sad she’s using makeup for attention...like a makeup artist to a model.
8597,<|emo_fear|> Oh no [NAME] is coming in the near future. I fear that as the ASG approached I was doomed.
8598,<|emo_fear|> This is the only time I've ever felt bad for [NAME]. He seems like such a genuinely nice and decent human being. I don't know how he handled that. 
8599,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared of myself and what other people want from me
8600,<|emo_fear|> i feel more paranoid about it
8602,<|emo_fear|> i feel slightly fearful because im quite certain my boyfriend is not exactly the guy who would do something like this
8603,<|emo_fear|> im just feeling shaky
8604,<|emo_fear|> i didnt even try to take it all in i just did what i needed to do and thats why it felt so shaky
8606,<|emo_fear|> Omg stop posting pics of your cat while you're driving! 🤦🏼‍♀️
8607,<|emo_fear|> i do feel a little vulnerable and anxious and uncertain
8608,<|emo_fear|> I just feel so helpless right now.
8609,<|emo_fear|> i feel more nervous than i have in a very long time
8610,<|emo_fear|> i feel insecure now
8611,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling very anxious this week.
8612,<|emo_fear|> Just got back from an away game and honestly afraid I'm gonna give him a pass tonight
8613,<|emo_fear|> i feel very helpless to stop the nightmare of the mukdad
8614,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a bit weird because he is only supporting two of the main characters
8615,<|emo_fear|> i feel overwhelmed i feel helpless and i feel afraid
8616,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little bit anxious but not really scared
8617,<|emo_fear|> i didnt think it was that awful when its really just been an hours worth of frantic running and breathing and sometimes just simply being in the moment but im not quite sure
8618,<|emo_fear|> i feel skeptical and question the whole thing
8620,<|emo_fear|> i want to stress that it was not like that
8621,<|emo_fear|> i do feel the anxiety for which she is known particularly the fearful anticipation
8622,<|emo_fear|> I saw an Adderall once and it made me feel like screaming.
8623,<|emo_fear|> i cannot begin to describe the terrible way that made me feel while being in the park
8625,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling scared because i thought the police might come and arrest me
8626,<|emo_fear|> i did not feel pressured but asked
8627,<|emo_fear|> i feel so shocked and appalled that she would think such a thing
8628,"<|emo_fear|> That is very disturbing to be sure, and perhaps indicating she'll act unethically during her husband's impeachment."
8629,<|emo_fear|> I’m afraid I’m gonna pick something far more horrendous
8631,"<|emo_fear|> I think about this a lot. I don't want to get pregnant, but my fear is that if I do I won't make it through what I term the ""10+ Year window"". "
8632,<|emo_fear|> It's more like anxiety is used as a tool to control you.
8633,<|emo_fear|> Lol [NAME] haha
8634,<|emo_fear|> i will give you some more examples of how the law treats young girls and women when it is abused and the consequences for these violations are devastating and often devastatingly real
8635,<|emo_fear|> i feel shaken and anxious
8637,<|emo_fear|> It's not my fault everyone asleep in my bed every night has a fever that day.
8638,<|emo_fear|> i was surprised at how clean and organized we were today
8639,"<|emo_fear|> I'm afraid [NAME] is on his way out at some point, he's such a bully that it would be incredibly dangerous for him to keep a clean sheet."
8640,<|emo_fear|> My [NAME] took a tumble from a privileged height. It’s uncertain if he will ever recover.
8641,<|emo_fear|> i just feel very insecure about feeling that insecure
8643,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] has lost it.
8644,<|emo_fear|> i feel suspicious of things as time goes on more and more and so i get distracted more and more
8645,<|emo_fear|> i feel intimidated by the work that has already been done
8646,<|emo_fear|> i feel anxious and not sure if it's the food or the environment
8647,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid and doubtful because i dont know what god is like
8648,<|emo_fear|> The man is dead. The picture is horrifying
8649,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling very doubtful at this point as to whether i would be able to complete the course
8650,<|emo_fear|> i feel apprehensive about it all
8651,"<|emo_fear|> Oh my god, [NAME]!"
8652,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] that has some seriously rough video quality...
8653,"<|emo_fear|> There’s no limit when it comes to owning children, so if you’re an adult, there’s no limit of what you can do to your little one. Worst case scenario, they may one day grow up to become an adult. "
8654,<|emo_fear|> That's terrible. I'm glad to hear this; have you tried deactivating your cookies and searching your internet history?
8656,<|emo_fear|> i wasnt feeling apprehensive
8657,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little shy around him
8658,"<|emo_fear|> I thought I was the only one! I feel terrible for him, but I couldn't not believe it "
8659,"<|emo_fear|> I hate to be that guy, but there's a growing list of players that get the better of you and end up leaving."
8660,<|emo_fear|> This is so scary to think about. I'm so sorry for your friend.
8661,<|emo_fear|> It's extremely scary.
8662,<|emo_fear|> the scary feeling was a strong one
8664,<|emo_fear|> i feel suspicious about the things i think were the only ones there that i could see
8665,<|emo_fear|> i had already spent a lot of time feeling anxious and had lost valuable time the following nights
8666,"<|emo_fear|> Ouch. From what I understand from their rep, they're a fairly new type of business."
8667,<|emo_fear|> i do feel a bit shy as im a bit of a distance person even though im in my late thirties
8668,<|emo_fear|> That is an incredibly dangerous line to walk.
8669,<|emo_fear|> i feel pretty reluctant to leave the house because i hope the housekeeper will not leave you alone when you do
8670,<|emo_fear|> Ouch! My heart! I almost fell off! You have a good one for your room though haha
8671,<|emo_fear|> i would feel scared out there
8672,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared because i dont feel safe enough
8673,<|emo_fear|> i do feel quite anxious about it all
8674,"<|emo_fear|> I'm scared for y'all who may be new here/undeveloped in the area/agriculturally/race/ etc, or similar."
8675,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit hesitant to put anything about it on here
8676,<|emo_fear|> Oh [NAME] how awful
8677,<|emo_fear|> Oh man that's terrible. What are you doing to help?
8678,<|emo_fear|> i feel doubtful and worried
8679,<|emo_fear|> i am at church i feel hesitant and at times not entirely sure of what to say when im nervous
8680,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] is so scary
8681,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] I love my state sometimes
8682,<|emo_fear|> i just wanna get off the floor you know i feel afraid that i m going to start running away from you if i do
8683,<|emo_fear|> I'll kill you
8684,<|emo_fear|> This is why [NAME] and [NAME] have been made to look like lunatics.
8685,<|emo_fear|> i began feeling quite anxious about my progress which was odd considering how long i had spent with the game
8686,<|emo_fear|> The thing that makes this so scary is the fact that it is actually happening. People like this are the real threat to our democracy.
8687,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling quite pressured
8688,<|emo_fear|> This is scary and so very sad. Eleven??? A baby. I was still building forts. I weep for this child.
8689,<|emo_fear|> i feel hesitant to try out this amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp
8690,<|emo_fear|> I wonder what sort of reaction you’re getting for sharing that
8691,<|emo_fear|> im just feeling apprehensive about it
8692,<|emo_fear|> i feel like im being tortured in here
8694,<|emo_fear|> im on it a lot even though im not feeling frantic
8695,<|emo_fear|> im not an emotional person but i feel very uncomfortable with the idea that we are pregnant in this house
8696,<|emo_fear|> i did not want to have such painful feeling so i thought of something that i was feeling very fearful about
8697,<|emo_fear|> i feel anxious when i dont have things to do
8698,<|emo_fear|> It really comes down to the fact that you’re scared and not knowing what to do next.
8699,<|emo_fear|> i didnt know this but i am feeling a bit skeptical about things in the business
8700,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling scared
8701,<|emo_fear|> i feel less scared
8702,<|emo_fear|> i do feel a little delicate about this
8703,<|emo_fear|> i can feel it so very strongly
8705,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to talk about this
8706,<|emo_fear|> im feeling vulnerable and scared of being hurt
8707,<|emo_fear|> i feel terrified of being left alone
8708,<|emo_fear|> Your a disgusting kook.
8709,<|emo_fear|> i honestly feel like im a shy girl and it s weird
8710,<|emo_fear|> i am being a bit worried about not being able to look at the cute girl in the red hat after she asks if im feeling ok
8711,<|emo_fear|> They're all so damn scary
8713,<|emo_fear|> i feel more uncertain and anxious than i have
8714,<|emo_fear|> It is unfortunate that the individuals within these groups are only somewhat aware of them.
8715,<|emo_fear|> I'm sorry you're having these kinds experiences. I hope that you have other experiences in the future that bring you joy and happiness. You are not meant to be a monster. ❤️
8716,<|emo_fear|> i feel anxious and then when i have to go to sleep i have no idea what is going on
8717,<|emo_fear|> I’m scared for you too. That’s definitely a high-level language for an international call center.
8719,<|emo_fear|> Oh [NAME] the horror I know no name for.
8720,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid to look at things because it would scare me away
8721,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling anxious about someones question i think i said to myself that after you and your parents are asleep i don t think this will ever be an issue again
8722,<|emo_fear|> i feel scared because im not on the school trip so im not in a position to ask questions
8723,"<|emo_fear|> I'm really, really scared for y'all saying this."
8724,<|emo_fear|> i feel pretty terrified of how much i can damage him and not being able to do it
8725,<|emo_fear|> No problem. He could have a panic attack if he thinks he's going to get stuck in.
8726,<|emo_fear|> >I feel terrible about that Because apparently it happens so much that most people don’t even realize it’s happening
8727,"<|emo_fear|> Ahhhh the old ""what if we never got to see [NAME]"" thing. I love that one."
8728,"<|emo_fear|> Lol, same"
8729,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to open the case and attempt to get inside
8730,<|emo_fear|> She lost a great friend over this too. Very brave she must have thought the only way to fix this was to contact the police.
8731,<|emo_fear|> i think my sister could have done much worse than that she went into the water and almost went into shock
8732,<|emo_fear|> i do not feel nervous or anxious for whatever reason
8733,<|emo_fear|> i want to be completely clear that im feeling very indecisive
8734,<|emo_fear|> ive also had moments of feeling very nervous and unsure
8735,<|emo_fear|> Oh my [NAME] no.
8736,<|emo_fear|> im feeling insecure and jealous
8737,<|emo_fear|> She’s awful
8738,<|emo_fear|> i feel like a shy innocent child who is scared out there for his own safety
8739,"<|emo_fear|> I’m scared for y’all saying ""Assad must have weapons of mass destruction"" without evidence."
8740,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling nervous but somehow managed to keep my tone under control
8741,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a bit hesitant about making any more comments about it
8742,<|emo_fear|> The thing you worry about the most is a black eye.
8743,"<|emo_fear|> It's a very frightening feeling, to be afraid that you're about to fall into some awful fate"
8744,<|emo_fear|> This is so terrifying but true lol
8745,<|emo_fear|> i have been feeling pretty suspicious lately
8746,<|emo_fear|> i feel very skeptical at this point
8747,<|emo_fear|> This is really creepy.
8748,"<|emo_fear|> I can absolutely do that, and if that's the only thing she does, thank you for not objecting. "
8749,<|emo_fear|> The creepy eyes. Like if you ever go looking for a sign of her and just see the pupils. Very creepy.
8750,<|emo_fear|> i began to feel scared to see what lay ahead
8751,<|emo_fear|> i feel reluctant to let it go
8752,<|emo_fear|> I can’t believe she’s making light of this!!! Please tell me this is real life and this doesn’t pop right off
8753,<|emo_fear|> What a bummer. I’d love more trans visibility in games.
8754,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling very reluctant and hesitant but i m not going to lie
8755,<|emo_fear|> the way it sounds i'm terrified
8756,<|emo_fear|> i would feel a little fearful a lot more about this than i feel right now
8757,<|emo_fear|> If the concern is sexual risk then [RELIGION] is not for me.
8758,<|emo_fear|> im feeling hesitant and scared of everything
8759,<|emo_fear|> i get a feeling that this guy might be very confused
8760,"<|emo_fear|> He is, and I, honestly, am afraid."
8761,<|emo_fear|> i have a feeling that im about to get a weird taste in my mouth this christmas s hey at least i have some company
8762,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little unsure about how i feel about this one
8763,<|emo_fear|> i was left feeling doubtful and feeling helpless
8765,<|emo_fear|> This is scary to know that you went through. People like this are one step away from coming home with a gun or knife.
8766,<|emo_fear|> I'll have to check this out when i find more about those. I believe he was pressured by his parents into signing this
8767,<|emo_fear|> I find that the most terrifying.
8768,<|emo_fear|> i feel slightly paranoid
8769,<|emo_fear|> This is the scariest thing I think I’ve ever read on here!
8770,<|emo_fear|> This is so scary! I love you [NAME]! You are an amazing mommy and doctor! I have great respect for you doctor. ❤️
8771,<|emo_fear|> i feel very hesitantly optimistic
8772,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling very frightened and afraid as well
8773,<|emo_fear|> It can get pretty intense when two opposite ends meet
8774,<|emo_fear|> i feel paranoid i want to close my door and hide myself from this man
8775,<|emo_fear|> i feel apprehensive i fear for my safety
8776,<|emo_fear|> There's been a lot of talk recently about how [NAME] would be a terribleiller. This is what I said about him before.
8778,<|emo_fear|> I do think the big changes the government made in the pension age cut into everyone's retirement saving potential.
8780,<|emo_fear|> i feel afraid to write this because i feel like i could go either way before i make a final decision about this
8782,<|emo_fear|> i could tell it was feeling scared because all of the sounds were very faint
8783,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little weird
8784,<|emo_fear|> i would feel fearful that i will let out a horrible scream or scream out something horrible to someone
8785,<|emo_fear|> i feel strange when i feel uncertain or unsure about something
8786,<|emo_fear|> That was a terrible open shot....
8787,<|emo_fear|> i think i have been feeling somewhat apprehensive this morning
8788,<|emo_fear|> If he did say that you'd be right downvoted. I'd be really sad for him and his family.
8789,<|emo_fear|> There was also a terrible car accident on the way there.
8791,"<|emo_fear|> [NAME] was a surprise, but I liked his defense and confidence in the minutes we got him."
8792,<|emo_fear|> i feel more confused and sad than i did right before she passed away
8793,<|emo_fear|> i see the gentle crowding of the mass on the street it makes me feel scared and slightly anxious but it s still amazing
8794,<|emo_fear|> i dont think we are ever going to know what to make of any of this but i feel nervous and anxious and terrified
8795,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling paranoid and anxious thinking about what i was saying
8796,<|emo_fear|> i feel so helpless with this
8797,<|emo_fear|> i feel pretty scared already
8798,<|emo_fear|> im feeling nervous about it all i can think of is that as early as summer i was talking with a doctor about going to my local hairdresser to get a cut with some products
8799,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling really anxious and feeling very confused too and wondering how it happened
8800,<|emo_fear|> They’re all so scared
8801,"<|emo_fear|> I read that episode as ""10 years from now"" kinda sucks."
8803,<|emo_fear|> i started to feel very scared inside
8804,<|emo_fear|> And now you're worried about them remembering things.... okay. That's not a worry
8805,<|emo_fear|> The only scary thing about this is the face.
8806,<|emo_fear|> i feel more like i cant breathe and that is very uncomfortable and terrifying at the same time
8808,<|emo_fear|> i could feel the cold wind
8809,<|emo_fear|> i was feeling suspicious of other people and what we had on a plate
8810,<|emo_fear|> i feel kinda paranoid
8811,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] i know is a good actor i just feel extremely intimidated
8813,<|emo_fear|> i also feel extremely paranoid on a daily basis
8814,<|emo_fear|> i feel insecure by having a computer
8815,<|emo_fear|> That body is shockingly leaky.
8816,<|emo_fear|> My [NAME] I hate Twitter
8817,"<|emo_fear|> I thought it was so strange that the title of the video said “Vancouver”, I didn’t think I’d get any replies. "
8818,<|emo_fear|> He’s scared
8819,<|emo_fear|> i feel as if im being tortured by this nightmare
8821,<|emo_fear|> i remember feeling slightly uncomfortable feeling slightly doubtful that i should be the one to teach these children because i had never ever met one but now i felt no better
8822,<|emo_fear|> i feel pretty vulnerable in that
8823,<|emo_fear|> i woke up feeling very distressed on a sunday morning
8824,<|emo_fear|> i have spent more than two years feeling so terrified and confused but am now able to use my gifts to share them to others with a much greater capacity to understand
8825,<|emo_fear|> im feeling uncertain about something
8826,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little bit skeptical about that
8827,<|emo_fear|> That was definitely a missed opportunity. I was so angry to watch it but I really hope they stuck with it
8828,<|emo_fear|> I do believe she faked her own death. That is a horrible crime.
8830,"<|emo_fear|> Yeah, this last bit came out really horrible."
8831,<|emo_fear|> i feel terrified of them
8832,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling kind of nervous and anxious right now because i am so excited about this thing
8833,<|emo_fear|> i feel slightly shy in that respect but still i should mention im not old enough to have the parents i feel should be there just yet
8834,<|emo_fear|> i still do feel vulnerable
8836,<|emo_fear|> im feeling scared and nervous about it
8838,<|emo_fear|> i was starting to feel overwhelmed with my own attention and i was thinking about how much else there was in the world to do
8840,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] has one hell of a story to tell
8842,<|emo_fear|> i would feel doubtful
8843,<|emo_fear|> i did not feel intimidated
8846,"<|emo_fear|> I'm really confused. How do you put a number around 8-12 where 1 is ""not very scary"" and another 10 is ""frighteningly accurate""?"
8847,<|emo_fear|> That is awful. I wish I could be you because then that horrible part wouldnt exist.
8848,<|emo_fear|> It's probably something you should do to avoid getting scammed.
8849,<|emo_fear|> i feel more uncertain about life
8850,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] was horrible then. Now he's better. But this is still a horrible signing.
8851,<|emo_fear|> That’s horrible.
8852,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] never once mentionedian tucker. That scares me.
8853,<|emo_fear|> This poor sap
8854,<|emo_fear|> You can’t make a living from politics when the people most affected by it are the most cynical about the whole thing too.
8855,"<|emo_fear|> There is always the risk of them just blowing up but I think it's much more likely that she's bluffing, trusting them, not knowing anything."
8856,<|emo_fear|> i feel a bit hesitant to give anything of value away for fear everyone is going to be able to appreciate me
8857,<|emo_fear|> This is so terrifying. Eleven year old me is the same.
8858,<|emo_fear|> Well people are gonna go ahead and call it a hate crime if he actually threw a temper tantrum over that.
8859,"<|emo_fear|> I went to the bathroom yesterday, and I think I pooed a couple times! Do I have anxiety?"
8860,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little stressed up
8861,<|emo_fear|> i always feel a bit unsure and apprehensive about it all as it may or may not turn out
8863,<|emo_fear|> i am feeling fairly skeptical especially now
8864,<|emo_fear|> [NAME] is terrifying
8865,<|emo_fear|> im feeling quite apprehensive about being back
8866,<|emo_fear|> im feeling very apprehensive and nervous
8868,<|emo_fear|> The worst thing they could do is have her lie to an interviewer
8869,<|emo_fear|> im feeling a little bit shaky and hungry right now
8870,<|emo_fear|> i woke up feeling shaky and a little dazed
8871,<|emo_fear|> i feel really uncertain about things and i have no idea what's going on
8872,<|emo_fear|> i don t feel fearful but rather excited
8873,<|emo_fear|> I'm just scared they'll be able to land him after he signs a 5 year contract extension that will pays him over $80 million over the course of 5 years.
8874,<|emo_fear|> i feel more fearful than ever and scared of where i am and what i am doing
8875,<|emo_fear|> i cant help but feel a little paranoid
8876,<|emo_fear|> I was about to say that I was scared for her life!
8877,<|emo_fear|> i feel very paranoid very often
8878,<|emo_fear|> i do feel vulnerable but i feel no need to show it
8879,<|emo_fear|> im feeling quite uncertain
8880,<|emo_fear|> im just feeling very unsure and yet so very excited
8881,<|emo_fear|> Oh is that it? Have you tried overwheming it with some sachets of mayo? That's a nasty infection that'll probably get you eventually.

8887,<|emo_fear|> > It might not look bad I know a few people that did it but it was incredibly hauntering and made them feel like a weirdo.

8889,<|emo_fear|> im feeling hesitant about this
8890,<|emo_fear|> I'll kill you all
8891,<|emo_fear|> i feel a little weird saying this but i hope you understand

8906,"<|emo_fear|> I'm getting there. I'm terrified of saying that I'm tired, because it's just as bad as saying I'm short. "
8907,<|emo_fear|> You’re really gonna shock me tonight aren’t you?
8908,<|emo_fear|> i feel pretty shaken up
