0,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I'm a guy, but look at myself - it's still ugly despite having more makeup than he does!"""
1,<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest thing is they actually started to get subs back in January. That site was literally made by [NAME]
2,<|emo_disgust|> How disgusting the left is.
3,<|emo_disgust|> That’s disgusting. You can’t care for yourself. Shame.
4,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, that's deep."
5,<|emo_disgust|> That is NOT a fucking card?!
6,<|emo_disgust|> She’s hideous
7,<|emo_disgust|> It’s worse than I thought it would be! I’m so very sorry.
8,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking idiot lol
9,<|emo_disgust|> You're a horrible troll.
10,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst thing I've seen on reddit today.
11,<|emo_disgust|> This is the saddest thing I've seen today.
12,<|emo_disgust|> Well just get the point across we are all just idiots now
13,<|emo_disgust|> What a fuckin n
14,<|emo_disgust|> My condolences.
15,<|emo_disgust|> Worst case scenario is they're holding a high roll for a high roll in order to avoid taxes.
16,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fucking monster!
17,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow I’m hearing you, what is wrong with you!?"
18,<|emo_disgust|> Weird that the only job this guy does is complain about the amount of crap the system throws out.
19,<|emo_disgust|> Because our democracy is not going to be held hostage by terrorists
20,<|emo_disgust|> I hate Twitter
21,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is an absolute chad
22,"<|emo_disgust|> I hated reading the back issues, they never got on and there is still only 1 volume."
23,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is scary
24,<|emo_disgust|> That's just insane.
25,"<|emo_disgust|> He did say that he doesn’t agree with all of my political views, so I don’t actually see why I have to put any blame on him."
26,<|emo_disgust|> That face even has theSAME expression as [NAME] did back in the day!!
27,<|emo_disgust|> He’s a big dumb wretch
28,<|emo_disgust|> You've become that much more disturbing in the wake of these horrific attacks.
29,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you bring facts into this conversation! /s
30,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah it's kinda weird. I feel for her though.
31,<|emo_disgust|> Worst news for now though. The team is expected to field the worst in the NFC NORTH this year.
32,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking n
33,"<|emo_disgust|> The last line ""of"" is curious... Sounds like you're talking about the ""theaters"" but I think they're more for nonliterary audiences."
34,<|emo_disgust|> i hate myself for finding the last post but i feel like i ve missed out on some of the best posts
35,<|emo_disgust|> That’s disgusting. The worst thing [NAME] saying in this video is “I’m here because I didn’t like her up until “45” seconds into the video..”
36,<|emo_disgust|> Weird but effective.
37,<|emo_disgust|> This is me all the time. I can’t stand it.
38,"<|emo_disgust|> I think you can agree with a lot of the posts, but hate the comments...."
39,<|emo_disgust|> When they did that [NAME] and [NAME] poster they’re just making you think that he would probably just walk away from the deal. Not that the situation is the one he is dealing.
40,<|emo_disgust|> You shut your mouth because you're scared
41,<|emo_disgust|> Not at all! I’m sorry for your loss. I will pray for you and our other friend in need in this thread!
42,<|emo_disgust|> This is really creepy. Good riddance to awful rubbish.
43,<|emo_disgust|> Wow you’re just a faggot who wants to see the world's most violent gangster shoot a human being in the face.
44,<|emo_disgust|> This is horrible... OP is good at his job he should be ashamed of himself
45,"<|emo_disgust|> No, but I'm already disgusted by Chicago."
46,"<|emo_disgust|> I hate that I like them, it's so annoying."
47,<|emo_disgust|> >[NAME] is being punished for having opposed the war effort. This is insane.
48,<|emo_disgust|> You're just a disgusting example of a human being.
49,<|emo_disgust|> This is horrible
50,<|emo_disgust|> This is weird.
51,<|emo_disgust|> Worst radio ever.
52,<|emo_disgust|> This is kinda creepy.
53,"<|emo_disgust|> But they are actually worse than the old days, remember back when the police only showed up in force when there was a warrant out?"
54,"<|emo_disgust|> If it's such a problem, consider moving. Some cities are just too damn expensive."
55,<|emo_disgust|> Why would you say that? That’s weird.
56,<|emo_disgust|> She’s such a piece of shit
57,<|emo_disgust|> This makes me want to die
58,<|emo_disgust|> My feelings aren't hurt
59,<|emo_disgust|> What a disgusting woman
60,<|emo_disgust|> I hate when I get high and remember just one thing but now I remember more
61,<|emo_disgust|> I'm just mad the government shut down and said they'll provide money to keep it running.
62,"<|emo_disgust|> If a gun shop owner opens up about doing this stuff, he'll lose his license and possibly everything in his shop next window"
63,<|emo_disgust|> You’re a sick take
64,<|emo_disgust|> This is creepy.
65,<|emo_disgust|> Man I would like to see a picture of [NAME] doing the YT cringe.
66,<|emo_disgust|> My life is complete
67,"<|emo_disgust|> The best was a friend catching me cheating, calling me a names and saying he didn't respect me anymore. I was barely out of high school honestly"
68,<|emo_disgust|> The most awful thing that can possibly happen to someone's health is them not having any of their teeth fixed.
69,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] here - we also blame [NAME] and [NAME] for being involved in the original scam
70,<|emo_disgust|> It's so horrifying that in 2017 even big corporations are willing to pay their workers $15 an hour.
71,"<|emo_disgust|> They’re angry, but not because [NAME] doesn’t deserve blame. We all are."
72,<|emo_disgust|> Weird flex.
73,<|emo_disgust|> And it sucks because it's true
74,"<|emo_disgust|> When it comes to food the worst is still reserved for prepared meals by trusted people, and often times those same people charge you extra for tableware they say isn't made of metal."
75,<|emo_disgust|> And it doesn’t seem to help. And it’s really stupid.. everyone’s sitting around and then saying “I’m sorry but you’re right!”
76,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit. No way I thought she was the same person.
77,<|emo_disgust|> The sad part is he wasn’t even on the field at all
78,"<|emo_disgust|> I was like ""oh yeah"". ""Errr."""
79,<|emo_disgust|> You literally cannot expect an intelligent person to take seriously such a ridiculous claim.
80,<|emo_disgust|> i think my mom is feeling a bit bitchy about life
81,<|emo_disgust|> Those poor children. What a tragedy.
82,"<|emo_disgust|> This was so dumb, disgusting and sad. Now I feel bad for the workers. "
83,<|emo_disgust|> When will be [NAME] and [NAME] in the same team...
84,<|emo_disgust|> This is a perfect example of how having too much power and having enough influence does nothing but set the stage for many more messianic cults.
85,<|emo_disgust|> The fact you are still here makes me want to die
86,<|emo_disgust|> i feel really petty and selfish
87,<|emo_disgust|> This guy actually seemed pretty angry the whole time.
88,<|emo_disgust|> Thats beyond fucking creepy.
89,<|emo_disgust|> And here I thought we were talking about breast Implying there is a difference between breasts and hair.
90,<|emo_disgust|> Weird way to spell cow
91,"<|emo_disgust|> You don't give him money even if he requests it, you're a greedy piece of shit."
92,<|emo_disgust|> I got bit by a Wasilla husky once. It was so bad I had a bloody gash on my cheek.
93,"<|emo_disgust|> I actually kinda like the new generation ofombas. The grunts are a little cringe but they're stillombas, and if shaken they're fleshy maw-humans!"
94,"<|emo_disgust|> When my wife had a baby, I was like, 'I don't think I'm having a kid until next month' "
95,<|emo_disgust|> This is so dumb.
96,<|emo_disgust|> If this is not news then what the fuck is it.
97,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]? Not surprised I know him, I just had him for nthcore album"
98,"<|emo_disgust|> What in the overall fuck? He was on this sub yesterday, didn't he? I mean it's weird."
99,<|emo_disgust|> I am [RELIGION] non-believing for the sake of being non-believing.
101,<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell has reddit in the top 5 worst websites out there?
102,"<|emo_disgust|> It’s hard to not get frustrated with people who aren’t familiar with the system, they lack responsibility and are being stupid "
103,"<|emo_disgust|> No she didn't, she's the one who's awful."
104,<|emo_disgust|> That is awful. :(
105,<|emo_disgust|> That is wild. Is there any regulation against using them? I'd be shocked.
106,<|emo_disgust|> I’m disgusted that we don’t see an improvement in our save percentage during this homestretch compared to last year.
107,<|emo_disgust|> So many lies and halftruths from you. Stop lying.
108,<|emo_disgust|> She reminds me of Ginger from Ginger Snaps! I absolutely love Ginger Snaps but this girl just reminds me of Ginger from Ginger Snaps!
110,"<|emo_disgust|> You are disgusting. I hope your wife finds Somebody much, much better than you."
111,"<|emo_disgust|> You should definitely check out [NAME] album, his voice is phenomenal"
112,<|emo_disgust|> Holy heckin heck
113,"<|emo_disgust|> So there you have it, he's lying about it being 3am. "
114,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a moron.
115,<|emo_disgust|> We just got fired yesterday for not keeping our head above water. It's just a miserable situation.
116,<|emo_disgust|> >The thing to understand is that the subreddit is now a hivemind ofrats pissed at the country.
117,<|emo_disgust|> And the weirdest part is he also has a history of injuries...
118,<|emo_disgust|> The best way is to ask questions in an open and honest manner. If you are reluctant to do anything as is then there's no need to get angry.
119,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is just to have a boyfriend. That dude would probably only call you a nb if you called him a nb
120,"<|emo_disgust|> This is worse than the [NAME] situation, but yes, yes, this is creepy. "
121,<|emo_disgust|> So glad [NAME] fired him. So sad he's not coming back.
122,<|emo_disgust|> That's the worst possible outcome
123,<|emo_disgust|> He’s creepy
124,<|emo_disgust|> What a crazy thing to be upset about.
125,<|emo_disgust|> I have no idea why they gave her a shirt. She's so pretty and it would probably shock nobody who gets to wear it.
126,<|emo_disgust|> The absolute worst!!!
127,<|emo_disgust|> A lot has changed since my childhood
128,<|emo_disgust|> i feel jealous and i want people like you to like me
129,"<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst meme format in the history of meme formats, maybe ever"
130,"<|emo_disgust|> How dare you - you are the one who is awful, I'm disgusted to see you use such a similar argument to someone who is less fortunate! "
131,<|emo_disgust|> I just hope he brings at least one good thing to the table. I wouldn't be too hard on him if he does.
132,<|emo_disgust|> i will feel pissed off about nothing
133,<|emo_disgust|> Thats pretty lewd. Im glad you decided to report him. A good reporting man has a lot more at stake than a celebrity's celebrity status.
134,<|emo_disgust|> Lol you're a mean person.
135,<|emo_disgust|> i can make an old man feel shamed
136,<|emo_disgust|> She sounds hideous.
137,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I’d love to go there!
138,"<|emo_disgust|> This is stupid, I've seen this 3 different times."
139,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn it, I’ve felt worse for [NAME] than [NAME] while eating out"
140,<|emo_disgust|> You shouldnt be ashamed of being able to pick your nose.
141,<|emo_disgust|> This post is bad because the only good phone is the Palm Pre 3 running webOS
142,<|emo_disgust|> This is so cringy. Good riddance to awful rubbish.
143,"<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I'm normally a big supporter of his, but this is just... awful."
144,<|emo_disgust|> I've seen it before with bad results.
145,<|emo_disgust|> The real scary part is getting that stupid tattoo.
146,<|emo_disgust|> So.... you are a weirdo.
147,<|emo_disgust|> My son told me to get out
148,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] I HATE these
149,"<|emo_disgust|> He also wrote ""the world will end when I show up at a bank in my pajamas"""
150,<|emo_disgust|> You’re disgusting
151,"<|emo_disgust|> When my ex and I separated, she wouldn’t come out of our home for two weeks."
152,"<|emo_disgust|> It is weird that this is seen as ""hurtful"" because it is true."
153,<|emo_disgust|> The world is now a cruel place...
154,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is such a fucking dino
155,"<|emo_disgust|> People's rights are being taken away from them, what else are you on about."
156,<|emo_disgust|> I wonder if the girl I had feelings for would have rejected me if I did this way.
157,"<|emo_disgust|> Because they think the same way [NAME] does. It's sad, but people on here just don't seem to understand the real world."
158,<|emo_disgust|> So fucking selfish of [NAME] to actually believe that. Reminds me of my [NAME] story
159,<|emo_disgust|> It’s really weird how positive my life has become in just 8 months
160,"<|emo_disgust|> So you literally believe you're worse than [NAME] is? Wow, you sure aren't subtle. "
161,<|emo_disgust|> Oh look another shit call
162,<|emo_disgust|> That's ridiculous. Can't believe they were so desperate to find a [NAME] comparison.
163,<|emo_disgust|> I don’t understand the point you’re making.
165,<|emo_disgust|> Why are these assholes Facebook friends?
166,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. [NAME] would probably be more offended.
167,<|emo_disgust|> What a terrible list
168,"<|emo_disgust|> Lol you're a stupidass for calling it a joke and calling it a ""fuck"" then? You're an idiot!"
169,<|emo_disgust|> You're an awful human being.
170,<|emo_disgust|> This may be your worst fear. Something terrible is going to happen if you let it. Do not listen to [NAME].
171,<|emo_disgust|> Damn straight.
172,<|emo_disgust|> I miss [NAME]!
173,<|emo_disgust|> I love that this is written on notebook paper
174,<|emo_disgust|> It’s just about the last thing I want to see on my website.....
175,<|emo_disgust|> A fucking centaur
176,"<|emo_disgust|> You're an awful human being, and an even worse president."
177,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that she's even considering this sort of thing is pretty damn disturbing to be honest.
178,<|emo_disgust|> No way! People are being too hard on [NAME] when he actually sucks!
179,<|emo_disgust|> Those are the worst ears I've ever heard...so are those wet behindears!
180,<|emo_disgust|> People on this sub are so desperate they'll defend anyone who supports a 2nd referendum. Fuck off.
181,<|emo_disgust|> The one in my living room. Stupid science damn it!
182,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck shit bitch
183,"<|emo_disgust|> I get abused for saying that there are racist morons in this sub, which is a weirdly specific definition of being ""moron"". "
184,"<|emo_disgust|> Well you had the worst of the worst, but still you posted it. Congratulations bravely."
185,<|emo_disgust|> It’s a very obvious case of his doing what he wants to do with his life.
186,"<|emo_disgust|> What? No deal, abort, abort. It could go worse than abort, abort."
187,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like a greedy naughty child
188,<|emo_disgust|> Sooooo bad its hilarious.
189,"<|emo_disgust|> This is what it's come to. I hated the first one so much, it made me want to die"
191,<|emo_disgust|> He got fired because his performance was so terrible in the regular season. You fired him bc of performance and you are honestly a horrible person.
192,<|emo_disgust|> i woke up feeling absolutely terrified of what was about to happen
193,"<|emo_disgust|> Shut up, [NAME]. "
194,<|emo_disgust|> That was horrible defending what the hell
195,<|emo_disgust|> That would be a horrifically bad kick.
196,<|emo_disgust|> That seems rude.
198,<|emo_disgust|> She's a disgrace to the species
199,<|emo_disgust|> The way he just starts kicking the guy while holding the 2 Ak's is sick.
200,<|emo_disgust|> I'm so fucking heartless my little abomination doesn't deserve the same fate as [NAME].
201,<|emo_disgust|> It’s racist.
202,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds awful. I'm sorry you never had a chance to realize your dreams.
203,<|emo_disgust|> You can get your socks changed but no matter what you do you're still a girl?
205,<|emo_disgust|> You should have asked for a ride home and they wouldn't let you in. You're selfish for saying something like that.
206,<|emo_disgust|> I don't think the average [NAME] fan really likes him that much.
207,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] what the actual fuck? What do you do? Is he an actor or a teacher? You don't really have any experience aside from singing at a bar and that actually looks alright.
208,<|emo_disgust|> You are disgusting
209,<|emo_disgust|> i thought it was a bit odd that i felt the need to apologise to my parents
210,<|emo_disgust|> This is the dumbest post I've read today
211,<|emo_disgust|> It's no wonder then he's the worst pure forward in the league.
212,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck off.
213,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds awful. What do you learn in there? What advice does that leave you with?
214,<|emo_disgust|> I'm just mad at the amount of bullshit said about [NAME] on here.
215,<|emo_disgust|> I want to die
216,<|emo_disgust|> Man that’s a horrible take.
218,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, he dead"
219,<|emo_disgust|> Why would you say that now that your mother is back?
220,<|emo_disgust|> Those damn tires
221,<|emo_disgust|> This is a terrible idea
222,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] that's my favorite
223,<|emo_disgust|> It's the worst feeling ever
224,<|emo_disgust|> I'm getting a weird vibe from all the positive replies.
225,<|emo_disgust|> What a weird thing to say.
226,<|emo_disgust|> Now this I can’t stand
227,"<|emo_disgust|> It's hard to see, he has the biggest mouthing habits I've ever heard of"
228,"<|emo_disgust|> She is so ugly and shapely, what a shame that film got her that way."
229,"<|emo_disgust|> If he had the chance to be president, he'd probably do worse than [NAME], but that's just my educated guess."
230,<|emo_disgust|> The most disgusting thing I've seen on this subreddit in a long time.
231,<|emo_disgust|> Soooo [NAME] is getting ready to have sex wtf with that photo
232,"<|emo_disgust|> It was so weird to me because I've never heard of this before. I'm a fairly big eater, so likely it's just my morbid curiosity. "
233,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking bozo
234,<|emo_disgust|> i feel quite envious of him
235,<|emo_disgust|> The most dangerous game in the world. One that even the most experienced players can't prepare for.
236,"<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriatingly clear, so totally slapdash. Just wow. #YIFEDOWN"
238,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] I hate Twitter
239,<|emo_disgust|> This is horrifying
240,<|emo_disgust|> It’s not very hard to find decent [NAME] pictures!
241,<|emo_disgust|> What a weird way to put it
242,<|emo_disgust|> >the movie sucks because the lead wasn't the asshole you think he is.
243,<|emo_disgust|> I've been abused enough by my own government to be scared to speak my mind.
244,<|emo_disgust|> The amount of bullshit [NAME] gets daily on his radio show is absolutely disgusting.
245,"<|emo_disgust|> I’m with you, food porn is awful and no one wants to be the one to share it with others. "
246,<|emo_disgust|> I'm so jealous.
247,<|emo_disgust|> It's a fucking pothole.
248,"<|emo_disgust|> Don't go thinking ""us vs them"""
249,<|emo_disgust|> You can hate people for liking your Facebook post.
250,<|emo_disgust|> Weird but effective
251,<|emo_disgust|> Well the dude is a bit drunk tonight.
252,<|emo_disgust|> i got to the bar and sat there until about half past two when the bartender came and started talking to the crowd feeling a lil bit annoyed with me
253,<|emo_disgust|> I have a horrible feeling about this one
254,<|emo_disgust|> I fucking hate New Years day by ourselves.
255,<|emo_disgust|> Damn is it really?!
256,<|emo_disgust|> Well if he doesn't like you then that's a problem... :/
257,"<|emo_disgust|> The last few times I have watched it, I have found [NAME] to be quite obnoxious. "
258,<|emo_disgust|> Oh look at that
259,<|emo_disgust|> Why do you hate yourself?
260,<|emo_disgust|> A very passive aggressive way to say you never want to hurt her feelings
261,<|emo_disgust|> I can feel bad for him but [NAME] would be devastated and wouldn't be good at either.
262,<|emo_disgust|> The more you think about it the more it seems awful.
263,"<|emo_disgust|> Sooooo, are those in states you don't care about?"
264,"<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit, she went off on dad and all, and this is what she said? "
265,<|emo_disgust|> Because [NAME] has said and done nothing illegal. He should get off the street.
266,<|emo_disgust|> What an awful list
267,<|emo_disgust|> What a weird situation
268,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I’m sorry dude. I know it’s not your fault, it’s your friend. No blame to you because she didn’t actually say *no shit* lol."
269,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm so sad for you, this story is so damn heartwarming. 💕"
270,<|emo_disgust|> i feel offended by the fact that a simple word makes him feel as though his words are worthless
271,<|emo_disgust|> That’s so brutal. So disgusting.
272,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, the number of Redditors who hate [NAME] is pretty astounding. "
273,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting. WTF are you on about now?
274,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't have insurance and only have my wife's insurance. I'm on paid for, and so far, the results have been mixed."
275,<|emo_disgust|> i just feel more violent and obnoxious
276,"<|emo_disgust|> This is awful advice, and it's not even bad advice. It's disgusting."
277,<|emo_disgust|> What a horrible list
278,<|emo_disgust|> Holy FUCK...
279,<|emo_disgust|> i was feeling very anxious because i had not yet gotten any news from anyone about anything
280,<|emo_disgust|> I have. It's terrible.
281,<|emo_disgust|> He looks like a bear....
282,<|emo_disgust|> i feel less insulted with a few words about a stranger
283,<|emo_disgust|> Lol y'all are so fucking privileged
285,<|emo_disgust|> The [NAME] of horror.
286,<|emo_disgust|> This one is my favorite.
288,<|emo_disgust|> That [NAME] part killed me!
289,<|emo_disgust|> Damn this is dope
290,<|emo_disgust|> No kidding. Fuck off with your bullshit argument.
291,<|emo_disgust|> Now this I like.
292,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is waiting 6 months to get fired. Sounds ridiculous to me.
293,"<|emo_disgust|> That was worse than a movie jump scare. I can't imagine doing that, but I'd love to one day. "
294,<|emo_disgust|> It's creepy.
295,<|emo_disgust|> i dont think i had a single drop of oil on me the entire day
296,"<|emo_disgust|> You're being an awful, awful person."
298,<|emo_disgust|> A whole lot of people in my thread believe it. Which is weird because I'm normally a fairly calm and rational person.
299,<|emo_disgust|> Oh no! Your poor man.
300,<|emo_disgust|> This looks like total garbage.
301,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit that's bad
302,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting omg
303,<|emo_disgust|> You have to be a very stupid person to use Facebook with kids. And now I get the same message. What a idiot.
304,<|emo_disgust|> So fucking heart warming. Brother love man it’s wholesome as shit.
305,<|emo_disgust|> Just stop.
306,<|emo_disgust|> I'm pretty sure it was the head; it just squealed like a dog when it hit.
307,<|emo_disgust|> There's a difference between being racist and using the n-word.
308,<|emo_disgust|> You're a horrible human being.
309,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird, I was thinking like this on Twitter too..."
310,<|emo_disgust|> This actually sounds like cyberbullying and it’s a terrible thing to be doing. I’m so sorry you’re dealing with it.
311,<|emo_disgust|> That's worse. Imagine being this stupid
312,<|emo_disgust|> Oh wow more like shitttttt
313,<|emo_disgust|> Wow. Now that's just... Wow.
315,<|emo_disgust|> > And yet more hate for the 1% What a fucking load of old shite.
316,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird flex, but ok"
317,<|emo_disgust|> The main thing I'd change is the ending. If you think OP's account is still better than mine I'd say fuck off and start fresh.
318,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] fucking dammit
319,<|emo_disgust|> I just want to die
320,<|emo_disgust|> So much hate.
321,<|emo_disgust|> This sounds like complete spacy. I can't imagine a scenario in which you are an [NAME] and not a spacy.
322,<|emo_disgust|> I want to break my phone in half
323,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, those dreadful things. I gave those away."
324,<|emo_disgust|> You're a baddy if you post stuff like this
325,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, she probably had a bad experience with at least one person, you should really be more worried about that. "
326,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like im being heckled all the time on this blog so im glad you liked it just slightly
327,<|emo_disgust|> My wife's birthday is in May and she gave me a surprise birthday party the other week. She was really upset that I got to attend but I appreciate it.
328,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is hurting us right now
329,<|emo_disgust|> And that wig is awful
330,<|emo_disgust|> Man I hate how much I love this one.
331,<|emo_disgust|> I hate everything about this
332,<|emo_disgust|> This is fucking disgusting
333,<|emo_disgust|> It is rather scary seeing such a child in this state. I'm heartbroken for you.
334,<|emo_disgust|> Why are you such a terrible person lol
335,<|emo_disgust|> It looks like a poorly printed T-shirt.
336,<|emo_disgust|> This is ugly af sry
337,<|emo_disgust|> Oh she dead
338,<|emo_disgust|> i could feel myself become extremely agitated but all i did was pick up the phone and call the police
339,<|emo_disgust|> That's weird as well. I didn't know you wrote.
340,<|emo_disgust|> i get a feeling that i would be extremely frustrating if i got my hands on a canasta de chinchilla
341,<|emo_disgust|> And you're not a horrible person for saying that. You're just saying that because you don't like it.
342,<|emo_disgust|> That’s disgusting
343,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird, people only liked [NAME] after he was arrested for assault."
344,<|emo_disgust|> I hate how much I love it
345,"<|emo_disgust|> It was an absolute lie. He never said he was ""flirting"" with you. He said he got distracted and was too busy looking at the girl to get a reaction."
347,<|emo_disgust|> Shut your mouth
348,<|emo_disgust|> Why? Because it's funnier.
350,<|emo_disgust|> I just have a deep seeded hatred for close-minded people too.
351,<|emo_disgust|> How dare she put your baby on a fucking Tracer mask
352,<|emo_disgust|> Why the fuck do we play the Sabres anymore? Fuck [NAME]
353,<|emo_disgust|> i think that is a pretty fair amount. if it didnt be this obnoxious it may be worse.
354,<|emo_disgust|> This made my day. Ha well at least it got the attention they deserve. Those guys need their lives back.
355,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds dreadful.
356,<|emo_disgust|> Oh god another injury
357,<|emo_disgust|> And what a dog it was to breed her...
358,<|emo_disgust|> Oh you're being bullied... You're being wronged. You have every right to be angry.
359,<|emo_disgust|> There's no way around it!
360,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] that's horrible. I hope nothing like that happens to you.
361,<|emo_disgust|> i feel very very greedy here i am
362,<|emo_disgust|> I hate that I like her...
363,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst thing I've seen on Reddit. Take my upvote.
364,<|emo_disgust|> Just a dumbass lol
365,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a moron, how dare you."
366,"<|emo_disgust|> There isn't always a right time. Just the worst. And when there isn't always a right time a lot of times, a much worse."
368,<|emo_disgust|> She was running with a fake outfit on and it looked pretty awful.
369,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst I've ever seen 👌
370,<|emo_disgust|> This is the weirdest thing I've ever seen on this sub....
372,<|emo_disgust|> You're disgusting
373,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah no more drinking fudge. This country is a shame.
374,<|emo_disgust|> Not really cringe. Just sad human behavior.
376,<|emo_disgust|> That was worse than a movie jump scare. I literally screamed out loud in terror as that figure justrolled past
377,<|emo_disgust|> Who is bored? Why do we act surprised? He's probably sleeping.
378,<|emo_disgust|> That is child abuse. No decent parent would force their kid to starve just because they don’t understand science and nutrition
379,<|emo_disgust|> People need to stop excusing bad behavior
380,<|emo_disgust|> She was disgusting
381,"<|emo_disgust|> How dare you say that about us, [NAME]!"
382,<|emo_disgust|> That is just absolutely disgusting. Apt.
383,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], you have a lot to learn about the power of prayer, [NAME]!"
384,<|emo_disgust|> This is the fucking worst I've ever seen.
385,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, you made my day. "
386,<|emo_disgust|> He is creepy
387,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like he has a weird way of letting other people into his head
388,"<|emo_disgust|> If he's this bad next year, expect the worst and hope for the best."
389,<|emo_disgust|> Because its creepy and weird
390,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah dude his dad is a fucking psychopath
391,<|emo_disgust|> I don't believe his story at all.
392,"<|emo_disgust|> i did feel like we were being an impatient lot of the time because i would come in often feel frustrated and then think ""oh well maybe next time"""
393,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, I really hate that [NAME] is a [NAME] mouth piece. "
394,<|emo_disgust|> The poor car.
395,<|emo_disgust|> How the fuck do I post?
396,<|emo_disgust|> A week after a fat DnD kid called him a piece of shit...
397,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, that's awful. I'm glad you're doing better."
398,"<|emo_disgust|> The worst is working for hire, where the company is owned by a previous company."
399,<|emo_disgust|> Weird flex but ok
400,<|emo_disgust|> I would get very violent and sick while doing this
401,<|emo_disgust|> I see you used car lots all over this crap..
402,<|emo_disgust|> That's a lousy upper body shot.
403,<|emo_disgust|> The biggest Nightmare
404,<|emo_disgust|> My boyfriend doesn't like hearing about these sorts of things because he's used to these sort of situations. He's a very laid back person who's always been like that with me.
405,<|emo_disgust|> It's almost weird that the only change in a card's art is that artist's name!
406,<|emo_disgust|> I have a very sensitive stomach but am also very happy that I don't have any issues with colorectal cancer or anything of the sort.
408,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn that's a good one. ""We're just having a good day and all we can think is we fucked up last night."" Hilariously correct."
409,<|emo_disgust|> This is not a picture of [NAME]. This is a picture of a puppy being run over by a car
410,<|emo_disgust|> My bad I meant to say [NAME]?
411,<|emo_disgust|> Oh wow I thought this was a blog about veganism!!
412,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] i fucking hate that
413,"<|emo_disgust|> It's creepy and weird to think that you'd want me over that much, I'm only 21. "
414,<|emo_disgust|> i think it was so much more of rage and revenge on her behalf but i havent given up on feeling hurt
415,"<|emo_disgust|> If not the worst, then at least it is quite awful."
416,"<|emo_disgust|> If the car doors get stuck open, it's a horrible time."
417,<|emo_disgust|> My parents are going to kill me when they find out.
418,"<|emo_disgust|> I know, I know.ing sucks, worst feeling ever"
419,<|emo_disgust|> Damn it.
420,<|emo_disgust|> This is so creepy. Good riddance to awful rubbish.
421,<|emo_disgust|> They have an awful lot of fake fans on there. I can't imagine being able to find a good fan for a fake game.
422,<|emo_disgust|> That video is garbage
423,"<|emo_disgust|> But the issue is, the US has more money and guns than any other country. /s"
424,<|emo_disgust|> I hate reddit.
425,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] made the Worst team ever. Why don't we start with him?
426,"<|emo_disgust|> I’m saying he’s a weirdo, and he’s weird. That’s the problem with him "
427,<|emo_disgust|> She’s going to hate you for life
428,<|emo_disgust|> It's the worst. Where you can see the stumps and hear the trucks.
429,<|emo_disgust|> So there it is. My money is on neither
430,<|emo_disgust|> That's just horrible.
431,"<|emo_disgust|> How about changing the name of your company to ""Fuck Your Face"""
432,<|emo_disgust|> He is a moron.
433,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking cunt
434,<|emo_disgust|> Because people are idiots and will say or do anything to win a fight.
435,<|emo_disgust|> People are very complicated.
437,<|emo_disgust|> They actually do give away their phones. This is the worst part of the whole deal.
438,"<|emo_disgust|> But, then again, it’s not that I hated them, it was that I’d rather them just do it. "
439,<|emo_disgust|> Shut up [NAME] you shill /s
440,<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest part is the hair
443,"<|emo_disgust|> And yes, I'm in Canada. Sorry, I've never heard of this before."
444,<|emo_disgust|> People also had their pictures taken with what appear to.
445,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like it s rude that i dont feel less petty
446,<|emo_disgust|> The only compliment I could give this is that it’s from someone who’s never had anything good to say about [NAME]
447,"<|emo_disgust|> So yes, I hate him. "
448,"<|emo_disgust|> This is one in a series I've been posting lately about the perils of ""policing by statistics""."
449,"<|emo_disgust|> There's been some terrific reaction from our fans and you're right, our schedule doesn't take kindly to injury. Just remember we are playing the Leafs at home for a whole week."
450,<|emo_disgust|> This is so creepy and sad. Good riddance to awful rubbish.
451,<|emo_disgust|> He was horrible
452,<|emo_disgust|> You can't judge us on our food. There is always a high concentration of rice and corn in our homes.
454,<|emo_disgust|> She looks like she's trying to pull a [NAME]
455,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], [NAME] are worst."
456,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, [NAME] has been weird lately, I’d be shocked if he wasn’t trying to hide it. "
457,<|emo_disgust|> Because people hate freedom
458,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah. He's so much worse than [NAME] when it comes to handling pressure.
459,<|emo_disgust|> This is awful.
460,<|emo_disgust|> That’s horrible. I love it
461,<|emo_disgust|> That's just...ghastly.
463,"<|emo_disgust|> I'd like to say this is my favorite scene in the movie but damn, that guy's face looks damn awful."
464,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst thing I've seen so far this year
465,<|emo_disgust|> So cringy and desperate
466,"<|emo_disgust|> What was that really??? I was too dumb to even do that haha, remember that episode?"
467,<|emo_disgust|> I’m a little mouthy guy but at least [NAME] doesn’t mind getting his dirty boots on.
469,<|emo_disgust|> He's a weirdo
470,<|emo_disgust|> Well fuck them for their own safety.
472,<|emo_disgust|> i feel selfish for feeling so much the opposite
473,<|emo_disgust|> Damn you are autistic
474,<|emo_disgust|> It's kinda rude.
475,"<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest thing about this comment is how much I agree with it. I think it's absolutely vital to keeping certain spaces civil, including the internet."
476,<|emo_disgust|> It’s still disgusting.
477,<|emo_disgust|> That's weird. Are you talking about the [NAME] in the background or [NAME]?
478,<|emo_disgust|> I think it's pretty safe to say they're just jealous of your awesome dog.
479,<|emo_disgust|> This sub is why I have no respect for reddit.
480,<|emo_disgust|> How do you know I didn't already say something negative about her... >it doesn't matter >its her game.
481,<|emo_disgust|> I'm pretty disgusted and hate him for life
482,<|emo_disgust|> Those people need to be sent to a mental hospital
483,<|emo_disgust|> You beat me to it.
484,<|emo_disgust|> The real bad cold is the combination of a fever and sore throat. Most people are fine with either but if you're sick you probably want to avoid both
485,<|emo_disgust|> I don’t think [NAME] should head coaching the Seahawks. That’s pretty much the worst job he could ever imagine.
487,<|emo_disgust|> A week ago I would of taken that bet. Still regretting it lol.
488,<|emo_disgust|> The reason I'm not surprised is the recent revelation that he's trying to distance himself from [NAME] over his relationship with his mother.
489,<|emo_disgust|> If you’re feeling too salty for your burgers tonight just order takeout. You have that look already.
490,<|emo_disgust|> You can't be more selfish and selfish doesn't even mean you're less evil. You're just a more selfish person because you're an evil one
491,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is working with dealerships
492,<|emo_disgust|> The [NAME] was getting ready to get the f**ked out of there for that last stand
493,"<|emo_disgust|> Not that I'm a fan, but I really would be very interested in some of these issues."
494,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is trash.
495,<|emo_disgust|> So disgusting. First Im sorry for your loss. Im living proof we can do better.
496,"<|emo_disgust|> Not to be negative, but [NAME] is awful (by the standards of /r/45minutes)"
497,<|emo_disgust|> It’s really disgusting that you think that.
498,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a berk.
499,<|emo_disgust|> How dare they! Their entire team is the same!
500,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I want to see that damn short horror. [NAME] damn it.
501,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck the rangers
502,<|emo_disgust|> She is a horrible person with an awful track record.
503,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] isn’t interested in winning....
504,<|emo_disgust|> i feel cold
505,<|emo_disgust|> What a disgusting list
506,<|emo_disgust|> Weird.
507,"<|emo_disgust|> So you just admit you're a loner, asshole and jealous? That's pretty low in my esteem."
509,<|emo_disgust|> If I didn't want my child to be vaccinated I would've never had any. Absolutely brutal.
510,<|emo_disgust|> I don't think either is a scam but their offering is stupid.
511,<|emo_disgust|> Worst is life but as much as i loved my time at sea i honestly wish it had lasted another month
512,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] isn't a politician because he is a psychopath. He is a politician because he believes power is the best revenge.
513,<|emo_disgust|> That was worse than a movie jump scare
514,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] i am sooo angry
515,<|emo_disgust|> You're ugly
516,<|emo_disgust|> That's the most optimistic possible outcome for this situation. I dont think it's healthy for the player to let his ego cloud his ability for the team in the long run
517,<|emo_disgust|> It's actually weird that most of these are women.
518,<|emo_disgust|> Worst feeling ever
519,<|emo_disgust|> But it’s so...ridiculous. Like it’s reality TV.
520,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fucking hoe in this movie
521,"<|emo_disgust|> No. That’s sad, [NAME] should be embarrassed. "
522,<|emo_disgust|> Oh no!
523,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry, but your parents had much better taste..."
524,<|emo_disgust|> Just because they were a little girl doesn't mean they're grown up.
525,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking nsfw game
526,<|emo_disgust|> Shut up [NAME] is now playing [NAME] like it was the 10th man back in college.
527,<|emo_disgust|> That sub is a hate sub.
528,"<|emo_disgust|> He was just fucking out there getting it done, dude. needs to be made a thing instead of this cringe"
529,<|emo_disgust|> It can get dark and cold here at night.
530,<|emo_disgust|> Because it's creepy and weird.
531,<|emo_disgust|> That’s disgusting. You should be ashamed for spreading that kind of wisdom.
532,<|emo_disgust|> I miss the west.
533,<|emo_disgust|> People are so insane.
534,<|emo_disgust|> Well you cant beat the heat from a wood fire as it never gets dark out.
535,"<|emo_disgust|> You'd think she was one of the 40%+ white, male heads of state in the world, but apparently she isn't. "
536,"<|emo_disgust|> I am not disgusted by it, much more than other sexualized games."
537,<|emo_disgust|> You're an ass.
538,<|emo_disgust|> You're a monster!
540,<|emo_disgust|> >it's a fucking disgrace what the media has done to our democracy since [NAME] took office. Go fuck yourself.
542,<|emo_disgust|> This shit is just crazy
543,<|emo_disgust|> Who the fuck cares. You’re a hypocrite.
544,<|emo_disgust|> No. It’s creepy and weird. Let parents know about it and get parents on their kids.
545,<|emo_disgust|> If she knew this aboutals I'd be very disturbed.
546,<|emo_disgust|> Holy crap that's bad
547,<|emo_disgust|> > because you're not a real woman if you still choose not to wear makeup. What the fuck?
548,<|emo_disgust|> That is incredibly disgusting.
549,<|emo_disgust|> Why did I take you for a ride?
550,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is hurting your pocket, change it now!!!"
551,<|emo_disgust|> She is more likeable than him.
552,<|emo_disgust|> That was more disgusting than the dalai lama.
554,<|emo_disgust|> The [NAME] man is making me sick
555,<|emo_disgust|> A fuckin men
556,<|emo_disgust|> It’s also weird that he isn’t an officer for some reason
557,<|emo_disgust|> Wow so you are quite possibly the worst person on the internet.
558,<|emo_disgust|> Because it’s creepy and weird
560,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, it's a weird thing to be worried about."
562,<|emo_disgust|> The monster!
563,"<|emo_disgust|> Well it's just piss, but piss is still piss"
564,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you
565,<|emo_disgust|> This is my worst fear
566,"<|emo_disgust|> This person should be outed to the world, that shit is sick."
568,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck [NAME] I hate Twitter
569,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, we need more women in politics. I mean it’s the least sexist job out there, right?"
570,<|emo_disgust|> This is creepy and weird. Good riddance to awful garbage.
573,<|emo_disgust|> She's just afraid you might.
574,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh and in case you're wondering, [NAME] is still at SF Weird because he plays for the Kings "
575,<|emo_disgust|> I've been getting lot of weird replies...
576,<|emo_disgust|> The worst part is you’re probably gonna love the video. There’s a good bit of shakycam.
577,<|emo_disgust|> Weird and slightly creepy at the same time.
578,<|emo_disgust|> You're a horrible person.
579,"<|emo_disgust|> Those guys actually care enough to stand up for themselves, and also complain a lot, to really drive home just how much they hate everything and everyone. "
580,<|emo_disgust|> Fuuuuck I want to go kill [NAME] myself but I don't know any places that sell tatkis around this price range.
581,<|emo_disgust|> You've insulted me 3 times in that post. 3 times in 30 days isn't bad at all. You're going to need to grow up a hell of a lot faster than that
582,<|emo_disgust|> The fuck who likes cold showering
583,<|emo_disgust|> You and those people are disgusting.
584,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Dogs have scent glands"" *meows in delight*"
585,<|emo_disgust|> I think you misspelled rags andicans
586,<|emo_disgust|> Why are you so angry?
587,"<|emo_disgust|> But that's not the bad part, is the part where he literally says 'fuuuuck the rangers' while holding a gun.... I can’t believe this"
588,<|emo_disgust|> I just don't feel I'm being taken well by this community.
589,<|emo_disgust|> You sound angry.
590,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a god damn� furry stoner
592,<|emo_disgust|> Because you're an awful human being.
593,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I'm devastated.
594,<|emo_disgust|> That’s awful🤮
595,<|emo_disgust|> Oof he’seyyy falls off
597,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting.
598,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn you're toxic asf
599,<|emo_disgust|> This is painful
600,<|emo_disgust|> I will go as far as to say that this is incredibly dangerous. Imagine if all we do is enforce a color blind approach and get overwhelmed by all the colors and it's not even color blind.
601,<|emo_disgust|> My goodness!
602,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm with you, the door was slamen shut!"
603,<|emo_disgust|> Now this is awkward
604,<|emo_disgust|> He may be a moron but at least he’s being very nice to his fans. You’re lucky he’s a fan of yours but..).
605,"<|emo_disgust|> If he didn’t say it was creepy the way he said it in the commercial, I would think twice about buying his shoes."
606,<|emo_disgust|> This is what makes this so disgusting. Those people have so little common sense they think children need special treatment.
607,"<|emo_disgust|> I can't imagine being a mom, but honestly this sort of thing pisses me off."
608,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst we've gotten as a franchise...
609,"<|emo_disgust|> The new faces don't look cool, does that mean the old faces look old or different?"
610,"<|emo_disgust|> What a weird thing to say, especially coming from a [NAME] fan. "
611,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a disgusting, greedy, envious, jealous, arrogant, and Worldly Man."
613,<|emo_disgust|> It's still disgusting that she wants to force American women to be on birth control.
614,<|emo_disgust|> Why can’t I just hug my mommy and tell her it’s ok
615,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]. They’re both worse.
616,"<|emo_disgust|> That’s a little girl, huh? Gotta remember that. "
617,<|emo_disgust|> You've killed too many innocent people already to worry about.
618,"<|emo_disgust|> This is my lunch. No fries, but I just wanted the bottom of my plate. Sorry you couldn’t have it."
619,<|emo_disgust|> I am a woman. I also have the ability to feel disgusted and repulsive.
620,<|emo_disgust|> You realize that we have a word for people who are so self-absorbed that they'll come upon an excuse to be mean?
621,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst I've ever seen.
622,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I need to head home now.
623,<|emo_disgust|> I’m not mad. I’m disgusted that this could happen.
625,<|emo_disgust|> I can still smell the burnt tire after I've come in.
626,"<|emo_disgust|> Who was it that said, ""To hell with this""? A real man."
627,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, but you made me think of something completely different:Junkies."
628,<|emo_disgust|> Soooo [NAME] is a weirdo
630,<|emo_disgust|> Not really cringe. Just sad.
631,<|emo_disgust|> And I thought he was bad
632,<|emo_disgust|> Not to be a [NAME] but she’s ugly as hell
633,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you?
634,<|emo_disgust|> You're right. It's hard to get a job that requires a college degree.
635,<|emo_disgust|> That was so disgusting. VWP
637,<|emo_disgust|> You fucking need to get out of here with your bullshit.
639,<|emo_disgust|> What are you talking about? He’s a prime-time host on the network that games to the people.
640,<|emo_disgust|> i have started to feel quite disgusted with myself
641,<|emo_disgust|> The fake news media is trying to scare people with these claims.
643,<|emo_disgust|> I'd be suprised if he doesn't have a home base.
644,<|emo_disgust|> What a cuck!
645,<|emo_disgust|> This is the kind of bullshit you're talking about.
646,"<|emo_disgust|> In light of this, I wouldnt be surprised if some of the guys on scene are just waiting for the cops to show up..."
647,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn all these comments. I would've liked to hear from you, OP. (I know they're off reddit but I still care)"
648,"<|emo_disgust|> > This is pretty gross, people should be ashamed of themselves."
649,"<|emo_disgust|> It was such a miserable misstep. [NAME] needed to fire everyone, including [NAME] it seems. This is truly a new low for them."
650,<|emo_disgust|> Man I hate [NAME]. He's a piece of shit and I'm a fan.
651,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating...
652,"<|emo_disgust|> No. We all need to feel like we have something worthwhile to say somewhere, to ourselves, without all the bullshit"
653,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating.
654,<|emo_disgust|> Damn didn’t notice that even if this case were brought before the state supreme court the judge would most likely find for the accuser
655,<|emo_disgust|> We are talking about a 16 year old here.
656,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting. It really is.
657,<|emo_disgust|> When's the show due? I'd love to hear the cast's predictions for the first hour.
658,"<|emo_disgust|> That's pretty lewd, to be lewd about your penis."
660,"<|emo_disgust|> What I’m getting at is [NAME] should take the blame for starting [NAME]. You’re not going to help, even if you’re an eager observer."
662,"<|emo_disgust|> There was a post from a year ago about it being a bit of aoner, but I can't remember what exactly. I probably just saw the episode or that episode. "
663,<|emo_disgust|> That’s what I say when I‘m being insulted by a [NAME]
664,"<|emo_disgust|> There’s this that I remember fondly, it’s almost terrifying when you’re under a lot of stress and your brain automatically recognizes faces and just wants to remember them"
667,<|emo_disgust|> That was brutal.
668,<|emo_disgust|> Worst episode of the entire show
669,<|emo_disgust|> No comments. It’s just sad history because it’s so wrong.
670,<|emo_disgust|> They got a new song video this week but it Looks really bad 🔥
671,<|emo_disgust|> But it’s an extremely uncomfortable and inaccurate photo.
672,<|emo_disgust|> Because no one can tell what lie is since the laws against honesty are so vague and apply to everyone.
673,<|emo_disgust|> She literally looks like [NAME] while she speaks.
674,<|emo_disgust|> That's pretty lewd.
675,<|emo_disgust|> What is scary?
676,<|emo_disgust|> How weird for such a young man to call his own mother in game.
677,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, that’s just the worst I can think to right now."
678,<|emo_disgust|> The worst kind of situation.
679,<|emo_disgust|> It’s pretty cringe
680,<|emo_disgust|> The irony is that his company is profiting off of people's suffering...
681,<|emo_disgust|> How the hell is that comment mean?
683,<|emo_disgust|> Worst news I have heard all season
684,<|emo_disgust|> Worst winter ever :(
685,<|emo_disgust|> Don't they all suck?
686,<|emo_disgust|> Just a few people that were saying [NAME] was way bigger and stronger than him and we all wanted them to back off and agree with [NAME]
687,<|emo_disgust|> i didn t feel angry towards him either
688,<|emo_disgust|> It’s very interesting that the article talks about [NAME] in a negative light. Seems a bizarre way to find out if people are actually horrible people.
689,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn. Didn't know the word ""autism"" existed until this"
690,<|emo_disgust|> There are racist morons everywhere 👌
691,<|emo_disgust|> You're a mean person.
693,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling very resentful of the situation
694,<|emo_disgust|> i feel all resentful and angry and hurt when she looks at me
695,<|emo_disgust|> It’s not even [RELIGION]! It’s hatred of [NAME] and America! And he’s got *all* thevotes!
696,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] makes her YouTube video about dogs, what a fucking naybrainer."
698,<|emo_disgust|> Wow... what a nightmare...
699,"<|emo_disgust|> Shut up, [NAME]!"
700,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn it [NAME].
701,<|emo_disgust|> Just call it what it is: a hate crime.
703,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck you're toxic too
704,<|emo_disgust|> i was feeling resentful and angry
705,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm going to say it anyway, because no one will believe me if I say it. You're not wrong. "
706,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is the worst coach in bulls history
707,"<|emo_disgust|> They're a bunch of liars, fascists, and worst of all, psychopaths."
709,<|emo_disgust|> The world is a cruel and unusual punishment. But the government has done terrible things in the name of compassion.
710,<|emo_disgust|> >tf what a fucking idiot haha Fuck off.
711,<|emo_disgust|> He probably thinks that doing stupid shit is cool and he's entitled to his opinion.
712,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing left from my entire life was a pissed off uncle.
713,<|emo_disgust|> Well at least she'll find it's a good insurance policy if she suffers an accident
714,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird. I thought this was a mostly empty arena but I am actually really surprised it doesn't get more intense
715,<|emo_disgust|> What a disgusting character to use for something like this
716,"<|emo_disgust|> This is just child abuse, pure and simple. No adult should ever author a book with this vile invective. Sad but true."
717,"<|emo_disgust|> Who is more pathetic, [NAME] or [NAME]. Who cares about their XD XD"
718,"<|emo_disgust|> That guy probably saw something awful while jerking off, and didn't see the error."
719,<|emo_disgust|> Just shitpost if you want to.
720,<|emo_disgust|> That’s a big meal.
721,<|emo_disgust|> > We have to agree with everything [NAME] says to try and just move on Well fuck
722,<|emo_disgust|> You are very creepy.
723,"<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell thought he was dead, seriously."
724,<|emo_disgust|> What a shit twat
725,<|emo_disgust|> I would be furious.
726,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME]...
727,<|emo_disgust|> And the worst part is that you’re supporting them by buying their shoes..
728,<|emo_disgust|> When it comes to driving it’s hard to read. So we do what every other country does. Have a listening device and block the road with our cars.
729,<|emo_disgust|> This one is also bad but he does say “vote your conscience” like that's all you're going to get in order to get out.
730,<|emo_disgust|> He was the worst Of any sports team Unis!!!
731,<|emo_disgust|> Oh yeah?
732,<|emo_disgust|> Lol that sucks good luck next time youre up against [NAME].
733,<|emo_disgust|> Lol I'm a student and an IT professional. I'm not a medical doctor.
734,<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck? Who likes cold showers Dude. Get some new clothes you fool.
735,<|emo_disgust|> Oh my gosh! Your sister had a baby who died! /s
736,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fucking monster.
737,<|emo_disgust|> I miss being little 😭😭😭😭
738,<|emo_disgust|> There was a violent attack on a Cong Congolese politician in the centre of Kinshasa last week.
739,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting
740,<|emo_disgust|> This is a bad post and you should feel bad for being the author
742,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]
743,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is ugly af
744,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] makes me want to die!
745,"<|emo_disgust|> It's a weird thing to do, I'll let you in on a little secret."
746,"<|emo_disgust|> You don't know anything about the internet, and don't have any contacts with the press."
747,<|emo_disgust|> This fucken masterpiece
748,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] looks so dumb for liking her. Lol
749,<|emo_disgust|> In this day and age it’s absolutely disgusting how many idiots keep saying these things.
750,<|emo_disgust|> He is terrible at his jobs
751,<|emo_disgust|> I am more than sure there is someone who has gone through worse and feels even worse than mine....
752,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] fucking [NAME] please no
753,<|emo_disgust|> i feel selfish and greedy
754,"<|emo_disgust|> You will remember it as “Fuck Yes, Baby!!!”"
755,<|emo_disgust|> You are disgusting.
756,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is the asshole.
757,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst I've ever seen. Take my upvote.
758,"<|emo_disgust|> And it wouldn't be bad if it was... Well, you get a girl with whom you haven't sex before, and then a guy who sucks at sex and can't enjoy sex? Oh, wait. "
759,<|emo_disgust|> i remember feeling incredibly frustrated before we headed home together
760,<|emo_disgust|> You are disgusting and need to be rid of you
761,<|emo_disgust|> > they should either get fired or get court ordered to pay damages. No. But their lawyers will fight to get them evicted. Very strange
762,<|emo_disgust|> That's a lot of calories!
763,<|emo_disgust|> Damn those refs actually fucking hate us.
764,<|emo_disgust|> This sounds one of those things where [RELIGION] is the actual bad place.
765,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking hate [NAME]!
766,<|emo_disgust|> You're in for a rude awakening if you keep them up.
767,<|emo_disgust|> That was a hell of a tip. That's good to know
768,<|emo_disgust|> And we wonder why the world is still round but us humans are flat earthians.
769,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird that we have the same amount of playoff wins as them yet we're considered cheapskates.
770,<|emo_disgust|> It really does be like that but not for long.
771,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, they're all awful. Everyone is just awful in their own way, so not everyone is an asshole. But yeah, they range from awful all the way through to just horrible. "
772,<|emo_disgust|> She's one of us. I'm not complaining. She should be free to run with it and have it done better.
773,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] should tell him that if he votes ""no"" on any of these we will legal action and complain to the highest bodies of the law and the people will know what is going on and will decide what to do"
774,<|emo_disgust|> The weird thing is you don't even hear much of a debate in here except for people who hate the game already.
775,<|emo_disgust|> No joke about your age
776,<|emo_disgust|> The title is pretty insulting and belittling.
777,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm not sorry, but I have a hard time sleeping in socks."
778,<|emo_disgust|> Well damn.
779,<|emo_disgust|> i feel irritated while holding a piece of bread to my mouth which is normally disgusting
780,"<|emo_disgust|> No, she’s not. Stop being angry so hard. "
781,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I’m not the one who is a fan of the original show who just hates everything about it
783,<|emo_disgust|> The only way to make an analogy funnier is to use the analogy as the reason for why people aren't worth listening to.
784,<|emo_disgust|> He's just a buffoon and he can't stand being compared toable past buffoons.
785,<|emo_disgust|> What a load of old shite.
786,<|emo_disgust|> They do suck.
787,<|emo_disgust|> I’ve never seen a dead bear so big my heart races
788,<|emo_disgust|> Oh I wish they were more diverse or at least had an issue with portrayals of black onscreen.
789,<|emo_disgust|> The comment was so terrible. I had to rewind it and rewatch it to understand it better.
791,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] fuck those creeps
792,<|emo_disgust|> It’s hard to tell for sure [NAME] is pregnant? Seems a bit weird to leave a baby on the babysitter couch though.
793,<|emo_disgust|> The weird flex they did where he's trying to slap a woman and her hand is bigger than her face is a good reminder to OHHH.
794,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, [NAME] really is nothing but a scammer and liar. Hope he loses the money he's collecting from auto parts companies and gets serious about saving Detroit. "
795,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is the worst
796,"<|emo_disgust|> They're being an awful lot likeable for the sake of an awful lot of awfulness, pretty obnoxious and disgusting."
797,<|emo_disgust|> That was truly disgusting
798,<|emo_disgust|> There is literally no path for [NAME] to get out of the bed...
799,<|emo_disgust|> This. What a nightmare.
800,<|emo_disgust|> The only problem is if you're a woman and the men who are against you are the same ones who cheered you for being against [RELIGION] and now are supporting you against [RELIGION]. Interesting how it does that
801,<|emo_disgust|> There is nothing immoral about dating people. What a terrible society we live in.
802,<|emo_disgust|> That’s disgusting. What country is this?
804,<|emo_disgust|> You could argue that they did and it was a bad thing.
805,<|emo_disgust|> It's a bit creepy.
806,"<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting, and really disgusting for the people doing this. Tell her to stop doing bad things, and show her remorse. "
807,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has been in the league of stars i dont know how he doesnt have some sort of self image issue and he does seem to be the most honest when he talks about his past
808,<|emo_disgust|> She's just a dumbass.
809,<|emo_disgust|> This is one of the weirdest I've seen.
810,<|emo_disgust|> It's like the worst dream I've ever had.
811,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck I’m sitting in position 3 right now
812,<|emo_disgust|> Omg yes lol
813,<|emo_disgust|> I had a similar fear and was very excited for the ability to find a local brendan on the website but it never actually worked.
814,"<|emo_disgust|> If you take out all the blame, you're blamed for it."
815,<|emo_disgust|> That’s disgusting. You should be ashamed for spreading such disgusting things.
816,<|emo_disgust|> The only job I would have liked to do as an Exceptional [NAME] there are too many others who were more concerned with getting a 'box'.
817,<|emo_disgust|> It's the worst when it's something you've been thinking about for a while.
818,<|emo_disgust|> Just look at that shit-eating grin
820,<|emo_disgust|> Lol stop caring. I actually think you're very cute for posting that.
821,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry this has to be such a bad list, I feel for you. Have some self control! "
822,<|emo_disgust|> I hate it but no.
823,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I'll have hot dogs and beer in the den, ok buddy?"""
824,"<|emo_disgust|> How dare they not have a working grave at home. Your ignorance, your hatred for society, and your pride should be off limits."
825,<|emo_disgust|> You need to write a book about the reasons you left. This is the stuff that students need to know.
826,<|emo_disgust|> What in the actual fuck....
827,<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry I imagine that was devastating.
828,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn it
829,<|emo_disgust|> In reply the guy was furious saying he was being an asshat.
830,"<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I'm so sorry you had that experience, that loneliness can be so awful."
831,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fat luddite
833,<|emo_disgust|> We got separated for the first time in our lives. It feels like forever because I'm the only one he cares about
834,<|emo_disgust|> Whoa I think its weird to be a human being but.. here ya go
835,"<|emo_disgust|> This looks fucking sick, das a fuckin bootlicking bastard"
836,"<|emo_disgust|> I was at the games last year, too! My brother has passed away and we were each other in his arms for three and a half months after the tragedy. "
837,<|emo_disgust|> The only way you can be worse than [NAME] is by allowing him to use performance enhancing drugs which is what happened here.
838,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I'm so sorry you were victimized like that. I hope you find some healing in anyway.
839,<|emo_disgust|> They do their job with enough skill and dedication to be annoying or annoying you.
840,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I want to go there now!
841,<|emo_disgust|> He was just awful for us. Absolutely awful.
842,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird, I'm a woman. I'm on my period and my period is making me extremely crampy."
843,<|emo_disgust|> i feel a little frustrated because no matter what kind of job i have to find to get that money i havent felt like i can make a living yet
844,"<|emo_disgust|> Because of this, I believe most sexualizedized images of girls will be made easily."
845,<|emo_disgust|> What? It's a long history that they were guilty
846,<|emo_disgust|> This shirt is directly aimed at some very ugly individuals.
847,<|emo_disgust|> The longer you look the worse it gets.
848,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking hate that [NAME] episode.
849,<|emo_disgust|> But if it's fake news why would they report on a story about a company that's been cheating its customers for years?
850,<|emo_disgust|> i feel greedy and sad
851,<|emo_disgust|> When he was caught on video throwing a temper tantrum in the Rangers dressing room
852,<|emo_disgust|> i feel weird writing about him
853,<|emo_disgust|> The absolute worst.
854,<|emo_disgust|> I’m an angry elf
855,<|emo_disgust|> i feel selfish but i did what i felt was best
856,<|emo_disgust|> You've never been to Dallas? It's only minutes from San Antonio. Worst city in the country though
857,<|emo_disgust|> That has gotten me killed a few times lately.
859,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is getting a bad rating from RTP, what a fuckin n"
860,<|emo_disgust|> This isn't a new thing. People who feel this way decades ago can be very angry and defensive of things they know others say.
861,<|emo_disgust|> I don't believe in [RELIGION] I don't believe in theistic teaching I don't believe in theistic saviorism
862,<|emo_disgust|> That's just...ugly.
863,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, the horror!"
865,<|emo_disgust|> I hated it so much I quit watching after the second episode
866,<|emo_disgust|> Who has the worst internet
867,<|emo_disgust|> i was feeling very hateful towards myself
868,<|emo_disgust|> Lol the weird way u/KillerBuckets works btw. Thanks for the gold
869,<|emo_disgust|> They have to pay for you to not come. Not nice.
870,"<|emo_disgust|> Why so disgusting, so cringy, I almost downvoted it."
871,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not getting one. I like the sound of it but it's actually pretty bad.
872,<|emo_disgust|> He’s honestly making me the worst of [NAME] even though he’s always been pretty good when it comes to catching the pass.
873,<|emo_disgust|> A big pile of shite.
875,<|emo_disgust|> So. Damn. Greasy.
876,<|emo_disgust|> Those women are just awful.
877,<|emo_disgust|> Wow I never knew about these places. I'm shocked I didn't know about them.
878,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, I wish we could just agree to disagree. That would be a much more palatable alternative."
879,<|emo_disgust|> That day was absolutely Absolutely WORTH IT.
880,"<|emo_disgust|> He needs to be the head of state, he’s only 20."
881,<|emo_disgust|> What? She’s a grown woman! What is she trying to say?!?!?!
883,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds awful. I'm sorry.
885,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst thing I have seen today
886,<|emo_disgust|> Well unless you're a racist and an idiot you don't have any ground to stand on.
887,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not sure what she's talking about but holy heck I'm frustrated as all hell over the fact that our defense is allowing an average of 20 points per 100 possessions when we're in the top 10.
888,<|emo_disgust|> So much fake news.
889,"<|emo_disgust|> There is a fine line between love and hate, you decide. If you are not experiencing both it's not a problem. "
890,"<|emo_disgust|> He is bad for building that wall, but maybe it’s the other way around."
891,<|emo_disgust|> This isn't exactly what you said.
892,<|emo_disgust|> What a load of old sh*t.
893,"<|emo_disgust|> She’s not the best choice for politician, but damn do she have some guts!"
894,<|emo_disgust|> Your wife is disgusting. I'm sorry you had to deal with her. Have a nice day.
895,<|emo_disgust|> And if that's the case then there you go. We got an actual bad hire here.
896,"<|emo_disgust|> They didn't know what was going on, and so when [NAME] got the chance with the other girl he turned around and went off and did it himself. Fucking selfish."
897,"<|emo_disgust|> It's just stupid questions. Like ""did [NAME] say yes"""
898,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, they must really hate you, since you told them your real name. "
899,"<|emo_disgust|> It’s so stupid, and people who are like that do stupid stuff."
901,"<|emo_disgust|> There's a weird ""got married"" sub, it's where you go to find weird stuff like this"
902,<|emo_disgust|> i really feel the least rushed in my thoughts of my own emotional responses to watching this
903,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch! My heart!
904,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck it I'll become a butterfly
905,<|emo_disgust|> I think it's absolutely disgusting that we let this happen.
906,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] just made his post history public, and all I can think of is some horrible shitposting."
907,<|emo_disgust|> I had the worst memory of my life until I had this.
908,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that you think like this is terrifying.
909,<|emo_disgust|> Your mom sucks.
910,"<|emo_disgust|> My dad has had these for 10 years. He's never once said anything racist against me, ever. "
911,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn is that fucking real
912,"<|emo_disgust|> This is the saddest thing I've seen on reddit today. That's just so sad. Your society has fucked you up so bad, I'm so sorry."
914,<|emo_disgust|> This is why we do science. So we can be outraged when a study supports our view.
915,<|emo_disgust|> I'm from Canada and we don't joke about our grief because it's hard
916,<|emo_disgust|> You fucking liar.
917,<|emo_disgust|> You can talk shit about fascism. It's pretty obvious. Fuck off with your petty shit and focus on something real :)
918,<|emo_disgust|> Wow that’s crazy and I can’t imagine. What a terrible person she is.
920,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, I didn't know that shit was in my mouth."
921,<|emo_disgust|> I have heard this story before but it is so awful. I feel so bad for the girl.
922,"<|emo_disgust|> No, but the level of evidence required to support an allegation of rape is simply abysmal. "
923,<|emo_disgust|> That was an absolute chub. I was so disappointed
925,"<|emo_disgust|> Because there are people who really hate the word ""libertarian"" and think its somehow associated with anarchism."
926,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I don't have time for this, I have a family to attend to!"""
927,<|emo_disgust|> Don't judge our love
928,<|emo_disgust|> But there'll always be a world of dumb people out there that still believe all of this.
929,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]... That's just wrong.
930,"<|emo_disgust|> It's okay, it wasn't the real murder."
931,<|emo_disgust|> No we don't. Now we’re gonna ask a guy to not have his phone inspected and possibly lose their job because of it. Fuck off. 
932,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] I hate those
933,<|emo_disgust|> Who told you what you thought?
934,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I hope she can find a long-term relationship outside of porn that she can get into.
935,<|emo_disgust|> This is so creepy. Good riddance to terrible rubbish.
936,<|emo_disgust|> That's not an acceptable answer.
937,<|emo_disgust|> That’s why he’s in jail now. What a fucking croc.
938,<|emo_disgust|> I know a guy named [NAME] that is like 9 months older than me.
939,<|emo_disgust|> That's not true at all. People are disgusting and insane.
940,"<|emo_disgust|> What a bummer for you, but only because Amazon is only giving you shitty deals on games you own."
941,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like i should be shocked
942,"<|emo_disgust|> No. They don't. There's literally zero chance. Stop blaming them though, you fucking idiot."
943,<|emo_disgust|> The most disgusting thing about this picture is the dog
945,<|emo_disgust|> I don’t care. I hate Reddit.
946,<|emo_disgust|> Now THAT IS a murder by words!
947,"<|emo_disgust|> He said to me and he said, “""I know that”"" (tongue in cheek) ""I want to make him look bad in front of your ex"" “(i don’t know what it is but i definitely felt it)"
950,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh boy here we go with that old saw. ""Duck, run away from me"""
951,<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest things about this are the people who actually bought into it.
952,<|emo_disgust|> What a complete and utter cunt.
953,<|emo_disgust|> Wow i hate my life
956,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] a fucking hatter?
957,<|emo_disgust|> I hate it too. But I have to. :(
958,"<|emo_disgust|> >it might be wrong, but it's still really weird. He is actually quite right?"
959,<|emo_disgust|> Damn is it?
960,<|emo_disgust|> This is the saddest thing I've seen today. Someone save this before I lose interest. 
961,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has fucked this up worse than [NAME] has fucked it up. His confidence and tenacity is scary.
962,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has been in the league of QB's that are above average in sack completion percentage when pressured.
963,<|emo_disgust|> I still hate SpaceJaw? The voice actor is amazing and the JAW scene was so awful.
964,<|emo_disgust|> Well.. just think about how much you would save by not paying your fair share..
965,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, you were never rude to her. You might want to take a while to think about how rude you've gotten."
966,<|emo_disgust|> You've had enough. Stay alive and well and look after yourself!!
967,"<|emo_disgust|> No, it's about as dumb as ""calling your mom a c*nt to you knowing she's breast-feeding your retarded little [NAME]."" Like the actual parents!"
968,<|emo_disgust|> It's a weird problem.
969,"<|emo_disgust|> How dare you, as an online shopping channel, dare to show a child your commercials?"
970,<|emo_disgust|> Because people are generally far less compassionate than animals.
971,<|emo_disgust|> i feel a little weird about blogging in this way but youre pretty awesome for doing it
972,<|emo_disgust|> Lol I’ve been on reddit a lot lately and seen a lot of mean memes too.
973,<|emo_disgust|> This is so creepy/sad...
974,<|emo_disgust|> People are people too. Just because you hate them/her does not mean you're a monster. /s
975,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] wept.
976,"<|emo_disgust|> >it will lead to more violence No, no violence, no happiness"
977,<|emo_disgust|> That looks disgusting.
978,<|emo_disgust|> If I had a pet to keep and feed I would gladly take a piece of garbage cat food for myself as it's a cheaper alternative to the food I get from commercial cat food companies
979,<|emo_disgust|> This is the first I’ve seen of him using ‘palm oil’ to make his makeup Looks New Jersey based
980,<|emo_disgust|> I really can't imagine an intelligent adult writing something racist towards a child.
981,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds a little paranoid
982,<|emo_disgust|> I can't do that! Burn it!
983,<|emo_disgust|> What a load of crap!!
984,<|emo_disgust|> He has a fucking gun oh look a fucking human head!
985,<|emo_disgust|> Holy fucking shit
986,<|emo_disgust|> Oh I see it now
987,<|emo_disgust|> You forgot his name.
988,<|emo_disgust|> He has a very weird and perhaps racist past
989,"<|emo_disgust|> She is not in fact a ""leader"" of the left, she just thinks Leftists are stupid."
990,<|emo_disgust|> This team needs to tighten up in the third. Absolutely brutal.
991,<|emo_disgust|> The way they are packing the damned things is just about the worst artistic impression I have ever seen.
992,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a badscaster. Not only does he voice theAME type of program but he also has a unique voice for it.
993,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] said it best back in November, ""I don't get enough shit for being greedy and pissing off all the liberals that I know"""
994,"<|emo_disgust|> He was never a bad defender, but I think he's a bit of a lets shit talker with the ball."
995,<|emo_disgust|> The first picture is creepy as hell. The second one is even creepier.
996,<|emo_disgust|> He reminds me of my crazy sister. Just a ball of nervousness and constantly just on the verge of crying....
997,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], she's actually just awful."
998,<|emo_disgust|> That was an awful open shot....
1000,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, if it was me I would've sued to have them not be able to say that and still get my money "
1001,<|emo_disgust|> They were talking about a different game which i didnt feel was wrong
1002,<|emo_disgust|> How is that not child abuse? I hate to say it but what a horrible person she is
1005,"<|emo_disgust|> They do not all do, but there are some that really stand out."
1006,"<|emo_disgust|> That was dirty. Now that the dust has settled, we should all be more careful about how much we trust those stories"
1007,<|emo_disgust|> I don’t care what anyone says I love fighting games
1008,"<|emo_disgust|> I was just in shock when they used the word ""reeducated"" in reference to [NAME], but hey that's just part of life. "
1010,<|emo_disgust|> They’re all trash.
1011,<|emo_disgust|> But this is the first time I’ve ever felt like I have Toey...the poor dog.
1012,<|emo_disgust|> > It's not the job of a teacher to correct bad behavior. It's the job of the teacher to foster student learning and develop positive change.
1013,<|emo_disgust|> Omg stop spamming.
1014,<|emo_disgust|> She is more into herself than with you.
1015,<|emo_disgust|> This is a veryboyscious example of when an ad shows a woman crying and being abused than presents the man as strong and powerful.
1016,<|emo_disgust|> Thats really disgusting. Im so sorry for your loss
1017,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm with you, pitty, ugly and all."
1018,<|emo_disgust|> Oh my gosh!!
1019,<|emo_disgust|> It is so goddamn creepy
1020,"<|emo_disgust|> This is what I'm thankful for for, I had no idea before now"
1021,<|emo_disgust|> Well I do but idk what to say... Have a nice day.
1022,<|emo_disgust|> I have no idea either. I'm just disgusted that your disgusting lie could even possibly be believed.
1023,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is just jealous of [NAME]
1024,<|emo_disgust|> Because it's so incredibly cringy.
1025,<|emo_disgust|> People were so angry and disgusted that [NAME] was allowed to become US president.
1026,"<|emo_disgust|> She's not wrong at all. I'd say she is mostly correct in that, at least in theory."
1027,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing I saw was him trying to buy one of them tbh they are all so worthless
1028,<|emo_disgust|> Lol no way [NAME] should leave
1029,<|emo_disgust|> You'll think he's stupid if he thinks he can get away with this.
1031,"<|emo_disgust|> Damnit, now I'm mad."
1033,<|emo_disgust|> I feel you. I hate seeing [NAME] used in this light.
1034,"<|emo_disgust|> You have a very creepy, young child, and that is age 7. I’m not sure how she could care for him at that age, I feel like she could be a psychopath "
1035,<|emo_disgust|> That's horrible. I'm so heartbroken for you and her.
1036,<|emo_disgust|> How is it racist...I'm ashamed you're even coming to that.
1037,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird, they're all equally horrible tbh."
1038,<|emo_disgust|> Well that sucks really bad. But well that's the best we can do. I wish the worst had never happened but it would have.
1039,<|emo_disgust|> She's a terrible host.
1040,<|emo_disgust|> Holy fucking shit.
1041,<|emo_disgust|> People still have no idea what the [RELIGION] bulls did to India.
1042,<|emo_disgust|> Wow more drunk than me
1044,<|emo_disgust|> This is my god damn favorite
1045,<|emo_disgust|> The only way I could ever feel like this is if I slept next to him
1046,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing worse than this little dude is a $1500 suit waiting to be christened in his honor at an event run by the NRA
1047,<|emo_disgust|> Worst advice ever. I would save this for a friend who has been through worse!
1048,<|emo_disgust|> It's disgusting.
1049,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like i can only make me so mad and frustrated in my mind if im a little bit guilty of being angry in the first place
1050,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, I don't think that'll happen either but if so what are the chances?"
1051,<|emo_disgust|> >it's harder to be an asshole while being a libertarian lol go ask any libertarian what their problem is if it is an easier issue to be an asshole than not being an asshole
1053,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh damn, I totally forgot about that episode! Well, at least I think I did, or at least I tried. "
1054,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing you should be screaming for is a little vacation from work. And we all know how you do that
1055,<|emo_disgust|> >[NAME] I hate him.
1056,<|emo_disgust|> And even worse after 40 years!
1058,<|emo_disgust|> Well it wasnt by 20 points!
1060,<|emo_disgust|> That’s why I hate them so much.
1061,<|emo_disgust|> That's one lousy pic. Shame.
1062,<|emo_disgust|> They're both badasses but I think our [NAME] likes her a lot better.
1063,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I’m so sad for internet cats.
1064,"<|emo_disgust|> >[NAME] I like the sound of that, that's awful"
1065,<|emo_disgust|> You're a terrible person.
1066,<|emo_disgust|> How dare they?! We live in a country with laws and they are honored and enforced. You can be rude and obnoxious to police.
1067,"<|emo_disgust|> That said, you also might be a weirdo."
1068,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm a [NAME] fan and I'm disgusted that these are some of the worst memes out there, honestly."
1069,"<|emo_disgust|> Why is it okay to beat people up over the idea ""boys should be girls"""
1070,<|emo_disgust|> I don't believe in free will. You get to make choices and then they go in whatever direction you decided.
1071,"<|emo_disgust|> There's no end game in sight, but it's definitely worse than previous generations."
1072,<|emo_disgust|> They’re a bunch of patsies of the very worst kind
1073,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Fuck off, loser"""
1074,<|emo_disgust|> So true it hurts.
1075,<|emo_disgust|> You're a horrible person
1077,<|emo_disgust|> Don't listen to much prog though :(
1078,<|emo_disgust|> i have a feeling if i don t come out this way i may regret not coming this far to find such an acctive on this sub
1080,<|emo_disgust|> This is terrible
1081,"<|emo_disgust|> I thought it was just a picture of [NAME] doing that, but now I know it’s real"
1082,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling really annoyed as you can see
1083,<|emo_disgust|> They both bad
1084,<|emo_disgust|> I just want to be with [NAME].
1085,"<|emo_disgust|> And, of course, there's still [NAME] and the absurd max contract for him. But the Nets have a lot worse talent than that."
1086,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, [NAME] has only gotten worse since his heyday with the Suns"
1087,<|emo_disgust|> My bad lol...
1088,<|emo_disgust|> I don’t get it :(
1089,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I’m getting fired
1090,<|emo_disgust|> I would be creeped out.
1091,"<|emo_disgust|> The one where [NAME] gets her ass handed to her, with a little help from [NAME] to boot."
1092,"<|emo_disgust|> Well you still have two jobs to go on then, sorry you have to work so many shitty jobs"
1094,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a very dangerous woman
1095,<|emo_disgust|> That's pretty lewd. A guy's gotta have a little sex drive to get that off...
1096,<|emo_disgust|> That'd be horrible
1097,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking pug
1098,<|emo_disgust|> What’s more disgusting than this?
1099,<|emo_disgust|> I don't. I loved [NAME] but he has regressed since his rookie year.
1101,<|emo_disgust|> What the FUCK.
1102,"<|emo_disgust|> It would make her seem whiny, cruel and perhaps even possibly an impostor."
1103,<|emo_disgust|> A shitty argument too.
1104,<|emo_disgust|> Now that's creeped me out.
1105,<|emo_disgust|> You're a monster.
1106,<|emo_disgust|> I wanna die
1107,<|emo_disgust|> They’re weird people.
1108,<|emo_disgust|> How dare he not give his blessings to [NAME]. What a fucking idiot.
1109,"<|emo_disgust|> It's not true. There is a ""don't ask questions about them"" rule that every school has to follow. That's not true."
1110,<|emo_disgust|> The worst part is people on here think being bad on /r/badpatrol means being an animal.
1111,<|emo_disgust|> The best way is to find a girl who can be a good friend to you. Try to talk to her a lot.
1112,<|emo_disgust|> Damn..
1113,<|emo_disgust|> The problem is his body. Stop with all the body hair and plastic surgery. Get real.
1114,<|emo_disgust|> Not happy.
1115,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] no you're fine
1116,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is just killing it right now. Play hard and they will come for you.
1117,<|emo_disgust|> i was pretty distraught at that point for a host of reasons and it seems like i went from being very happy in that life to utterly hating it because of that in a matter of months
1118,<|emo_disgust|> He is such a fucking dork...
1119,"<|emo_disgust|> Who are these angry young men? They are angry because [NAME] left like a week ago, they are angry because [NAME] has not been here for a month- longer than [NAME] has, and they are angry because [NAME] did more for their city than [NAME]"
1120,<|emo_disgust|> It sucks but it has to be.
1121,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like theyre so annoyed with me
1122,"<|emo_disgust|> That face must have been OkCYCLE friendly, he looked like he had just walked in off the pier."
1123,<|emo_disgust|> Man damn this gif gets worse and worse the more it is watched
1124,<|emo_disgust|> This is absolutely disgusting.
1125,<|emo_disgust|> But is that rape? Can one individual person's opinion define the rape of other people?
1126,<|emo_disgust|> I hate when I’m wrong 🤔
1127,"<|emo_disgust|> If you like [NAME], you don't like [NAME]. Stay out of it."
1129,"<|emo_disgust|> When he took the mic, I felt like screaming."
1130,<|emo_disgust|> They look like cheap knockoffs of real yankees shuttles.
1131,<|emo_disgust|> What a waste of packaging and time
1132,"<|emo_disgust|> That feels so fake, so fake 🤔"
1133,<|emo_disgust|> You are a disgusting prat and a disgrace to the species
1134,<|emo_disgust|> What a moron.
1135,<|emo_disgust|> They get worse and worse
1136,<|emo_disgust|> My bad. I didn't get the drop off for you guys so I was kinda livid. Hopefully I wasn't the only one. Thanks for the replacement
1137,<|emo_disgust|> I love it when people assume things.
1138,"<|emo_disgust|> Now if you can’t show any evidence that your religion is wrong,....uhh *screams in half whisper* how can I find any faith?..."
1139,<|emo_disgust|> You're a disgusting piece you disgusting human being.
1140,<|emo_disgust|> He looks like he's going to the gym for like 15 minutes and not eating. Ugh
1141,"<|emo_disgust|> The last 3 words, ""after I"" make me want to die"
1142,"<|emo_disgust|> There's something fishy going on atwood either way, and I'm really not sure which it is"
1143,<|emo_disgust|> I got a weird vibe from her outfit
1144,"<|emo_disgust|> And the worst part is she thought the game was over so she asked for the game to be her ""rescue""... again."
1145,"<|emo_disgust|> I think your brother-in-law broke the law. Not surprising given the circumstances, given his previous attitude and track record."
1146,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] should be more worried about the op than him
1149,<|emo_disgust|> I was petrified...
1150,<|emo_disgust|> Damn. It’s almost like our environment is so fucked. We’re not doing much to help it but we can do a lot to change it. This is all so fucked!
1151,"<|emo_disgust|> You might have an argument. She's not an ""expert"". A lot of people in this thread are."
1152,<|emo_disgust|> i can go fuck myself with this comment
1153,<|emo_disgust|> You poor sap.
1154,<|emo_disgust|> That last one's ridiculous.
1155,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is so damn awful tonight you think it would be that bad if you put on your skeptical optimistic Dodger sweatshirt
1156,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah fuck off.
1157,"<|emo_disgust|> There's no need to shame yourself, it's obvious you're a drama queen. "
1158,<|emo_disgust|> That was dirty.
1159,<|emo_disgust|> This is so creepy and sad. Eleven yearolds are supposed to be shy and embarrassed around older people though...
1160,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing they're hoping for is a miracle.
1161,<|emo_disgust|> This is super creepy.
1162,"<|emo_disgust|> Omg, i was about to say that I fucking hate [NAME] but now i’m just about to say that the reasons behind supporting her cause are probably more valid lol"
1163,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck that.
1164,"<|emo_disgust|> You took her to court for property damage, she decided not to give her side of the story. What a victory. "
1165,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Do you believe in forgiveness? If you don't I won't forgive and you'll get hell unless you're willing to forgive me."""
1169,<|emo_disgust|> Because the leaders want it that way and their buddies are furious
1170,<|emo_disgust|> And that was in the AFC South. Where he went 4-12 in four years. Fucking south.
1171,<|emo_disgust|> I see my post and I get downvoted to hell. How reddit works I don’t care.
1172,<|emo_disgust|> How the Fuck did I Not know this?!
1173,<|emo_disgust|> This is the shitpost from the uncultured
1174,"<|emo_disgust|> When that asshole left, he wasn't offended. He was just pissed he had to travel from California to Texas."
1175,<|emo_disgust|> That was beyond disgusting.
1176,<|emo_disgust|> No but the fact the OP just posted this and wondered if it was because of this thread was extremely unwelcome.
1177,<|emo_disgust|> What in the actual fuck?
1178,<|emo_disgust|> You forgot [NAME] and [NAME] are still good.
1179,<|emo_disgust|> It happened to me once and it left me feeling really bad all day.
1180,<|emo_disgust|> A woman's rights activism “targets the family unit” and not the individuals who she's fighting for. It’s a zero sum game.
1181,<|emo_disgust|> She should either get some help or be FIRED.
1182,"<|emo_disgust|> It's actually worse than I thought it would be. In Minnesota we still only charges for samples, which is ridiculous."
1183,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has to be pissed at us for letting him have those things.
1184,<|emo_disgust|> How can any reasonable person deny these basic facts and argue instead for a racist conspiracy?
1185,<|emo_disgust|> Damn these refs actually fucking hate us.
1186,<|emo_disgust|> Why the fuck do these exist
1187,<|emo_disgust|> i didn t feel rushed or anxious at all
1188,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn you are autistic
1189,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, shame for you; good luck against an old and proven favourite."
1191,<|emo_disgust|> Well there goes my lunch.
1192,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, I think that game is pretty terrible in every way, because mode and difficulty are just as much a problem for that game. "
1193,<|emo_disgust|> This thread is a fucking shill.
1195,"<|emo_disgust|> It's strange, most of [NAME] seem to actually be decent people, and it doesn't really seem like their issues are being brought up at all."
1196,<|emo_disgust|> The fucking worst.
1197,<|emo_disgust|> People call you ugly and stupid and wrong and worthless for calling them ugly and stupid and wrong.
1198,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is pretty damn ugly as well, [NAME] has been pretty decent as well."
1199,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] it fucking sucks
1200,<|emo_disgust|> i hope you feel pissed off or something about it if at all
1201,"<|emo_disgust|> Not just a stupid question, but extremely dangerous."
1202,<|emo_disgust|> Why is that weird
1203,"<|emo_disgust|> Those comments are disgusting, and the owner of the nightclub denied the claims."
1204,"<|emo_disgust|> This is actually kinda interesting, I wonder where it came from?"
1205,<|emo_disgust|> They are so afraid to speak out.
1206,<|emo_disgust|> What a worthless tip.
1208,"<|emo_disgust|> I mean it's still an awful amount of Sesame oil, god, if you look at the calories it wouldn't surprise me if that was a factor."
1209,<|emo_disgust|> This can be taken literally as a threat. It would be a terrible thing to say.
1210,<|emo_disgust|> Sooo disgusting.
1211,<|emo_disgust|> She should stop broadcasting road games
1212,"<|emo_disgust|> Ohh boy, a possible carcinogen? "
1213,"<|emo_disgust|> Ouch, my heart!"
1214,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, so disgusting."
1215,<|emo_disgust|> And the media. You're not special in that respect
1216,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, the guy driving the dump truck seemed pretty drunk the whole time. "
1217,<|emo_disgust|> It also looks like the original browns logo without the Fuckin'ouuck
1218,<|emo_disgust|> This is fucking brilliant
1219,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was horrible. But he was also the most experienced and basically a straight up autist, so you can see why he might get things done in other autistic cultures. It's just hard to understand how it doesn't happen here."
1220,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is just dumb as fuck.
1221,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I wasn't a virgin until six months ago"" [NAME] in a creepy voice"
1222,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]. He looks really fucking creepy.
1223,<|emo_disgust|> It would definitely suck!!
1224,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has played like garbage on and off the court since he got married
1225,<|emo_disgust|> They’re both disgusting.
1226,<|emo_disgust|> Why the fuck do people have sex? It’s just gross?
1227,<|emo_disgust|> The most ridiculous thing my grandmother has said is she loves me more. /s
1228,<|emo_disgust|> So obnoxious!
1229,"<|emo_disgust|> My god, they're so red."
1230,<|emo_disgust|> That’s weird. I don’t really know what to make of that
1231,<|emo_disgust|> And it's gotten so bad that the majority of young people are finding homes because of it.
1232,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting.. OP said you could save him by getting him to a doctor.. OP said that's not the case...
1233,<|emo_disgust|> The other day my boyfriend and I were at aory beach doing nothing but sunbathe. The next day after we left the beach I began feeling really shitty physically. 
1234,<|emo_disgust|> He's creepy
1235,<|emo_disgust|> Well he’s not fat and ugly and all that but the fact that he is a college student in his free time still leaves me a bit disheartened.
1236,<|emo_disgust|> There’s something I never thought about.... Are you saying that the government is allowed to tell people to fuck off or that you think it’s wrong?
1237,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I'm sorry for your loss.
1238,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking hate [NAME] [NAME]
1239,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh wow, your mom was horrible! "
1240,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], they fucking call it a ""cabana"" in Jersey."
1241,"<|emo_disgust|> And yet, our government is not responsible enough to pay its bills. What a joke."
1242,<|emo_disgust|> This is why why we do baseball
1243,<|emo_disgust|> You are extremely disgusting.
1244,<|emo_disgust|> And you say your sister is the one that hates you
1245,"<|emo_disgust|> That dude was beyond cringe-worthy, it was creepy"
1246,<|emo_disgust|> Noted! She must be terrified her son is making all these racist and disgusting comments. I’m so sorry your mom has to go through this. #motheragainstrorism
1247,<|emo_disgust|> Don't give in to the enemy
1248,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, [NAME] is trash as hell. I'm so bad at lists"
1249,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating. Are parents really that stupid?
1250,<|emo_disgust|> I hate this and I hate you. But yes I hate [NAME] too
1251,"<|emo_disgust|> I'd say his brother is worse, but this video shows his brother beating up a kid who was just walking around like a pleasant old man."
1252,<|emo_disgust|> Wow. Are we supposed to be disgusted by disgusting people or are we supposed to believe disgusting people are expected to be disgusted?
1253,"<|emo_disgust|> In fact, he had told me before that he is extremely homophobic. I told him the same thing."
1254,<|emo_disgust|> I can barely remember a time where I didn't hate him on here
1255,"<|emo_disgust|> Why everyone hurts me? Maybe I'm normal, I don't know."
1256,<|emo_disgust|> It's called fascism and it's terrible.
1257,<|emo_disgust|> But she’s ugly
1258,<|emo_disgust|> When have we ever turned the other cheek? When have we ever?
1259,<|emo_disgust|> I have no choice but to remain a human being and choose to end it all. #NoBern
1260,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck this gif
1261,<|emo_disgust|> What a farce.
1262,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck that guy
1263,<|emo_disgust|> This is so creepy and disgusting. I can’t imagine thinking that is even slightly okay
1264,"<|emo_disgust|> I see it all the time on the show. [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], [NAME]. They are all awful. "
1265,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that’s sad
1266,<|emo_disgust|> It's racist.
1267,<|emo_disgust|> People are gross.
1268,<|emo_disgust|> My god this woman is awful
1269,<|emo_disgust|> This is my worst fear when it comes to getting shut down for doing exactly what I said I was going to do...
1270,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm not saying it was bad, I'm saying [NAME] is a rather odd choice for a coach."
1271,"<|emo_disgust|> The absolute worst is ‘my-dad-upper-upper. The one on top is actually just the top right one, lol."
1272,<|emo_disgust|> She looks just like [NAME]. What a fucking dumbass lol
1273,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, no, they were both drunk. She started pushing him while drunk, and even started kicking him while he was on the floor. "
1274,<|emo_disgust|> My brain hurts...
1277,<|emo_disgust|> Because its creepy.
1278,"<|emo_disgust|> I would call and report them right off the bat, harass them constantly"
1279,<|emo_disgust|> The saddest thing is that he thinks Reddit is this superior medium.
1280,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a SHIT ASSISTANCE!
1281,<|emo_disgust|> i just feel very disgusted
1282,<|emo_disgust|> No. Your question is irrelevant to the post's topic. Stop complaining about it.
1283,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] this is why I dont give a fuck about politics *hugs a dog*
1284,<|emo_disgust|> That is horrible. I'm so sorry that you had that type of thinking.
1285,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] that was so terrible
1286,<|emo_disgust|> They really want to. They really fear for their safety.
1287,"<|emo_disgust|> That was a brutal goal, and the goalie made a terrible mistake."
1288,<|emo_disgust|> Wow these stories are real. Hope you are ok.
1289,"<|emo_disgust|> What a useless tool, though. "
1291,<|emo_disgust|> i also feel very tortured right now
1293,<|emo_disgust|> It just makes me feel so selfish as a person
1294,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is when you think you know the person but they just flat out refuse to answer your questions.
1295,<|emo_disgust|> It was a horrible call..... I am a horrible human being for allowing myself to do them...
1296,<|emo_disgust|> That's worse... can you send a picture of your penis?
1297,<|emo_disgust|> It’s just damn creepy
1299,<|emo_disgust|> Why are you shitting me like that
1300,"<|emo_disgust|> If it's a 4-day festival and not a 2-day one, I'm really worried. "
1301,<|emo_disgust|> She looks like she's taking a shower in her pajamas.
1302,<|emo_disgust|> Not everyone gets called [NAME] is that you?
1303,<|emo_disgust|> In the worst shape of your life *hugs*.
1304,<|emo_disgust|> He looks a little bit older!
1305,<|emo_disgust|> I will die and they will laugh
1306,"<|emo_disgust|> He didn't really go for it though. He just stood there and took it as a rude comment. That said, people have made similar comments to him before."
1307,<|emo_disgust|> She’s so mean! She might even try to murder you by throwing a temper tantrum!
1308,<|emo_disgust|> I’m in shock that [NAME] still hasn’tirmed his commitment to Notre Dame
1312,<|emo_disgust|> What a load of old shite...
1313,"<|emo_disgust|> This is a horrible thing to be. But yes, it mostly works like that."
1314,<|emo_disgust|> This game is so dumbed down I’m honestly terrified to come back tox
1315,<|emo_disgust|> You'd be shocked to know that over 90% of men who date complain about getting physically assaulted.
1316,<|emo_disgust|> I’m sorry to hear it. That’s awful
1317,"<|emo_disgust|> So, my life is complete"
1318,<|emo_disgust|> That was so disgusting. VWP.
1319,<|emo_disgust|> That was brutal. Lmao
1320,<|emo_disgust|> She is a pro-Assad piece of shit.
1321,<|emo_disgust|> Who would've thought that a few months ago I hated [NAME].
1322,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I hate it too. But I could be wrong.
1324,<|emo_disgust|> Oh my [NAME] I'm so sorry
1325,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is making some terrible defensive plays.... call it what it is and we're getting it.
1327,<|emo_disgust|> This is a terrible list
1328,<|emo_disgust|> How disgusting
1329,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, you must've never been on /pol/ or like, like 4Chan before? Shit gets real on there."
1330,<|emo_disgust|> That's a weird way of spelling Disenchanted
1331,<|emo_disgust|> My eyes fucked up when I took the picture! I’m sorry!
1332,<|emo_disgust|> I never thought I'd see [NAME] compare to [NAME] but damn I am shocked.
1333,<|emo_disgust|> This is creepy as hell. Hope you and [NAME] are OK.
1336,<|emo_disgust|> You're a cowards
1337,<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry but does anyone know the source?
1338,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] just lost her shoes. What a terrible actress
1339,<|emo_disgust|> This is a hate sub
1340,<|emo_disgust|> I'm actually seeing a lot less of posts about it than I thought. I'm happy for you. 😔
1341,"<|emo_disgust|> I hate when people bring up the fact that you're a man and a child, when really you're a mixture of both. "
1342,<|emo_disgust|> I hate that.
1343,"<|emo_disgust|> You have to be very stupid to call your own flesh a ""blanket""."
1344,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so mad
1345,<|emo_disgust|> This is me all the time. I'm so envious
1347,<|emo_disgust|> I am so sorry for your experience. The community here is amazing and you deserve better. Be well
1348,"<|emo_disgust|> A little girl screaming ""fire the beanbag"" from the window to her distraught motherland would make him feel a little bit better :D"
1349,<|emo_disgust|> I'm a 20 y/o black male and this is disgusting.
1350,<|emo_disgust|> People are dumb and selfish as well when it comes to energy drinks.
1352,"<|emo_disgust|> The way they get downvoted on Reddit is pretty bad, let alone managed to get a blockage there."
1353,"<|emo_disgust|> In the worst of the first half, he almost single handedly changed the game. So much of the second half though is a complete and utter shit show."
1354,<|emo_disgust|> What the heck?
1355,"<|emo_disgust|> That's terrible. Is it illegal in any state to say you don't want Abortion? Tell me, please."
1356,<|emo_disgust|> But she might lose some friends over this
1357,<|emo_disgust|> He wanted a divorce? Stop burdening me with all these guilt trips.
1358,<|emo_disgust|> > it’s one of those situations where I just want to kill you...
1359,<|emo_disgust|> My boyfriends family is crazy from everywhere and our response to getting told off and told off over nothing is pretty shit.
1360,"<|emo_disgust|> No thanks, I like my pockets kief free"
1361,<|emo_disgust|> She doesn't love [NAME] it's hard to hate someone your own age
1362,"<|emo_disgust|> How dare you care about your physical and mental health, you shitlord you you! /s"
1365,"<|emo_disgust|> That's right. It's worse. My boyfriends mum doesn't understand too much, so is my mum."
1366,<|emo_disgust|> They’re both wrong on so many levels.
1367,<|emo_disgust|> That is just extremely creepy.
1368,<|emo_disgust|> Why I’m upset
1369,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a madman..
1370,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, I really wanted to like this until the face I saw in the water turned red."
1372,"<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. You're right, it's awful that the law doesn't recognize same Same-sex couples equally."
1373,<|emo_disgust|> That dress was awful.
1374,<|emo_disgust|> People who have survived an attack by a wild dog might not be so bad at other things either?
1375,<|emo_disgust|> This is awful
1376,<|emo_disgust|> This comment is trash. I can’t even watch it without vomiting.
1377,"<|emo_disgust|> ""You can't have sex with me because I'm a cow."""
1378,<|emo_disgust|> They're not. They're terrifying.
1379,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, goodness, what is wrong with this picture?! It's so damn cute! "
1380,<|emo_disgust|> What a weird way to start Christmas.
1381,<|emo_disgust|> That would almost definitely break his jaw
1382,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I'm so sorry. Stay strong!
1383,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, I just can’t get behind the gun control crap and want everyone to be able to guns."
1384,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucken nastiness Truly is
1385,<|emo_disgust|> Who here has never and will never wear swim trunks to a competition
1386,<|emo_disgust|> What a bummer. Stay in your car. It's not worth the wasted space.
1387,<|emo_disgust|> The only positive thing is it gave you karma (aside from being told to fuck off weeks ago) damn you're lucky you got such a thing.
1388,<|emo_disgust|> It is definitely creepy and weird. I wouldn't want to live in it.
1389,"<|emo_disgust|> If he wants to protect himself, go take up cycling instead. Why waste your life in'shlock'"
1390,<|emo_disgust|> They look so cool on my wife.
1391,"<|emo_disgust|> The irony that the more we are screwed, the more we will want to destroy it."
1392,<|emo_disgust|> I’m so sad that happened
1393,<|emo_disgust|> Just thinking about all the good times we had together made me horny.
1394,<|emo_disgust|> If this is the attitude of the entire game then it’s bad af
1396,<|emo_disgust|> I'm [RELIGION] too bro...
1397,<|emo_disgust|> Now *I’M* mad
1398,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is one disgusting piece of shit
1400,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst I've ever seen. The music is driving the emotions while the spelling mistakes were so awful
1401,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] you better be FUCKING GONE
1403,<|emo_disgust|> It’s disgusting how this [NAME] has been allowed to run his own business for so long. One of the scariest things about this deal are the mega rich families that own these banks.
1404,<|emo_disgust|> They do it every time. You just have to be so disgusted the image makes you nauseous.
1405,<|emo_disgust|> i thought about it then and feel i ve fucked my parents over and should probably not be making them deal with this
1406,<|emo_disgust|> Damn nagel.
1407,<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry but [NAME] is way better
1408,"<|emo_disgust|> You're probably right on the edge. The last couple of times I've felt this awful about being a mourner, it was the worst of times. "
1409,<|emo_disgust|> Ohhhhh she dead
1410,"<|emo_disgust|> Just keep going baby, you're only making this worse."
1412,<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting. Truly disgusting.
1413,<|emo_disgust|> No we're not! We're enjoying it
1414,<|emo_disgust|> He had his critics but he's a hit and run option other than [NAME].. I would have loved to have him been our #2
1415,"<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit, she has worse taste in food than I do!"
1416,<|emo_disgust|> And that’s just creepy as fuck.
1417,"<|emo_disgust|> Not really cringe, just sad."
1418,"<|emo_disgust|> That’s disgusting. Not only that the meat is slaughtered clean on the grill, it’s also served hot. SOOOO disgusting."
1419,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, you'd think there'd be some sort of outraged response to that."
1420,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]...I hate Twitter
1421,<|emo_disgust|> Whataburger misses you.
1422,<|emo_disgust|> I have lived in Florida for 9 years now. Hurricanes are *much* worse.
1423,<|emo_disgust|> Now that’s a dare!
1424,<|emo_disgust|> i feel a little weird about sharing things about myself that are private and don t mean very much to me
1425,<|emo_disgust|> You are a Shameful human being.
1427,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is horrible
1428,"<|emo_disgust|> I mean, the argument they're making is that the government needs to do more to protect us from terrorists. "
1429,<|emo_disgust|> He is a moron. How doyou know that though?
1430,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird crowd, huh?"
1431,<|emo_disgust|> This is the last comment I’m going to make on this shitpost. Fuck reddit.
1432,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking selfish man
1433,<|emo_disgust|> Oh the poor guy
1434,<|emo_disgust|> And that's before they get to hurt him with the taxes again
1435,<|emo_disgust|> That was a stupid call
1436,<|emo_disgust|> No we're talking about season 2
1437,<|emo_disgust|> I can't believe [NAME] actually thinks this.
1439,<|emo_disgust|> Damn is he fat
1440,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was the only other QB to throw a pick 6 since 2000 with at least 15 INT. That’s insane
1441,<|emo_disgust|> And they were all rather drunk.
1443,<|emo_disgust|> That was the worst power play I’ve ever seen
1444,<|emo_disgust|> Why? She’s horrible
1445,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] I think I've never seen a situation where my life was in greater danger of being ruined because i was ager
1446,<|emo_disgust|> She was a virgin on purpose for his benefit. That's just sad.
1447,<|emo_disgust|> I hate when I have to watch [NAME] in the third period then cringe a little when he makes the save.
1448,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm just saying that the whole ""men don't have penises because boys have penis"" is ridiculous."
1449,<|emo_disgust|> That's a really good one too.
1450,<|emo_disgust|> I'll remember this for the rest of my life.
1451,<|emo_disgust|> Oh this poor sap.
1453,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is what the real deal is. Good on him for not giving in, but you can tell by his expression that he's dissatisfied with the situation."
1454,"<|emo_disgust|> What an insecure, insecure little bastard"
1456,<|emo_disgust|> I was thinking the same thing but decided not to let that get in the way
1457,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that’s a good one
1458,<|emo_disgust|> Man I love reddit.
1459,<|emo_disgust|> This is awful and I love it.
1461,"<|emo_disgust|> Don't spend time with people that are short sighted, insecure, self centered, etc."
1462,<|emo_disgust|> This is the perfect example of a fake news article. Perfect examples as well. Fakery at its finest.
1465,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh look, more abuse"
1466,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds awful. I am very sorry for both of you. Stay strong
1467,<|emo_disgust|> I would of helped her! She needs to get her feet off the table.
1468,<|emo_disgust|> That is so disgusting. Im disgusted that anyone in her position could do that.
1469,<|emo_disgust|> I’m not crying.. you’re crying!!
1470,<|emo_disgust|> Don't make me an example of something bad.
1471,<|emo_disgust|> The fuck off.
1472,<|emo_disgust|> Oh my god I forgot about that episode
1473,<|emo_disgust|> I hate when that happens. I'd like to assume they are going to make them more expensive to replace with something else.
1474,"<|emo_disgust|> He had a stroke playing checkers, the players would have kept trying to steal as he falls to the floor."
1475,<|emo_disgust|> What kind of class A moron does that?
1477,<|emo_disgust|> You've made yourself far more vulnerable than you need to be
1478,<|emo_disgust|> Now you’re gonna say something racist. Smh
1479,<|emo_disgust|> My husband and I have been dating for 9 years. After 2 of those years I gave up on relationship things and have been seeing other people for 7.5 years now. This is incredibly hard for me.
1480,<|emo_disgust|> In case it isn't already apparent...I hate [NAME].
1481,"<|emo_disgust|> They are fucking serious, I was literally in tears while they were happening...."
1482,<|emo_disgust|> He didn't know that. He just said something super nasty about me. My feelings are still with him.
1483,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting. No one should act like this to you. I hope your wife finds someone who treats her like a human being instead of a statistic.
1484,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] what a fuckin n
1485,"<|emo_disgust|> He does sound like a little insecure, insecure insecure insecure insecure"
1487,<|emo_disgust|> I hate that I like them...
1488,<|emo_disgust|> He was just a casual fan though. Didn’t really care too much.
1490,<|emo_disgust|> What a bad list
1491,<|emo_disgust|> That was a brutal goal. Unlucky OP.
1492,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh man, that was brutal."
1493,<|emo_disgust|> You can't force people to be in LOVE with you
1494,"<|emo_disgust|> Don't worry, some of you will be fine. "
1495,<|emo_disgust|> The guy lost his shoe? Damn.
1496,"<|emo_disgust|> I was thinking the exact same thing! 😤 Not fun, but I'm okay."
1497,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing that can happen is you get permanently disfigured from one accident
1498,<|emo_disgust|> Because they want to. They just want to Because they want to. They just want to
1499,<|emo_disgust|> What's the fuck you on about now? You said [NAME] was a bad actor?? That was so terrible. He didn't deserve it.
1500,<|emo_disgust|> And the rest is history
1501,<|emo_disgust|> i feel extremely wronged that i am being considered for this post
1503,<|emo_disgust|> I fucking hate this
1504,"<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting. Do your worst, it doesn't look pretty at all."
1505,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is when it's something you are passionate about
1506,<|emo_disgust|> They’re all just jealous of you and all the good things you’ve done for them!
1507,<|emo_disgust|> It’s a hard truth. I hate her so much. I really do.
1508,"<|emo_disgust|> This is horribly disgusting. One of the parents was a doctor. He was doing his job, properly. He should be ashamed for what he did to his patients."
1509,<|emo_disgust|> >the whole point of it is to fuck the rich and powerful. The whole point is to fuck the powerful?
1511,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck I love you prag
1512,<|emo_disgust|> They are fucking destroying Bama...and I say this with all candor. You can rest assured I will not vote for him any time soon
1513,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, poor [NAME] "
1514,<|emo_disgust|> Oh that's so sick! I feel bad for this mother. Well done for your daughter. That's awful.
1515,<|emo_disgust|> This was a horrible call
1516,"<|emo_disgust|> He's saying this about himself, but it's telling that even in his most negative view of himself he still wants this job."
1517,<|emo_disgust|> He looks really hot.
1518,<|emo_disgust|> i feel slightly shamed that my opinion of him is more or less being bandied about
1519,<|emo_disgust|> I wish the guy would die
1520,<|emo_disgust|> Because that's a lot of them :D
1522,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I missed this
1523,<|emo_disgust|> This post fucking sucks because it doesn't cater to my beliefs.
1524,<|emo_disgust|> And the worst is working with dealerships
1525,"<|emo_disgust|> I am so sorry for you and your family, they did the right thing."
1526,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird that his left arm is bigger than his right arm [NAME]
1527,<|emo_disgust|> He must smell terrible when he sweats.
1528,<|emo_disgust|> Well what can you do to her?
1530,"<|emo_disgust|> I hate that I like them, but sometimes I really hate those seen as threats"
1531,"<|emo_disgust|> And there I said it, I'm sticking to it"
1532,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting. We need to send a message to these people that we don't accept their bigotry!
1533,"<|emo_disgust|> I was going to say this, but then I saw the s**t on r/hockey. "
1534,<|emo_disgust|> Don't you've fucked up that mind!
1535,<|emo_disgust|> i don t feel dissatisfied by life nor do i feel like it s something ive to be ashamed of
1536,<|emo_disgust|> That'd be a terrible legal argument.
1537,<|emo_disgust|> I can’t tell. He looks dead to me.
1539,<|emo_disgust|> Well then what the bloody hell is a conspiracy
1540,"<|emo_disgust|> This is weird. Usually these questions seem simple, like what's your favorite drink or what's your favorite food. This is a bit weird."
1543,<|emo_disgust|> A shitpost crosspost
1544,<|emo_disgust|> It seems a bit extreme but the main reason for being involved in a religion is to support your parents
1545,<|emo_disgust|> >I have a deep seeded hatred for the word fascism. Ever thought of that? Fucking hell.
1546,<|emo_disgust|> This shit gets me every time.
1547,<|emo_disgust|> This is literally me!
1548,<|emo_disgust|> I'd piss right on their floor. Fuck that.
1549,<|emo_disgust|> I knew there was a special place in hell for these people!
1551,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is the least disgusting option
1552,<|emo_disgust|> That's worse.
1553,<|emo_disgust|> The fact he's white makes it even more terrifying.
1554,<|emo_disgust|> Damn you're autistic
1555,"<|emo_disgust|> If you haven’t had issues finding doctors in VA, you’re probably not alone. "
1556,<|emo_disgust|> And now [NAME] has an armada of women loyal to him...
1557,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh look, y'all not going to vote for me because of my wife!?"
1558,<|emo_disgust|> This was a complete waste of time.
1559,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is also a very bad defender, much worse than [NAME] I would be surprised to see the Nets worse than the Bulls"
1560,<|emo_disgust|> i feel very offended that i know so many people know i am wrong
1561,<|emo_disgust|> I hope this is a satire then why are people saying this. It's worse but the point still stands.
1562,<|emo_disgust|> So now I am one of them. How unfortunate.
1563,<|emo_disgust|> This is worse than a painting by [NAME].
1564,<|emo_disgust|> This really sucks.
1565,<|emo_disgust|> Who's in control? Where are your morals? Stop spamming.
1566,<|emo_disgust|> He does look damn hot tho
1567,<|emo_disgust|> People in this thread are disgusting.
1568,"<|emo_disgust|> No, it's disgusting that America still believes 30-yearolds are potential rapists."
1569,<|emo_disgust|> There are racist morons everywhere.
1571,<|emo_disgust|> Weird. What’s your relationship like?
1572,<|emo_disgust|> The comment was so awful. I can’t imagine thinking that’s funny.
1573,<|emo_disgust|> And I still don't understand how the [NAME] and [NAME] aren't stars.
1574,"<|emo_disgust|> Worst case scenario, he's become a violent and insane criminal in his own home."
1575,<|emo_disgust|> You don't know what you are talking about.
1576,<|emo_disgust|> It was *600* times worse than the [NAME] report...
1577,<|emo_disgust|> Because it's horrifyingly easy to get enthralled by the cult of personality that is Reddit. 
1578,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like i hated japanese food because i liked sweet treats more as a kid and now it feels like ive hated sweet treats
1579,<|emo_disgust|> Man I swear the majority of these comments are directly directed at the door. Stay out.
1580,<|emo_disgust|> i feel wronged about that
1581,"<|emo_disgust|> The whole ""my man got killed"" thing is pretty cringe."
1582,<|emo_disgust|> I've got a feeling we're gonna be dealing with a lot of back and forth these days.
1583,<|emo_disgust|> We have no choice but to agree to disagree.
1584,<|emo_disgust|> This is bloody disgusting.
1585,"<|emo_disgust|> That's bad. I'm sorry for your loss, this story is heartbreaking."
1586,<|emo_disgust|> This is a horrible idea
1587,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh yeah, I wronged my parents"
1588,<|emo_disgust|> They’re so pathetic.
1589,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] who? No clue
1590,<|emo_disgust|> I've seen this post a million times and it still makes me cringe.
1591,<|emo_disgust|> The least offensive thing about this pic is the use of a washable washable logo
1592,<|emo_disgust|> He’s also the dumbest owner in bulls history
1593,<|emo_disgust|> It was just me and I was pissed. Why didn't she say fuck it
1594,<|emo_disgust|> You're an asshole.
1595,<|emo_disgust|> Just my opinion bud. Maybe there is a better way. I still dont like cheating assholes.
1596,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I think they should ban food stamps, even if just to give them more money for programs that don't really help"
1597,<|emo_disgust|> He’s a selfish prick. It’s sad that this happens in such top tier society. 
1598,"<|emo_disgust|> I can't remember a time in my life where I found a more disgusting, defective, insecure, useless and useless piece of shit than this character."
1600,<|emo_disgust|> Those eyebrows...those Weird Fart Man eyebrows
1602,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] what an asshole. i can t stand him but i can t imagine not wanting to be friends with him.
1603,"<|emo_disgust|> People can't take their eyes off the prize, they're actually going to hate it. "
1604,<|emo_disgust|> This actually sounds a little paranoid
1605,<|emo_disgust|> I dont know how I feel about that
1606,<|emo_disgust|> The most important thing is you don't give up.
1607,<|emo_disgust|> That's such a selfish mentality to have.
1608,"<|emo_disgust|> It's like [NAME] said, but with a far greater focus on the fact he had a prog rock/funk influence and is still a bit of a weirdo. "
1609,<|emo_disgust|> The only negative for her was that the guy she was with then came out and said he still loves her.
1610,<|emo_disgust|> He's a moron.
1611,<|emo_disgust|> > it's stupid What the fuck?
1612,"<|emo_disgust|> This was the most obnoxious, stupid, and offensive thing I've ever read about [NAME]. Disgusting. "
1613,<|emo_disgust|> This is just a front. She can't help herself.
1614,<|emo_disgust|> This is exactly what I told him. That was absolutely infuriating.
1615,<|emo_disgust|> This is the most disturbing thing I've seen on this thread yet.
1618,<|emo_disgust|> Those were his final two drives of the game.... both were pretty bad.
1619,"<|emo_disgust|> The lack of options isn't a bug, it's a feature. And I'm not complaining. "
1620,<|emo_disgust|> She’s disgusting
1621,<|emo_disgust|> Thats so unfortunate for the worker but its entirely his/her choice as to whether or not to go on strike.
1622,<|emo_disgust|> That's so frustrating and shocking to be honest. Whoops.
1623,"<|emo_disgust|> Oops, sorry for my ignorance"
1624,<|emo_disgust|> Damn he is a hungry little bastard.
1625,<|emo_disgust|> How to be a woman: using your own subjective experiences to make your own case
1626,<|emo_disgust|> Well fuck me some more [NAME]
1627,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, if you're talking about the physical health, depression is a bigger consideration."
1628,<|emo_disgust|> It’s still creepy
1629,<|emo_disgust|> We have a lot in common with that drunk ass nazi
1630,<|emo_disgust|> The worst. Watching a puppy being tortured at 3am. Scary stuff
1631,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit that was fucking bad...
1633,<|emo_disgust|> You've got worse things to do than troll. Stop being ridiculous.
1635,<|emo_disgust|> Why didn’t [NAME] get this?! Now look what happened
1636,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] how are you a boy i hate boys but i got a girl and i'm a girl and you've changed me
1637,<|emo_disgust|> What a stupid post.
1638,<|emo_disgust|> It could be worse. A lot of people may lose all their stuff when the bubble bursts.
1639,"<|emo_disgust|> You're using your privileged privilege to call other privileged people awful names? Ugh, I'm sensitive."
1642,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck yea!
1643,<|emo_disgust|> He has a prog rock album.. its awful
1644,<|emo_disgust|> That's an awful lot worse tbh
1645,<|emo_disgust|> This is the most hateful thing I've seen on Reddit this week. Truly disgusting.
1646,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] you are making me sick
1647,<|emo_disgust|> i can read in the comments that if the woman gets angry it makes me feel too irritable and angry too then they need to be taken away from me
1648,<|emo_disgust|> i feel offended and ashamed
1650,<|emo_disgust|> I have never been this disgusted in my life!
1651,<|emo_disgust|> It doesn't surprise me. His video game history is pretty cringe too.
1653,<|emo_disgust|> Why are you so fucking dumb
1654,<|emo_disgust|> I just wanna say here that you are fucking awesome. Fuck off with suggestions of what i should eat. Stay on the diet.
1655,<|emo_disgust|> They’re just greedy animals.
1656,<|emo_disgust|> This is really disgusting. Im so disgusted that you have posted it. Im now on facebook...dishonest reddit
1657,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck sake man
1658,<|emo_disgust|> This is a terrible tip. Please think before doing something like this.
1659,"<|emo_disgust|> The people supporting this were either idiots or didn't know the difference between spam and legit comments. Either way, you cant be neutral here. Thanks to everyone that pointed this out!"
1660,<|emo_disgust|> How is it weird to have fake ID cards (I've had this happen to me once)?
1661,<|emo_disgust|> I'm with you - it has to stink.
1662,<|emo_disgust|> That's horrible. I'm glad you did the right thing.
1663,<|emo_disgust|> This is so creepy and disgusting. I love our water and food but this video is making me sick.
1665,<|emo_disgust|> That was a weird way to spell [NAME]
1666,<|emo_disgust|> He was terrible
1667,<|emo_disgust|> Who the fuck thought he got away with saying things about which he should have been held accountable?
1669,<|emo_disgust|> When your favorite team's owner posts a picture of himself with a dorky sports figure in front of his corporate logo then it's business as usual?
1670,<|emo_disgust|> It's so fucking repulsive.
1671,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, look at thatass."
1672,"<|emo_disgust|> A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one"
1673,<|emo_disgust|> That’s disgusting. Apt.
1674,<|emo_disgust|> Those guys were beyond awful.
1675,<|emo_disgust|> The internet never disappoints.
1676,<|emo_disgust|> I think it's pretty safe to say that [NAME] is as evil as [NAME] and [NAME] on his album.
1677,"<|emo_disgust|> They're a bit cheaper than a bus fare in some parts of town, thanks to the continued presence of the London transport system."
1678,"<|emo_disgust|> If it's any comfort, there's a video called ""10 Things I Hate My Life For"""
1679,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fucking moron
1680,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], I hate Twitter"
1681,<|emo_disgust|> What a waste of plastic.
1682,<|emo_disgust|> It’s a lot of words and it is stupid.
1683,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a horny hag.
1684,<|emo_disgust|> Weird thread.
1685,<|emo_disgust|> This is the only job I've ever had to put a fucking accent
1686,<|emo_disgust|> Your company sucks.
1687,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, [NAME] is on fire!!! "
1688,<|emo_disgust|> I would of at least called the police but this is my worst fear right now.
1689,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn it, that is definitely something"
1690,<|emo_disgust|> I wonder where all the shit is
1691,<|emo_disgust|> This is so disgusting. Who made these changes? Who decided that was where the photos were?
1692,<|emo_disgust|> i have had feelings before about that and was still pissed off and kept saying how im wronged but i never had feelings for him back then
1693,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I love Chicago
1694,"<|emo_disgust|> Lol, thanks I hate it!"
1699,<|emo_disgust|> I dont fuck around
1701,<|emo_disgust|> It's a weird thing that people do. They'll usually say something between ‘oh yeah' and ‘ahhh well'.
1702,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, the guy is a Looter."
1703,<|emo_disgust|> I have no idea who those people are but I hate them.
1705,<|emo_disgust|> They are disgusting people inside and out
1706,<|emo_disgust|> It was a horrible decision and he knew it was a terrible decision. For his sake he should apologize.
1707,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch! My hear sank! Don’t do this to me!
1708,"<|emo_disgust|> Because what they did was disgusting. Reminds me of an old saying ""a chicken can get fat on its entire surface"""
1709,"<|emo_disgust|> In an ideal world all of society (including these few) would be on their best behavior, then drive their minivan on an isolated country road while smiling and shaking... Sounds a bit paranoid"
1710,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] looks fucking horrible
1711,<|emo_disgust|> So you're part of the reason for our terrible air quality. Smh
1712,"<|emo_disgust|> The one thing that every other parent on my block already does, is send their kid to school while they're sick. It's disgusting"
1713,<|emo_disgust|> Damn you [NAME]!
1714,<|emo_disgust|> Your not going to help your situation if you don't understand the basic issue. Get help
1715,<|emo_disgust|> What do you have to lose or gain by not backing a remainer? Your argument is pure identity politics.
1716,<|emo_disgust|> I think the real baddie is [NAME] in the fight scene where the glasses are falling off
1717,<|emo_disgust|> It's called a hug. You can see the inside if you care. It's very healing and comforting and comforting and warm and fuzzy.
1718,<|emo_disgust|> You would be so disgusted to look at it
1719,<|emo_disgust|> The new homes are hideous.
1720,<|emo_disgust|> This guy who gave the poor woman her shoes is a moron.
1721,<|emo_disgust|> Man I hate [NAME] so much
1722,<|emo_disgust|> You were literally born in the wrong body.
1723,<|emo_disgust|> This is an ugly fcking meme
1724,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that he is running for President is beyond fucking bollocks.
1725,<|emo_disgust|> My heart broke for that little girl.
1728,<|emo_disgust|> This is so sad. [NAME] can we please get some flowers and send a card to her??? It’s so cruel how society treats these amazing women. 
1729,<|emo_disgust|> i have a feeling this could turn into something nasty
1730,<|emo_disgust|> But I'm not ugly so what? Your saying I'm ugly because I'm a woman but how?!
1732,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling very extremely cranky and irritated
1733,<|emo_disgust|> Lol [NAME] can’t even handle this
1734,"<|emo_disgust|> I didn't know that. If anyone finds out my ex wife's relationship is cheating, that will forever be in my heart."
1735,<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck are you on?
1736,"<|emo_disgust|> If it sounds weird to you, you're weird."
1738,<|emo_disgust|> So disgusting. VWP
1739,<|emo_disgust|> Just don't call us bros.
1740,<|emo_disgust|> I miss the north hills bottom dollar :(
1741,"<|emo_disgust|> Not at all. I really can't imagine being this financially secure that I am, let alone having a wife who has a hidden stash of twenty dollar bills sitting at home."
1742,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah. That video is garbage.
1743,<|emo_disgust|> That’s not a fucking card
1745,<|emo_disgust|> What a useless tool.
1747,<|emo_disgust|> You’re an angry elf
1748,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] this is terrible
1749,<|emo_disgust|> It's absolutely disgusting that their government - which isrun by these utterly dangerous people- treats them worse than the average citizen.
1750,<|emo_disgust|> I can't make any money playing this game.
1751,<|emo_disgust|> I hate Twitter.
1753,"<|emo_disgust|> I mean, yeah, he was on a losing team and people were calling him the best QB that season, so..."
1754,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, you're right."
1755,<|emo_disgust|> That's sick!
1756,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has lost his shit on this morning’s episode ofThe Good Place.
1757,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like it s going to feel hostile
1758,<|emo_disgust|> Because it was an isolated incident? Unbelievable!
1760,"<|emo_disgust|> Don't you have a ""right"" or ""wrong"" response to it? The accusation is without merit. We all have ourologies."
1761,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so disgusted with myself for having a part of you that really wants to be there for me
1764,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking hate [NAME]
1765,<|emo_disgust|> It’s disgusting.
1766,<|emo_disgust|> It is hard to be angry in that situation.
1767,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a selfish prick.
1768,"<|emo_disgust|> What're you on about now? Your entire argument is based on emotion, which is incredibly dumb and yourself-oriented."
1769,<|emo_disgust|> What the heck does it matter? How is it that a country has to give up its sovereignty to another for a goddamn photo op?
1770,<|emo_disgust|> If this is what attracted him to you I am very angry.
1771,"<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit, what a load of crap!! He could have easily saved your life instead of killing /s"
1772,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, just to be fair I also have no issue with those whose parents are out and about, but damn."
1773,<|emo_disgust|> This is how democracy dies... With thunderous uprisings.
1775,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] just beat [NAME] and [NAME] and all their stars like nobody, but his name is [NAME]. "
1776,<|emo_disgust|> That poor janitor.
1777,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I was so hoping for that!!!!
1778,<|emo_disgust|> You’re disgusting.
1779,<|emo_disgust|> That's so horrifying. I can't imagine thinking that's even slightly palatable.
1780,"<|emo_disgust|> The one with [NAME] is pretty shit, but I'm not sure how they could have such bad rep..."
1781,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling really cranky but i think all this is really just an excuse
1782,"<|emo_disgust|> It's not the right sex, it's the wrong religion"
1783,"<|emo_disgust|> This is creepy and weird. Goodrhealthcare is a great thing, but this could have been much worse. "
1784,"<|emo_disgust|> No, seriously."
1785,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch! The roof of my mouth fell out.
1786,<|emo_disgust|> The most unluckiest of us all.
1787,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah [NAME] got lit up for that comment. I am very disturbed to learn that [NAME] has views similar to mine
1789,<|emo_disgust|> Oh so this is what they get for not voting for [NAME].
1790,<|emo_disgust|> That's so creepy. Someone call [NAME] and say that to your mom. Then she can see the red flags for sure.
1791,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that’s a real question
1792,<|emo_disgust|> You are an awful human being and should never beamed at or radiation from the sun ever again.
1793,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, that's pretty cringe."
1795,<|emo_disgust|> This is nasty NSFW
1796,<|emo_disgust|> I've never played a fighting game that involved a human fighter beingically tortured to death.
1797,<|emo_disgust|> Fear the T-1000.
1798,"<|emo_disgust|> It's pretty self-explanatory honestly. Some schools are worse than others, but I've found that going to school in the rain is miserable and having 5 teachers watching your back makes it a lot worse."
1800,"<|emo_disgust|> This is how it is with kids. If she tells you she wants to go to the bathroom, be her, but don't be surprised if she does. "
1801,<|emo_disgust|> He was just a little jealous of [NAME].
1802,<|emo_disgust|> I am really upset that she is even considering running for public office.
1803,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting. No one should act like that to you. I'm so sorry.
1804,"<|emo_disgust|> That's awful, bad for her and for her fans. It onlyows more reason to doubt [NAME] being a good sportsman"
1805,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] what an ass.
1806,<|emo_disgust|> I feel like I've been having a hell of a day
1807,<|emo_disgust|> He must not have actually been good at football lol
1808,"<|emo_disgust|> We don't even want to know if you are truthful, or not. That would be like asking the US to flag someone who flagrantly lies about 9/11"
1809,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that these people still exist is truly a disgrace.
1810,<|emo_disgust|> > [NAME] and I both love making up hate words I literally hate using them
1811,<|emo_disgust|> I can be convinced by one thing and it's all the time but seriously.
1812,<|emo_disgust|> Wow! Now that's some hate I've seen on this thread
1813,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Fucking online gaming community"" is the most condescending thing he says on the show right now."
1814,<|emo_disgust|> It really is a terrible policy.
1815,<|emo_disgust|> I don't know what that even means...just hears what you say...
1816,<|emo_disgust|> This is the most racist thing I've ever seen on Reddit.
1817,<|emo_disgust|> She's a pro-Assad piece of shit.
1818,<|emo_disgust|> Damn i love my city
1819,<|emo_disgust|> No. But the photo is creepy.
1820,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn kids are getting sassy over here!!
1821,<|emo_disgust|> I’m just gonna end here ‘sir you’re a freak
1822,<|emo_disgust|> What's the cringe?
1823,<|emo_disgust|> Lol I want to see a penis in his underwear
1824,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] that was a horrible call
1825,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a pro-Assad piece of shit.
1827,"<|emo_disgust|> No, what’s scary about it is the fact that the guy is a cop"
1828,"<|emo_disgust|> I was in the back of that bar, and I screamed."
1830,"<|emo_disgust|> I can't have sex with men and then say, ""I hate how I have sex with YOU"" as an excuse?"
1831,<|emo_disgust|> They look like dumpy hooker porn sites...
1832,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] you people are awful.
1833,"<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating. But yes, yes, yes!"
1834,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] I hate [NAME] too!
1835,<|emo_disgust|> My wife's family is the direct opposite of this. They are crazy about their food.
1836,<|emo_disgust|> Oh stop it!
1837,<|emo_disgust|> This one is a real pain in the ass.
1838,<|emo_disgust|> Not being racist is allowing [NAME] to make racist comments.
1839,"<|emo_disgust|> How'd it get that high up? That's a fucking Mountaintop, asshole. I'm from Arizona, and it's Mountaintopsexual."
1841,<|emo_disgust|> This was literally me! Kicking myself in the face while holding a sign that says [RELIGION] is wrong
1843,<|emo_disgust|> Wow so you're a nazi yourself huh?
1844,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst thing I've ever seen. Take my upvote.
1845,<|emo_disgust|> That's a bit rude..
1846,<|emo_disgust|> i hate how much i love it and am just so greedy for the time and energy this series has taken to author
1847,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh no, seriously"
1848,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you ask questions about my past and/or lack of past candor! /s
1849,"<|emo_disgust|> They're an angry bunch, huh?"
1850,"<|emo_disgust|> So much fake news,'ve lost count of the number of times it's been posted."
1851,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] makes me want to die
1853,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is fucking destroying Bama and I LOVE IT
1854,"<|emo_disgust|> I know, I know, I know...but [NAME] is a weird ass dude"
1855,<|emo_disgust|> Your mom is a fucking idiot.
1856,<|emo_disgust|> And this is a big fucking problem in Vancouver.
1857,"<|emo_disgust|> Not to be harsh, but did she say ""boyfriend""?"
1858,<|emo_disgust|> Damn. Just another day in hell I'm waiting for a [NAME].
1859,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], you scared motherfuker."
1860,<|emo_disgust|> I think the most telling evidence of her hypocrisy is her support for Israel. It's stunning.
1861,<|emo_disgust|> This is some of the worst passing I've ever seen.
1862,<|emo_disgust|> Damn you are right!
1863,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a cancer in our society and it's getting worse
1864,<|emo_disgust|> I can't imagine an old person saying that. It makes me uncomfortable.
1866,<|emo_disgust|> It could be much worse. A lot of people think he’s strong but he really just has no arms to spare.
1867,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't see how you didn't already know that. A lot of us here at /r/indieheads take issue with the label ""indie rock"" (indies are usually much worse)"
1868,<|emo_disgust|> Your a disgusting fuk
1869,<|emo_disgust|> It's a weird thing people say.
1870,"<|emo_disgust|> The comment ""watch as mommy goes to sleep"" is particularly cruel."
1871,<|emo_disgust|> >he's a disgusting human being. No. People are disgusting.
1872,<|emo_disgust|> Damn right! :'(
1874,<|emo_disgust|> Well just piss off
1875,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] this is horrible.
1876,<|emo_disgust|> This person should be outed to the world. How disgusting!
1877,<|emo_disgust|> The fuck?
1878,<|emo_disgust|> My 2 favorites 🔥
1879,<|emo_disgust|> How are you a fucking idiot you think you can get away with this
1880,<|emo_disgust|> I’m just gonna go ahead and call bullshit on the dude’s claim.
1881,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that is some vicious-ass sauce...
1883,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm not even sure [NAME] cares about his safety, let alone the fans safety."
1884,<|emo_disgust|> That damn wink snowser
1885,"<|emo_disgust|> He looks like he's taking a swing at some fencing posts, then swings at those posts, while being fence rushed."
1886,<|emo_disgust|> But she sounds hideous
1887,<|emo_disgust|> He's a weird.
1889,"<|emo_disgust|> That’s a terrible argument. First of all, you’re wrong about most of the things you’re saying - even the most basic needs to be respected. Get over yourself. "
1890,<|emo_disgust|> I can’t believe I just spent 2 minutes talking to this idiot. What a moron.
1891,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking cunt.
1892,<|emo_disgust|> Those pictures are disturbing. Reminds me of my mother.
1893,<|emo_disgust|> Those are some nasty ears.
1894,<|emo_disgust|> This made me cringe. Not the cringe I deserved lol.
1895,<|emo_disgust|> Why don't you fucking speak out?
1896,<|emo_disgust|> i feel agitated and irritable
1897,<|emo_disgust|> But I love to watch porn!
1898,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so pissed off right now
1899,<|emo_disgust|> You and your friends should get into better clothes.
1900,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck. This.
1901,<|emo_disgust|> This person is awful.
1902,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn it, your bed must stink in here"
1903,<|emo_disgust|> Aaaand everybody got diarrhea. Thanks dummy
1904,<|emo_disgust|> Damn it don’t snow in this part of the country :(
1905,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is so overpaid. Like 6k a month for a useless position.
1908,<|emo_disgust|> Not even all our foreign aid has gone to those countries either. What the hell.
1909,"<|emo_disgust|> How is she ""owing"" them? She's letting them do their thing."
1911,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking bollocking reply.
1912,<|emo_disgust|> I was there yesterday night! Weirdly enough I had a hard time believing that the roads were that bad.
1913,<|emo_disgust|> That’s awful. I can’t imagine for a moment that a rational human being would think that.
1915,<|emo_disgust|> Oh whoops haha
1916,"<|emo_disgust|> Just shut up, [NAME]!"
1917,<|emo_disgust|> Your parents probably fucked your horribly abusive aunt.
1918,"<|emo_disgust|> >I hate to be the bearer of bad news but I have no idea how it happened here. If those two people are in fact each other, I am not happy for you."
1919,<|emo_disgust|> People who support abortion can't be cruel. That's just sad. People will always want to kill babies.
1920,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a nasty mama goat.
1921,"<|emo_disgust|> There's a very high chance he would lie about it being from his throat, because it's so damn unlikely. "
1922,"<|emo_disgust|> I feel so fucking bad for her. She really should have asked twice, I don't know how she ignored [NAME] like that. "
1923,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing that can happen to someone is to have them overindulge in chocolate.
1924,<|emo_disgust|> Well I'm not the only one that feels this way but I suppose some women won’t have the balls to shame themselves so badly
1925,<|emo_disgust|> It was also recently revealed that [NAME] is actually a former smoker
1926,<|emo_disgust|> Why would they fake it? How would you fake it? It’s so obvious
1927,<|emo_disgust|> She had a baby. Who is to say that wasn’t also extremely public?
1928,"<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I'm with you, it's horrible."
1929,<|emo_disgust|> I hate when that happens.
1930,<|emo_disgust|> The way his body just folds after the final smack on his head is so Damn Funny. /s
1931,<|emo_disgust|> Don't you think she has a right to freedom of speech? We hate and fear her and want no part in her spreading our faith.
1932,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] why are you on twitter? We love your content you should do more of it
1933,<|emo_disgust|> He’s been a weird victim
1934,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm afraid you'll have to go with the ""I know a guy named [NAME]"" story."
1935,<|emo_disgust|> I just woke up drunk.
1936,<|emo_disgust|> That looks worse than a porno
1938,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit!!
1939,<|emo_disgust|> I really hated [NAME]
1941,<|emo_disgust|> In what fucking world has [NAME] gotten himself into this mess again? Even worse since he was the OC all the way through
1942,<|emo_disgust|> I'm here to tell you that is absolutely absolutely insane.
1943,"<|emo_disgust|> Those are all sorts of disgusting things to say, dude."
1944,<|emo_disgust|> i think about it i feel jealous as my favorite is next to half of the girls
1945,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like what i did was really wrong and i didn t think i would commit what some might call the crimes of abuse of power
1946,"<|emo_disgust|> She is a horrible person, and she has a history of making terrible decisions. :("
1947,<|emo_disgust|> Weird how they're actually the worst THoggs
1948,<|emo_disgust|> I like you but this is stupid
1950,<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting. This is the kind of stuff that made me leave the show.
1951,<|emo_disgust|> He must really hate� people.
1952,<|emo_disgust|> i do not feel greedy and self indulgent
1953,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I didn't know that!
1954,<|emo_disgust|> Damn what a waste of plastic.
1955,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn we need a [NAME] sub
1958,<|emo_disgust|> You are disturbed.
1959,<|emo_disgust|> My friend and I spent $600+ on a table and chairs at a bar in downtown St Louis. The worst part is we had a really nice table and chair at home!
1960,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] you dirty abo
1961,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I hope you and everyone else can avoid that.
1962,"<|emo_disgust|> He's the one with all the money, the real heroes are probably his wife's (orgy of gifts) or his daughter's (sick) parents"
1965,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't care what anyone says about me, I love prog metal."
1966,<|emo_disgust|> The best part is he wasn't wrong...
1967,<|emo_disgust|> What the heck?!
1968,<|emo_disgust|> Well this is worrying.
1971,<|emo_disgust|> i feel cold most of the time
1972,<|emo_disgust|> The fact [NAME] and [NAME] are playing for the same team gives me anxiety...
1973,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you assume my mortality! >:O
1974,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, just so you don't get the wrong idea, let me add that this is a joke that's been around for some time now."
1975,<|emo_disgust|> Well I guess he was just being a jerk or something 😂
1976,<|emo_disgust|> If they think I'll ever become a [NAME] they should give me another chance.
1977,<|emo_disgust|> She's just a dumb bitch
1978,<|emo_disgust|> Oh what a shame. I’d love to hear more about her and how she ended up.
1979,<|emo_disgust|> The best is getting a fake order number or text from her. It’s so infuriating
1980,<|emo_disgust|> This is creepy and weird. I feel betrayed that anyone would do something like this.
1981,"<|emo_disgust|> The thing about being a [RELIGION] apologist is that even if you are sincere about it, there are plenty of idiots out there that would go even further."
1982,"<|emo_disgust|> Fuck this team, first rounders a joke"
1983,"<|emo_disgust|> If your friends got into one of those, you have to talk to them to make sure they wont do it again...."
1984,<|emo_disgust|> They hate [NAME].
1985,"<|emo_disgust|> My boyfriend doesn't eat out that much, but my parents were extremely stingy when it came to government programs."
1986,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing worse than this is a company that actually makes money from selling its services rather than being an honest and neutral party.
1988,"<|emo_disgust|> I’m not crying, you're crying"
1989,"<|emo_disgust|> If you think it's scary that a child could grow up thinking that 9/11 was an inside job, you're pretty pathetic. "
1990,<|emo_disgust|> He was very rude to me
1991,<|emo_disgust|> It’s a bit worrying that he’s not going to the Bengals or Lions.... either of them would be a worse offering for him
1992,"<|emo_disgust|> Because he said something dumb, you wanna make a name for yourself?"
1994,<|emo_disgust|> The only difference is your username. You're using a fake Reddit handle to pretend to be a serious redditor and you're disgusted at how awful it is.
1995,<|emo_disgust|> The main reason I left is the art style and character designs. These are bad.
1996,"<|emo_disgust|> This is almost certainly a hate sub. Is there any way that we can contribute to this? If we are, we need to do it!"
1997,<|emo_disgust|> It's so obnoxious.
1998,<|emo_disgust|> I agree witholly if this was a franchise of any sort. Just a fan movie for kids. And I like the cast
1999,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a moron, you should probably move to the US"
2000,<|emo_disgust|> She's a horrible person but for some reason people here accept her.
2001,<|emo_disgust|> i felt so stressed out while he slept but he didnt care so much
2002,<|emo_disgust|> This comment killed me. RIP in pieces.
2003,<|emo_disgust|> I'd sooner be murdered than go to a bank.
2005,<|emo_disgust|> That's even worse honestly
2006,"<|emo_disgust|> Why? What's wrong with people? It's their fault for being ignorant,istic,istic,istic!!!"
2007,<|emo_disgust|> Damn. It. Almost. Wasn't on the page.
2008,<|emo_disgust|> It's actually amazing how many people still use old methods to donate.
2009,<|emo_disgust|> I don't care if their a mixture of people from different walks of life...idk the point.
2010,<|emo_disgust|> The third period began with what was essentially a brutal check from the visiting team and ended with some heckin' celebrating by the home team
2011,<|emo_disgust|> I’m gonna be rude if I say no.
2012,<|emo_disgust|> It's honestly just a meme.
2013,<|emo_disgust|> Well if it is a video game then... damn does it suck. My friends though and I love Street Fighter V.
2014,<|emo_disgust|> Now look what you have done.
2015,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a cancer in our society...he should be roundly punished for his immoral activities
2017,<|emo_disgust|> That's pretty lewd. What did he do? Did he give the card?
2019,<|emo_disgust|> I honestly miss him and think he still has a future in SC2 but he has become so toxic and arrogant lately
2020,<|emo_disgust|> That was a vicious goal. No doubt in my mind it was intentional but it’s just a guy taking a big hit from [NAME].
2022,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] I should've kept my distance and left
2024,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah because his character has this weird relationship with a 16 year old boy. Just weird.
2025,"<|emo_disgust|> The fact that it's ""shitposting"" is just mind boggling. They could have just called it a satire"
2026,<|emo_disgust|> Well at least he'll have some money to play with...
2027,<|emo_disgust|> There’s a difference between hating one group and being racist.
2028,<|emo_disgust|> That's a huge fucking lie.
2029,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] isn't a horrible guy. He's just a shitty owner.
2030,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] should not have made it through, that pass was awful"
2031,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has been a pleasant surprise
2032,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I stopped watching. :( Ugh
2034,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that these are all women gives me anxiety.
2036,<|emo_disgust|> What a disgusting character.
2038,<|emo_disgust|> That's an obnoxious lot.
2039,<|emo_disgust|> Don't be an asshole
2041,<|emo_disgust|> I still can't believe people who play are actually using their hands for that shit
2042,<|emo_disgust|> You're so ugly even tears wont show up near you
2043,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, I’d love to tell you that, but I’m stupid as hell. "
2044,<|emo_disgust|> It’s weird because I usually don’t see it but you’re right. What I do see is you probably didn’t read it because what you said wasn’t wrong. And it’s one of my biggest pet peeves. I’m sorry.
2045,<|emo_disgust|> That was way more abuse than a slap on the hand.inks.
2046,<|emo_disgust|> No idea what she said. Go figure. She isn't president
2047,<|emo_disgust|> Wow! I've never seen such bad grammar
2048,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking hell they're bringing on all the giants
2049,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] a fucking idiot...
2050,<|emo_disgust|> Shut your mouth libtard you are being unkind to the british people
2051,<|emo_disgust|> The only way to stop the flow of drugs on the streets is to ban them all.
2052,"<|emo_disgust|> >i see you're using a combination of both, yeah? I'm a moron."
2053,"<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit, that was fucking bad..."
2054,<|emo_disgust|> i feel very cold when i get worked up over anything
2055,"<|emo_disgust|> >I hate being summed up in positive terms often enough. Your experience in healthcare was what made you someone special, [NAME]"
2056,<|emo_disgust|> I'm going to leave you with that picture. I'm so sad you have to go through this.
2057,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] sucks.
2058,<|emo_disgust|> Your disgusting amount of Sesame oil mixture is disgusting!
2059,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, we could be oil rich yet still have stable, predictable politics."
2062,<|emo_disgust|> This is fucking disgusting.
2063,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that she's a Democratic Leader should tell you all you need to know about her.
2064,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] you really fucked up last night, now blame myself for all your misbehavior and for allowing it to happen. "
2065,"<|emo_disgust|> ""We really are a bizarre and wonderful people and I'm glad you're a part of that."" -Oscar Wilde"
2066,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you comment on something so terrible as this
2068,<|emo_disgust|> So....the media is going to pretend this guy didn't die?
2069,<|emo_disgust|> She has an ugly BPD twin
2070,<|emo_disgust|> You're racist.
2071,"<|emo_disgust|> A couple things: Fuck the dodgers, fuck the Angels, fuck [NAME] "
2073,<|emo_disgust|> That's... pretty lewd actually.
2075,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is when it's the result of someone being annoyed by something.
2076,<|emo_disgust|> The amount of hypocrisy and racism the left puts forward is incredible.
2077,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I'm sorry your friend didn't want to play.
2079,<|emo_disgust|> This picture pisses me off.
2081,"<|emo_disgust|> That's not an argument, it's a SHITpost"
2084,<|emo_disgust|> i feel kind of stupid
2085,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a pro-Assad piece of shit.
2086,<|emo_disgust|> Because it's awful.
2087,<|emo_disgust|> i feel very selfish now as i look back on it
2088,<|emo_disgust|> What a moronic thing to say.
2090,<|emo_disgust|> He’s a moron. Stop trying to pretend otherwise. I’ve seen enough and it’s definitely not a trait you’re trying to hide.
2091,<|emo_disgust|> The least awful thing the Netflix documentary did was to air a few minutes without any sound. I felt so disappointed.
2092,<|emo_disgust|> That's your guess as to why people don't want to see your penis.
2093,<|emo_disgust|> What a cruelly poetic fact
2094,<|emo_disgust|> That's the worst hat he ever wore.
2095,<|emo_disgust|> You're a terrible human being.
2096,"<|emo_disgust|> In that case, don't blame us."
2097,<|emo_disgust|> She's a horrible human being.
2098,<|emo_disgust|> Weirdly enough this guy just got banned from /r/television subreddit for posting this
2099,<|emo_disgust|> Lol what a fucking n
2100,<|emo_disgust|> Wow what a bummer. The Better business bureau is doing an investigation into his website and is looking into all of this.
2101,<|emo_disgust|> She's a horrible person.
2102,<|emo_disgust|> There’s no way I didn’t know [NAME] was on the Bengals books as an OC. This should be eye opening.
2103,<|emo_disgust|> That was brutal. Loved it
2104,<|emo_disgust|> I know a dozen local school administrators. All of them would love her but are terrified of what her Senate primary opponent might do to the district. 
2105,<|emo_disgust|> What the hell
2106,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]: “GOD DAMN YOU”...and he was almost immediately replaced by [NAME]
2107,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I'm just a fan of his/her hockey"" ""i know hockey is a hard game but it's not what you're trying to say"""
2108,<|emo_disgust|> They didn’t go for broke there.
2109,<|emo_disgust|> I'm a size queen. I size 21 on regular basis and I've never felt that sizequeasy.
2110,<|emo_disgust|> Weird how once-ugly people can suddenly become stars for TV?
2111,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you. I have a friend in Hanoi
2112,<|emo_disgust|> Weird. He’s always seemed like a happy kid. Seems a bit weird.
2114,"<|emo_disgust|> You do, I like your game. I wish you were here. The memories are too bad to leave"
2115,"<|emo_disgust|> I was thinking I’d get pissed off about this, then changed my mind"
2116,<|emo_disgust|> My favorite thing is his girlfriend
2117,<|emo_disgust|> My god he's actually attractive.
2118,<|emo_disgust|> I had the worst premonition ever. I just remember falling out of my chair and never coming back.
2120,<|emo_disgust|> You can find the real deal but it's a lot further. Stay away from places with troubled pasts.
2121,<|emo_disgust|> There are more disgusting places in the world than this.
2122,<|emo_disgust|> Just piss off
2123,<|emo_disgust|> It’s so fucking creepy
2124,<|emo_disgust|> No its not!
2125,<|emo_disgust|> I've seen that video a number of times. It's actually awful.
2126,"<|emo_disgust|> In the third degree, you do commit a felony. You can go to jail for up to five years."
2127,<|emo_disgust|> Why would anyone hate a coffee shop anyway. People have a *right* to their opinion.
2128,<|emo_disgust|> This is so disgusting even [NAME] has to say it
2129,<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting.
2130,<|emo_disgust|> You’re an awful human being.
2131,<|emo_disgust|> Damn. I'm sorry.
2132,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is getting worse, I'm actually sick to my stomach from this"
2133,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking hate [NAME]..
2134,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] looks terrible all together
2135,<|emo_disgust|> Oh my gooooood
2136,"<|emo_disgust|> No, you're right! I hate all of them. "
2137,<|emo_disgust|> I have a weird feeling he hates his dad.
2138,"<|emo_disgust|> He’s not an acceptable fit, the Wizards need a 3 point shooting guard and this is the worst offer sheet they could get"
2140,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is back, and worse. The new skin looks awful."
2141,<|emo_disgust|> If you don’t like [NAME] you’re an idiot
2142,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you not find domestic abuse funny! /s
2143,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Fuck it I'll steal this"""
2144,<|emo_disgust|> >How many different ways could it possibly be?! One of the worst franchises of all time combined with an under appreciated team!
2145,"<|emo_disgust|> There is a weird twist. You get to be a ""geriatrician"" if you're older than 70."
2146,<|emo_disgust|> Awe! Poor cat!
2147,"<|emo_disgust|> The whole ""muricans are here because the map is fucked"" thing is ridiculous."
2148,<|emo_disgust|> I hope you're still in high school too. Can't imagine now being a kid. Worst experience of my life.
2149,"<|emo_disgust|> This is how all fascism comes across to me. Brutal, awful, but accurate."
2150,<|emo_disgust|> Damn liberals!
2151,<|emo_disgust|> You're creepy
2152,<|emo_disgust|> This post should be removed for breaking rule 3. It is not information that should be shared.
2153,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you.
2154,<|emo_disgust|> She’s disgusting.
2155,<|emo_disgust|> The dude is in his late 30s. He probably isn't in much of a good place mentally at this point
2156,"<|emo_disgust|> You'd think they hated him for that, damnit. "
2157,<|emo_disgust|> Because it's cruel.
2158,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME], [NAME], what are you trying to steal?"
2160,<|emo_disgust|> It's like a fucking fruit bat.
2161,<|emo_disgust|> >I hate that I love it 
2163,<|emo_disgust|> Because men are propertyless and women have all the votes. Mine don't.
2164,<|emo_disgust|> How dare she ask where his penis is? It's on his shirt!
2165,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit.
2166,<|emo_disgust|> But why are we here to shame them? We've already had enough of that already.
2168,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I'm so hungry now.
2169,<|emo_disgust|> i was feeling especially rude to the lady sitting next to me
2170,<|emo_disgust|> Wow. That’s awful. I’m so sorry.
2172,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that they're complaining about racism is pretty disturbing.
2173,"<|emo_disgust|> It's a big concern to me of course, but the problem for the government is even more simple. It's not about collection vs. wiretapping, rather it's abuse vs. intelligence gathering"
2174,"<|emo_disgust|> Because they're all terrified of the same thing, and want to pretend everything is perfect because their perfection is. Fuck everything so deeply that trying to pretend everything is perfect is a waste of time."
2176,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, fuck."
2177,<|emo_disgust|> They’re all pretty bad if you’re young.
2178,<|emo_disgust|> But the sunrises and sunsets on this planet are so beautiful
2179,<|emo_disgust|> They're scared of press
2180,<|emo_disgust|> My fucking girlfriend does this and gets all hot headed and does bizarre things with herself.
2181,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird. Weird, just weird. WTF is wrong with people."
2182,"<|emo_disgust|> This is what I'm feeling right now, I'm so, so sad. "
2184,<|emo_disgust|> i was not feeling angry and upset but i was not sure what my next step would be or what i should do next
2185,"<|emo_disgust|> He still won’t answer, because he is afraid of repercussions. This is how it works there.."
2187,<|emo_disgust|> She's going to be so embarrassed to talk about it.
2189,"<|emo_disgust|> No, no, she's just a horrible human being. I hate how much I love her "
2190,<|emo_disgust|> That's just ignorant. Kids would be far more intelligent for not learning a dozen sciences at school.
2191,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, it sort of sucks now."
2192,<|emo_disgust|> There's something wrong with you.
2193,<|emo_disgust|> We are so good on Sunday
2195,<|emo_disgust|> When it happens so often...my heart is devastated.
2196,<|emo_disgust|> Wow those fingers... they must smell terrible.
2197,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] are getting shat on
2198,<|emo_disgust|> The way you're phrasing it is an insult.
2199,<|emo_disgust|> I’m with you. This game does need an investigation.
2200,"<|emo_disgust|> And then they were like ""oh yeah well if you don't like the new rules we have you can leave"" until he actually did something awful"
2201,<|emo_disgust|> Oh fuck off already.
2202,<|emo_disgust|> That's the main reason why I hated them so much. The second was their awful misuse of Science.
2203,<|emo_disgust|> Well now I hate them even more!
2204,<|emo_disgust|> What's that? A napkin? [NAME] didn't napkin it was a napkin!
2205,<|emo_disgust|> What is hate?
2208,<|emo_disgust|> No. Is it wrong that I feel the need to know why we should care?
2209,"<|emo_disgust|> Thats absolutely disgusting. I can’t imagine thinking that is even remotely okay, let alone condoning such disgusting behavior."
2210,<|emo_disgust|> We are all [NAME]holes
2211,<|emo_disgust|> It’s ugly. I really hope you’re ok. I’m so sorry this happened to you.
2212,<|emo_disgust|> This is very disturbing. Very creepy.
2213,<|emo_disgust|> Oh my fuck I didn't realize they were the same people.
2214,"<|emo_disgust|> No I dont want my kids to grow up thinking ""I have a gun and a brain"""
2215,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is when people assume things because they don't know any better.
2216,<|emo_disgust|> Man I hate this too!
2217,<|emo_disgust|> i want to give up on the relationship but i feel like a little distracted from the relationship
2218,<|emo_disgust|> No it's been a record breaking year for the number of babies born each year... birthrate is down
2219,<|emo_disgust|> Damn is it really?!?!
2220,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm pregnant! ""How dare you?!"" I hate it."
2221,<|emo_disgust|> Well I hate when I see it.
2222,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that you're not even willing to make yourself available for questioning is really disturbing.
2223,<|emo_disgust|> Man I hate that ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss.
2224,<|emo_disgust|> I hope there is a special place in Hell for these people.
2225,"<|emo_disgust|> If we are serious about a return to the top flight, I'd be thinking more around the £70 mark, a decent price for a top class team"
2226,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is so wrong and disgusting if you hate him so hard, you're a horrible person. Stop validating your own hate. "
2227,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a horrible democrat
2228,"<|emo_disgust|> This is actually worse than the original. For social norms, this is terrible. "
2229,<|emo_disgust|> The guy just needs to get off the phone and apologize. If his apologies don't change his behavior... I’m done.
2230,<|emo_disgust|> She’s just a dumbass lol she’s such a dumbass
2231,<|emo_disgust|> You're not a bad person by saying those things.
2232,<|emo_disgust|> i feel frustrated more and more and finally at the point where it could be resolved and the pain not felt as much
2233,<|emo_disgust|> It's worse than you think. You could get charged under the false allegations.
2234,"<|emo_disgust|> This person should be outed to the world, even to the state. What a reckless pos"
2235,<|emo_disgust|> I'm just saying don't act shocked if you see a 3rd party political party politician on the show.
2236,<|emo_disgust|> Your mental gymnastics are so amazing. It's literally mind boggling.
2237,<|emo_disgust|> And then there's you're still single. This is kinda sad
2238,"<|emo_disgust|> Not quite what I meant! I was just a bit annoyed that your company caters to the ""old rich"" crowd."
2239,<|emo_disgust|> i was feeling quite annoyed and frustrated that day
2240,<|emo_disgust|> You don't know what communism is.
2241,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah. The whole ""don't be ugly"" part just sucks."
2242,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is so creepy
2243,"<|emo_disgust|> You're a disgusting piece, a piece of shit and an even worse human being."
2245,<|emo_disgust|> This is horrible... I'm so sorry. Your parents must be rock stars.
2246,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] looked so stupid in that video
2247,<|emo_disgust|> You're so ugly even tears wont show up near you anymore
2248,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is such a heartless piece of shit..
2250,<|emo_disgust|> That was truly disgusting. VWP
2251,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] the scumbag...
2252,"<|emo_disgust|> You don't have to do anything to get it and its really not that hard to ignoring it. Just don't be the sad, lonely person that constantly has to pick yourself up and try for what matters anyway."
2253,<|emo_disgust|> That shit got me rolling LMFAO
2254,<|emo_disgust|> He said this was against his will and he will never again put anything like that in my mouth. I'm devastated.
2255,<|emo_disgust|> I've had worse.
2256,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] can’t drink!
2257,<|emo_disgust|> Whoa my opinion. I’m a lot more supportive towards them than I was pre season.
2258,<|emo_disgust|> You are fucking disgusting
2259,"<|emo_disgust|> No, I have never said this, but I think I’m going to have to take your upvote. "
2260,<|emo_disgust|> That's what I thought too! I was worried the kid was going to turn into a octopus if he kept getting bigger.
2261,<|emo_disgust|> What the actual fuck?
2262,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damnit, do your research. There's no ""news"" to report. Fuck reddit in general"
2263,"<|emo_disgust|> Those women are making an awful lot of noise right now because they feel like their voices can't be heard, not least because of how easily laughed off as ridiculous and offensive they are by the men around them."
2265,<|emo_disgust|> That's the worst potential crossover point...
2266,<|emo_disgust|> What a moronic idea.
2267,<|emo_disgust|> You are obviously disgusting.
2268,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I have trust issues
2269,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is so pathetic.
2270,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is when the ads are literally window dressing. Makes me want to die
2271,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm not waiting around for ""it'll happen eventually"" but if it ever does, I'm going to be pissed."
2272,<|emo_disgust|> This is just sad. The way she looks in this pic just screams at you to get off my property
2273,<|emo_disgust|> What a weird way to get laid
2274,<|emo_disgust|> What a complete and utter bullshit tbh
2275,<|emo_disgust|> That damn wink slayed me. Swoon that lethargic ass bastard.
2276,"<|emo_disgust|> This is a horrible idea. He said, ""I did not want this deal because it doesn't add to the overall value of the deal."" What a bad idea. "
2277,<|emo_disgust|> In the worst way.
2278,<|emo_disgust|> What a weird way to ask the age of a kid.
2279,<|emo_disgust|> My [NAME] I'm crying.
2280,<|emo_disgust|> She’s 30. I’m 30. What can I say.
2281,<|emo_disgust|> And that wig..this fucking face
2282,<|emo_disgust|> Don't mention [NAME] we get it.
2283,<|emo_disgust|> i just don t feel insulted anymore when i say something good
2284,<|emo_disgust|> I hated [NAME] when he worked forggles at home as a kid but he is now a really good friend and I wish him best of luck in the new job
2285,<|emo_disgust|> I have seen this one more times than I care to admit...it's horrible.
2286,<|emo_disgust|> It's hard to be a man in a world that treats women like second class citizens.
2287,<|emo_disgust|> i really feel i was wronged and am sorry and am beginning to forgive
2289,<|emo_disgust|> Oh man that was a missed opportunity
2290,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking idiotic thing to say.
2291,<|emo_disgust|> No. Shut up and stop trolling.
2292,"<|emo_disgust|> It was probably a lot worse than we thought. All the windows were smashed, and the bathrooms were locked."
2293,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit
2294,<|emo_disgust|> You'll be a sad old man when you die.
2295,"<|emo_disgust|> There are also people that genuinely have no idea what's going on, even when it's coming up. "
2296,<|emo_disgust|> This is so disturbing to think about.
2297,<|emo_disgust|> I have no idea what you're on about but I fucking love your sense of irony so damn bad xD
2298,<|emo_disgust|> What is worst is how much he loves the attention. He'll come home and scream at you like a normal toddler
2299,<|emo_disgust|> You don't support it and you don't know what you are talking about.
2300,<|emo_disgust|> There could be a lot of us [NAME] in here.
2301,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a monster.
2302,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, that lousy Gresham ad"
2303,<|emo_disgust|> Lol your an asshole there.
2305,<|emo_disgust|> I was wrong and I'm hurt
2306,<|emo_disgust|> Just be a man and stop being so opinionated and mouthy about everything haha
2307,<|emo_disgust|> I am appalled that you choose to ignore the science of climate change.
2309,<|emo_disgust|> Oh you mean [NAME]
2310,<|emo_disgust|> He's still only 25. I've had the worst luck with pro bono lawyers.
2311,<|emo_disgust|> I hate that she thought this was funny. She should've said “oh yeah that’s what I was trying to say” instead of “oh this is weird” 
2312,"<|emo_disgust|> I actually really enjoyeducci in the first act, but the musicality and direction in the second half really started to bother me. "
2314,<|emo_disgust|> I was literally flabbergasted when it came out that [NAME] is straight up horrible
2315,"<|emo_disgust|> In the words of [NAME], ""Tiny"" is the worst. "
2316,"<|emo_disgust|> It's weird, but yes, no."
2317,<|emo_disgust|> It’s a weird thing people do
2318,<|emo_disgust|> This is my favorite wild memory
2319,"<|emo_disgust|> What a crap job, I’d be screaming my damn head off. "
2320,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, goodness gracious gracious gracious, now is a very bad time for any band to release a video."
2321,<|emo_disgust|> The only reason I'll still go to a Chili's after that is because I have a bag of mayo left over from a last night's hamburger.
2322,<|emo_disgust|> I would really be curious what caused [NAME] to become this way
2323,<|emo_disgust|> Just remember I love you
2324,<|emo_disgust|> This is a bad post omg
2325,<|emo_disgust|> That was brutal. Losing 6-0 is humbling.
2326,<|emo_disgust|> Oh wow. Never thought of that. Thanks.
2327,<|emo_disgust|> Man I'm sorry I imagine that was awful. Man I was wronged.
2328,<|emo_disgust|> How absolutely disgusting.
2329,<|emo_disgust|> This isn't even mostly [NAME] it's a fucking Delmonico. [NAME] is fucking useless at this
2330,<|emo_disgust|> Those subs... wtf
2331,<|emo_disgust|> He can just shut off his internet for the day while he recants his views
2332,<|emo_disgust|> That's one creepy sock Man
2333,<|emo_disgust|> That damn wink slayed me. Swoon so hard!
2335,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that you think like this is pretty frightening.
2336,<|emo_disgust|> My mom is from Jersey. I feel so bad for her. I'm from Florida. I hate it here.
2339,<|emo_disgust|> You have a horrible understanding of punctuation!
2341,<|emo_disgust|> I’m so jealous I live in Florida
2342,<|emo_disgust|> They're worse than the [NAME] people because they will try to take advantage of you! They're horrible people. :(
2343,"<|emo_disgust|> Whoa, nevermind. I feel for you."
2344,"<|emo_disgust|> You don't get to tell someone what ""happened"" in the past."
2345,<|emo_disgust|> That [NAME] guy knows his shit when he mouth
2346,<|emo_disgust|> And the new ones are hideous looking
2347,<|emo_disgust|> And I thought I was alone! But oh man are there others 
2348,<|emo_disgust|> Holy fuck I needed that!
2349,"<|emo_disgust|> No, that’s not a bad sketch. That was really bad. "
2350,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Gee he is a good sport about it at home, 'bout to break balls around a big rock on a rainy day."""
2351,<|emo_disgust|> It’s like [NAME] and [NAME] with the same hair.
2352,<|emo_disgust|> Just because someone doesn't understand how taxes work. They are so dumb.
2354,<|emo_disgust|> And even worse after 30 years!
2355,<|emo_disgust|> Not true. There are racists who are too stupid to admit they are racists.
2356,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] fucking [NAME].
2357,<|emo_disgust|> You are such a pathetic human being.
2359,<|emo_disgust|> It’s even worse when the jobs are in construction. That’s the other jobs I’m talking about
2360,<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting. I would immediately block the individual from his / Their subreddit.
2362,"<|emo_disgust|> You have to find the right woman, period."
2363,<|emo_disgust|> He must really hate taking the blame for things because he acts like it’s his fault.
2364,<|emo_disgust|> Your life is miserable.
2365,"<|emo_disgust|> That’s awful, good to know she was okay."
2367,<|emo_disgust|> Oh...yuck
2368,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] are bad because I like them
2369,"<|emo_disgust|> And so is my wife. She's taking our kids, apparently. She can’t find any other woman to do it with."
2370,<|emo_disgust|> Lol you are fucking retarded
2371,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is being on a 2 train at rush hour and an impatient waiting conductor trying to force his hand on you to board the train.
2372,<|emo_disgust|> But that's still a shitty wage
2373,"<|emo_disgust|> We are the masters of evil, and we will use it against you the world over"
2374,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting... please make more.
2375,<|emo_disgust|> That’s a weird way of spelling Disenchanted
2376,<|emo_disgust|> They’re the dumbest guys in the fuckin class.
2377,<|emo_disgust|> That’s awful. Well said. :(
2378,<|emo_disgust|> Not to mention that we need a president to get that job done and be able to take a vacation when he wants.
2379,<|emo_disgust|> Damn. I feel like I live in another country.
2380,<|emo_disgust|> So obnoxious.
2381,<|emo_disgust|> They’re trying to say his girlfriend's 15 too!
2382,<|emo_disgust|> I was just wondering if anyone else was getting brigaded by a well known social media personality. I'm sure it's not the same thing I'm hearing
2384,<|emo_disgust|> Your comments are disgusting. No one should have to deal with your disgusting comments.
2385,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so insecure with my self esteem
2386,<|emo_disgust|> That [NAME] was a fucking monster...
2387,<|emo_disgust|> Not good news from any of that though. Congrats on the divorce though! Poor guy!
2388,<|emo_disgust|> Damn. Damn. Damn
2389,<|emo_disgust|> If you really are a sadist then you're pretty much the worst human being alive.
2390,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit he hit him hard
2391,<|emo_disgust|> The first sentence is pretty bad.
2392,<|emo_disgust|> Now you know there is no such thing as a badger in New Zealand.
2393,<|emo_disgust|> But the real bad beat!
2394,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh no, not what I meant at all"
2395,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn people
2396,<|emo_disgust|> It could get really ugly
2397,<|emo_disgust|> What kind of idiot would go against [NAME] like that?
2399,<|emo_disgust|> Lol. Dictionaries are bad.
2400,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm not saying to avoid them at all costs! Just don't expect much in the way of a handfasting friendly attitude, you will be disappointed."
2402,<|emo_disgust|> Why would you go there. It's a fucking picturesque spot.
2403,<|emo_disgust|> So if something happens to your body doesn't expect you to have health problems the whole time.
2404,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh wow, your dad is awful"
2405,<|emo_disgust|> Well you have to say they're probably getting a bit far fetched.
2408,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so pissed off that my best friend is actually this hateful
2409,"<|emo_disgust|> He really needed to get that free throw shooting under control, it was incredible."
2412,<|emo_disgust|> Your mom is a fucking horrible human being.
2413,"<|emo_disgust|> The one I used a year ago, horrible."
2414,<|emo_disgust|> Those are ugly af :(
2415,<|emo_disgust|> I really like this
2416,<|emo_disgust|> So we should start deporting all of those illegal workers back to their countries?
2417,<|emo_disgust|> The reason why [NAME] has become such a household name is because he is so inconsistent.
2418,<|emo_disgust|> i feel rude for saying that
2419,<|emo_disgust|> This is a really horrible dissection of what exactly goes on in the brain of a killer
2420,<|emo_disgust|> That’s not a fucking card?!
2421,<|emo_disgust|> Oh fuck off already. The hat was a damn good buy.
2422,<|emo_disgust|> I’m tired of reading negative articles about us. Especially the article about us that has absolutely nothing to do with us.
2423,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck my life
2424,<|emo_disgust|> Lol [NAME] what did I just read
2426,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, there you go I was just correct. It would be a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one."
2427,<|emo_disgust|> It’s so cringy!
2428,<|emo_disgust|> I like the way the [NAME] voice actor portrayal of him sounds!!
2429,<|emo_disgust|> i feel more frustrated that i have to do it on my own than anyone but somehow its more acceptable to just not ask
2430,"<|emo_disgust|> She's still a bad defending player, but I think it's pretty good."
2431,"<|emo_disgust|> It looks like a horrible disambiguation, so to speak, for ""dismember""."
2432,"<|emo_disgust|> It is weird, doesn't it? In England lots of people say “beds up” but here it‘s “beds down”"
2433,<|emo_disgust|> i woke up this morning feeling stressed a lot because i didnt know what i was going to tell my family
2434,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like it wasnt the fault of others to do things and i havent been bothered by that either way
2435,<|emo_disgust|> I’m about to be extremely boring
2436,<|emo_disgust|> This hurts to watch
2437,"<|emo_disgust|> That's the one place where we have decent service. Not that there isn't worse, but there's not that many."
2438,<|emo_disgust|> That was the worst power play I've ever seen
2439,"<|emo_disgust|> That's just awful. I hate Twitter and I hate Facebook, I get it."
2440,<|emo_disgust|> Your so much worse then [NAME]
2441,"<|emo_disgust|> I can't stand [NAME], but I'm willing to buy him a beer and watch him kick a shit ball through a fucking hole."
2442,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, you are quite the romantic..."
2443,"<|emo_disgust|> I was feeling a tad offended that [NAME] was even thinking along those lines. He could have simply said ""fuck off"""
2444,"<|emo_disgust|> You're going to hate it soon. The long, miserable story is in the works."
2445,<|emo_disgust|> What a sickening lack of common sense.
2448,<|emo_disgust|> >he's a liar cuz he doesn't admit to being a liar even when his evidence doesn't comport with it.
2449,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow what a bummer, good riddance to awful rubbish."
2451,<|emo_disgust|> My least favorite is the one where [NAME] gets distracted by a tree
2453,<|emo_disgust|> Omg this picture is the worst thing I've seen today
2454,<|emo_disgust|> That’s a really low bar. I’m honestly afraid I will never be able to meet that bar.
2455,<|emo_disgust|> I hate it when mom and dad fight.
2456,<|emo_disgust|> When you go on an event and the guest speaker is half naked
2457,<|emo_disgust|> That is a weird way to spell Disenchanted
2458,<|emo_disgust|> What a cruel and unusual law that is. I am so very disturbed by it.
2459,"<|emo_disgust|> You don't have to wait to be stopped, you just have to stop. "
2460,<|emo_disgust|> Those are bulgy balls!
2461,"<|emo_disgust|> If you are not of or against IS, you are a bigot. That is the crux of your argument."
2462,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] why all the hate?
2463,<|emo_disgust|> i don t want them to have an easy job and it feels frustrating being this way so often
2464,<|emo_disgust|> I feel like its a girl calling her a “fucking idiot” and not being submissive as she is. What a bitch.
2465,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, you were on a mobile site too, yeh?"
2466,<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck is [NAME] doing in a Jersey sweater? I've got to be at work right now.
2467,<|emo_disgust|> She had the nerve to comment on [NAME] doing a post about it. Nice to see /r/tworeddit finally take a stand for responsible entertainment
2469,<|emo_disgust|> Those things are hideous.
2470,"<|emo_disgust|> That sucks, good to know you're doing better. Stay positive friend!"
2471,<|emo_disgust|> i feel insulted after hearing stories of the suffering the poor animals suffer
2472,<|emo_disgust|> i feel wronged and upset i feel wronged for wronged i have wronged me on purpose
2474,<|emo_disgust|> So you are an idiot lol dont try to be funny.
2476,<|emo_disgust|> This is just a disgusting pic
2477,"<|emo_disgust|> >""We’re trying to be nice here"" Wow, the irony there "
2479,<|emo_disgust|> The internet never disappoints
2480,<|emo_disgust|> This is the most racist thing I've ever seen on this sub.
2483,"<|emo_disgust|> If you're saying he's not corrupt, you're saying he has a lot riding on his behavior. "
2484,<|emo_disgust|> Because it would appear that you are a horrible person.
2485,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I have no one for a wife"" Wow so selfish and creepy."
2487,<|emo_disgust|> It's disgusting how successful some of these are in alienating others. Some parents are just awful.
2488,<|emo_disgust|> This is pretty disgusting. Totes.
2489,"<|emo_disgust|> What an obnoxious, drunk girl. "
2490,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking idiot lolol
2491,<|emo_disgust|> Who has the edge when it comes to being ugly? Kids.
2492,<|emo_disgust|> That damn booth.
2493,<|emo_disgust|> There was a horrible accident. He'll be okay.
2494,<|emo_disgust|> What a hate sub.
2495,<|emo_disgust|> This is so disgusting. I can’t even look at it.
2496,<|emo_disgust|> How many lives has that ruined?
2497,"<|emo_disgust|> He's a jerk, and he knows it. He's just trying to cover it up."
2499,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is awful... but the last scene where he dives into a pool of money for sex is quite nice.
2500,<|emo_disgust|> What's the matter with your taste? I'maging for a sweet tooth.
2501,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah there's this creepy dude in my neighborhood who keeps watching my kids. It's creepy.
2502,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I have a hard time sleeping in socks. My balls are still tough, but there's just not room for that anymore."
2504,<|emo_disgust|> But that's besides the fact [RELIGION] is a *jihad* and [RELIGION] is a *holy war* soooooo guess I'm alone
2507,<|emo_disgust|> What a weird woman
2508,"<|emo_disgust|> It’s honestly insane how many layers of tape these things have these days. We live in a post 9-11 world, what choice do we have. "
2509,<|emo_disgust|> Just because it’s dark outside doesn’t mean it’s pitch black inside.
2510,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah no. They don't care how you make your living lol. How is that a problem?
2511,<|emo_disgust|> Your parents are assholes.
2512,<|emo_disgust|> It would be weird but also not terrible.
2514,"<|emo_disgust|> This comment killed me, I can’t imagine thinking this is compassionate"
2515,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] what a fucking weirdo
2517,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] would be pissed.
2518,<|emo_disgust|> How incredibly dangerous
2519,<|emo_disgust|> I want my fucking cake back.
2520,<|emo_disgust|> Why do you think I’m ugly?
2521,"<|emo_disgust|> No, she was under the impression that it was a positive action she had been trying to get over. Aghh so hateful tbh"
2522,"<|emo_disgust|> Weirdo, if you don’t want to hear the end of an elevator call I am calling the police."
2523,<|emo_disgust|> You are disgusting and need to be Removed from society
2524,"<|emo_disgust|> I mean, it’s still a horrible argument when you’re talking about race, but it’s damn near impossible to not go with the statistical majority here. "
2525,<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest part is that many of them are directly involved in the drug trade.
2526,<|emo_disgust|> Oh damn.
2527,"<|emo_disgust|> The problem is, the cops only give a vague description of the suspect, making it guess at your identity."
2528,<|emo_disgust|> It sucks that politics has turned into something so toxic that it requires serious mental gymnastics to not fall for it.
2529,"<|emo_disgust|> The sad thing is, we probably would have won without him. [NAME] was just a bad rebounder"
2530,<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest thing about this is how many times it's been done.
2532,<|emo_disgust|> There is something fishy going on here with this story
2533,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is the worst [NAME].
2534,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] just let his anxiety kill him
2535,<|emo_disgust|> i feel less grouchy about wearing expensive suits in public
2536,<|emo_disgust|> I’m actually angry at this post. I’m so angry that the person who made this post could be so hateful and condescending.
2537,<|emo_disgust|> Your an idiot
2538,<|emo_disgust|> What a disgusting person [NAME] is
2539,<|emo_disgust|> > And she's older than everyone > including her son.
2540,<|emo_disgust|> i didn t realize my dog was an asshole until i actually tried to comfort him and he started to become angry when i would say he liked treats and put them next to his food then put his head down and looked me in the face
2541,<|emo_disgust|> Because the false accusation makes my anxiety worse
2542,<|emo_disgust|> How dare [NAME] disrespect [NAME].
2543,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] even has issues remembering his names.
2544,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] this is so true
2545,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn it, [NAME]!"
2546,<|emo_disgust|> This is beautiful.
2547,"<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking obnoxious, drunk girl. "
2548,<|emo_disgust|> She’s just using her position as an office worker to get attention. How terrifying.
2549,<|emo_disgust|> So you're a racist?
2551,<|emo_disgust|> If there was a way to send a text to a girl in your phonebook that would apparently get her to actually fuck you up.
2552,<|emo_disgust|> No no youre not
2553,<|emo_disgust|> i feel this way as well
2554,<|emo_disgust|> We have to start finding ways to avoid using them at all. That seems like such a huge waste of time.
2555,<|emo_disgust|> You're creepy.
2556,<|emo_disgust|> i feel all smug over it all
2557,<|emo_disgust|> Why do we keep trying?
2558,<|emo_disgust|> Damn the fan base didn't like him before he signed his jersey
2559,<|emo_disgust|> What a nasty goal. Gave the away team an incredible advantage.
2560,<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell thought he was dead. I've always liked [NAME] but this is incredible
2561,"<|emo_disgust|> It can be disgusting, but it's also actually a lot less disgusting than, say, eating cockroaches."
2562,<|emo_disgust|> I do sometimes but I hate myself for doing it. It's not worth it to put more effort into it.
2563,<|emo_disgust|> It is more common for a man to put on a women’s bra or a woman to look like she’s giving off his/her period.
2564,<|emo_disgust|> You're an ugly fuk
2565,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, that's ugly."
2566,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I’m afraid to fly.
2569,<|emo_disgust|> Soooo [NAME] are you really that bad lol
2570,"<|emo_disgust|> Heh. I can see how that would sound like ""fuck off, it's perfectly acceptable to grope women on the bus""."
2572,<|emo_disgust|> I hated the Celtics until I got to know them a little better.
2574,<|emo_disgust|> But he is a racist! /s
2575,<|emo_disgust|> That's so disgusting. She isn't even a local. She's from Georgia. Get her mom a ride home.
2576,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh damn, is that who made that up? I think I may have seen it"
2578,<|emo_disgust|> But it's worse because the homes are so ruinous. Where the hell did that truck come from?
2579,<|emo_disgust|> I like surprises.
2580,<|emo_disgust|> I’ve been kicked in the leg repeatedly by these refs.
2581,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck they're all over the place
2582,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I’m angry [NAME] and [NAME] should get the franchise
2583,"<|emo_disgust|> I’m just gonna start scamming people here for money, it’s so sad!"
2584,<|emo_disgust|> You're the worst kind of person.
2585,<|emo_disgust|> Wow I'm shocked they're letting vulnerable people get arrested for doing the same shit.
2587,<|emo_disgust|> People who are too afraid to come out and say they are gay because they are afraid of being LGBT being called homophobic or simply just weird.
2588,<|emo_disgust|> You know it's true but its depressing to see.
2589,"<|emo_disgust|> I feel so bad for them but honestly, I couldn't really care or understand the insincerity of most of them."
2590,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn straight. I’ve ever seen it before, it’s horrible, but it worked "
2591,<|emo_disgust|> I love [NAME] but man I hate [NAME] as well....
2592,<|emo_disgust|> This is very clearcut and absolutely disgusting. This is the kind of education that lets terrorists breed.
2593,<|emo_disgust|> This is so horrifying. I literally feel helpless.
2594,<|emo_disgust|> It had such weird borders for both England and Scotland. Couldn't have been further apart.
2595,"<|emo_disgust|> Don't you know? We have the biggest media in the country that doesn't covering anything. I'm not saying it's a good thing, I'm saying they should."
2596,<|emo_disgust|> Thats awful. Didnt expect that to actually end well for him. What a tragedy.
2597,<|emo_disgust|> People are legitimately monsters.
2599,<|emo_disgust|> This sub sounds hella racist
2603,<|emo_disgust|> I had the same problem for a few years until I got off of antiandry for a while. I'm definitely back on antiandry but I feel it's better for my mental health not worse.
2604,<|emo_disgust|> What is wrong with a healthy gut
2605,<|emo_disgust|> That's just racist. No one wants [NAME] but you need to make up your mind.
2606,<|emo_disgust|> Because it's creepy?
2607,<|emo_disgust|> He just needs to beatwing to get that 2nd goal...
2608,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you ask if you are straight! /s
2609,"<|emo_disgust|> It’s called a tucker barre. You're not eating a sandwich that’s meat-free, you are eating a barre."
2610,<|emo_disgust|> That’s the weirdest thing I’ve seen on reddit today
2611,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] what a fucking cunt
2612,<|emo_disgust|> I don't understand a fucking thing [NAME] says because he’s a fucking moron.
2613,<|emo_disgust|> The guy fiths
2614,<|emo_disgust|> I have spent an awful lot of time trying to figure this one out but right now I'm just pissed off that I put it off so long.
2615,"<|emo_disgust|> I've seen this gif before, it's horrid."
2616,<|emo_disgust|> This is the dumbest thing I've read today
2618,<|emo_disgust|> Your a freak!
2619,<|emo_disgust|> I’m not being homophobic I just hate them.
2620,<|emo_disgust|> I hate when that happens
2621,"<|emo_disgust|> That'd be child abuse, plain and simple."
2622,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch!!!!! That hurt me just watching.
2623,<|emo_disgust|> A guy calls you an animal and calls it his own! How do you feel about that?
2624,<|emo_disgust|> But in reality they're an attractive stereotype.
2625,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird, we should probably save this one for another post."
2626,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch. So sorry! I think my brain is still damaged. Stay strong!
2627,<|emo_disgust|> i was feeling very dissatisfied with my son
2628,<|emo_disgust|> This made me pretty damn angry before I read the addendum
2629,<|emo_disgust|> He can’t do that I’m with you guys.
2630,<|emo_disgust|> Oh yeah. I hate him too. My apologies
2631,<|emo_disgust|> I can't wait till he’s in the DoU
2632,<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck? I thought it read like if you liked [NAME] you hated [NAME]. Weird.
2633,<|emo_disgust|> > it's actually weird to think about a future where [NAME] never leaves the team What’s weird is you still want him to leave the team now.
2634,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, it's more like your husband hates the thought of giving his son a gun"
2635,<|emo_disgust|> My boyfriend has learned how to do this too. He's gotten so used to getting it on in the morning.
2636,<|emo_disgust|> > They're mad because they thought he wouldn't get it after being passed the half line 3 times And no matter how many times [NAME] passes up the open man [NAME] doesn't pass up the open man
2637,<|emo_disgust|> I'm with you! He was hurting our team terribly
2638,<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck did [NAME] say to her? She's a dumbass.
2639,<|emo_disgust|> That dude just had his eyes opened like a fucking moron.
2640,<|emo_disgust|> That's weird. Did he just lose energy while typing those lines?
2641,<|emo_disgust|> This is one of the more weird I've seen.
2642,<|emo_disgust|> So cringy and desperate. Imagine being that stupid. Sad.
2643,<|emo_disgust|> That may be more down to his position as a [NAME] than anything else but honestly I wouldn't pay as much attention to that if he isn't there.
2644,<|emo_disgust|> Thats just disgusting. How do you explain that?
2646,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck these calls
2647,<|emo_disgust|> You are pathetic.
2648,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah the weirdest thing is he actually did say that. It was just during one of his more bizarre interview moments
2649,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] looked pretty awful on the road
2650,<|emo_disgust|> I can’t wait to get cut and send to a place that doesn’t care about hockey anymore then...
2651,<|emo_disgust|> It's more of a stereotype than any others. [NAME] is just a pleasant presence as well.
2653,"<|emo_disgust|> He said nah, his team is talented enough to beat anybody. "
2654,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, that sucks."
2655,<|emo_disgust|> i feel greedy for my time
2656,<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest thing is he actually talks in third person.
2657,<|emo_disgust|> This is horrible.
2658,<|emo_disgust|> You literally didn't vote for her...vote for someone else
2659,<|emo_disgust|> I fucking hate [NAME]
2660,<|emo_disgust|> Who the fuck thought he was dead
2661,<|emo_disgust|> You have to leave the house
2663,<|emo_disgust|> I don’t think the other options were worse.
2664,<|emo_disgust|> I mean [NAME] might be trash but he seems to adore him so much
2665,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I'm fucking starving.
2666,<|emo_disgust|> I mean that’s the point you are making. It was done with great care in mind and that’s disgusting.
2667,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a piece of shit. This video is just stupid.
2668,"<|emo_disgust|> Fuck, just look at all the trash at the airport!"
2669,<|emo_disgust|> This is worse than the [NAME] video.
2670,<|emo_disgust|> I think everyone would enjoy it more if you did
2671,<|emo_disgust|> i feel dissatisfied with myself
2673,<|emo_disgust|> Omg yes!
2674,<|emo_disgust|> It seems fairly random... can't explain it by any other means.
2675,<|emo_disgust|> I have serious second thoughts about doing this
2676,<|emo_disgust|> I would absolutely be uncomfortable with him running as an independent if it meant that he lost.
2677,<|emo_disgust|> I'd be creeped out. Especially given the amount of creepy creepy videos you can find of him.
2678,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh and by saying that, I mean that I don't like getting flamed."
2679,<|emo_disgust|> How's your relationship with her? Are you always this aloof?
2680,<|emo_disgust|> It's still a weird thing people do.
2681,<|emo_disgust|> i feel a little tortured just thinking about all the time i spent with him
2682,<|emo_disgust|> What a complete and utter asshole.
2683,<|emo_disgust|> I was in shock as this was posted minutes ago.
2684,<|emo_disgust|> This is the saddest thing I've seen today. What a cruelly poetic fact.
2685,<|emo_disgust|> This is how you run a porno
2686,<|emo_disgust|> She looks sick.
2687,<|emo_disgust|> Now this is cringe. You can't imagine how disgusted he is with himself.
2688,<|emo_disgust|> It looks like garbage to me.
2689,<|emo_disgust|> How the hell is that sub real. The only thing it has going for it other sigs that were pretty lame all game are fake
2690,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, [NAME] is getting smacked around these parts. "
2692,<|emo_disgust|> You dirty abo
2693,<|emo_disgust|> When I called them out for supporting US military. They said their military would not allow it. I cut them off.
2694,"<|emo_disgust|> No, I don't mind sex between animals, but an entire species being slaughtered for a sport... "
2695,<|emo_disgust|> The least disgusting result
2697,<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting. Apt.
2699,<|emo_disgust|> They’re wrong. It really sucks to be so judgemental and sensitive with the people you love... People are gross and insane.
2700,<|emo_disgust|> I just want to run away from my problems
2701,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so selfish and stupid because i want so badly for people to feel jealous and hurt
2702,<|emo_disgust|> That was bloodier than a 1st order zombie.
2703,<|emo_disgust|> That's so sad.
2704,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] isn't getting enough love for the garbage he does.
2705,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] why are you so angry?
2706,<|emo_disgust|> Why do we hate [RELIGION] so much? They are the only ones who actually follow [RELIGION].
2707,<|emo_disgust|> I'm the least impressed by [NAME].
2708,<|emo_disgust|> How dare they have a gun debate in the subreddit? Should have left that bit alone.
2709,<|emo_disgust|> That’s pretty lewd.
2710,<|emo_disgust|> What in the actual fuck is going on here.
2711,<|emo_disgust|> Weird yet effective
2713,<|emo_disgust|> My name's [NAME]. I'm here to tell you how ugly this game is becoming
2714,"<|emo_disgust|> I mean, he's got a point. But also the [NAME] was really bad for that."
2715,<|emo_disgust|> This is me all the time and it's getting to be a real problem.
2716,<|emo_disgust|> What a joke. Sorry.
2717,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is such a weirdo I’d be really surprised if he didn’t say these things.
2718,<|emo_disgust|> Holy fuck this is the sweetest. 💕
2720,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is getting old
2721,<|emo_disgust|> Not surprised as I've been told many times it's not uncommon for that to happen.
2722,<|emo_disgust|> You don't. What you're doing is disgusting.
2723,<|emo_disgust|> So you came to my college and didn’t want to be my roommate because you’re asexual?
2724,<|emo_disgust|> i feel the need to go into a little more detail on the negative side of things
2725,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is actually a really bad defender
2726,<|emo_disgust|> So rude.
2727,<|emo_disgust|> It's creepy
2729,<|emo_disgust|> What a dumb move.
2730,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn [NAME]
2731,<|emo_disgust|> Wow I wish we all had the same opinion... :(
2732,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling dissatisfied
2733,<|emo_disgust|> It's a shame that people are still fallible and will occasionally let slip the most disgusting of truths
2734,<|emo_disgust|> That picture is haunting
2735,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck it guys let [NAME] do his thing
2736,"<|emo_disgust|> Fuck you, [NAME]. Your fucking ad"
2738,<|emo_disgust|> I feel attacked
2739,<|emo_disgust|> The way people get started in recovery is by intimidating and setting the precedent of their own recovery.
2740,<|emo_disgust|> That is absolutely disgusting.
2741,<|emo_disgust|> >I have a hard time sleeping in socks because it gets so warm I get extremely cold. socks help.
2742,"<|emo_disgust|> You know what? If he does keep the reigniting, I'm happy he quit. [NAME] has a track record of injuries, he'll probably start the replacements"
2745,"<|emo_disgust|> My favorite team was the 1999 squad, so losing [NAME] to the Leafs is a bitter pill to swallow."
2746,<|emo_disgust|> Those women are the worst.
2747,<|emo_disgust|> Don’t think you are alone cause it happened to me too. My story has just started coming out for me
2748,<|emo_disgust|> It's a weird thing to say about yourself.
2749,<|emo_disgust|> But your post history sucks.
2750,<|emo_disgust|> Oh I don't think you'll hear it from me. I'm terrible at this I swear.
2751,<|emo_disgust|> The reason you have low self esteem is because you look like a pile of shit.
2753,<|emo_disgust|> Why did you link this out to be awful for me?
2754,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is running for cover while being shot at
2757,"<|emo_disgust|> I can't even understand why you're upset. I've got a Bachelors degree in Accounting and I'm in my early 3 Exactly Exactly, its like people are looking for a cheap way to whine when they have no ability to"
2758,<|emo_disgust|> i felt somewhat disturbed by the song and was not able to feel anything afterwards
2759,<|emo_disgust|> No but [NAME] is so much worse
2760,<|emo_disgust|> The third picture is creepy.
2761,<|emo_disgust|> i do feel a little bit offended that it is one of my peers that has the worst opinion of me
2762,<|emo_disgust|> That’s not the same fucking gun
2763,"<|emo_disgust|> If your parents divorced you and put the kids up for adoption just because you said no fucking questions, how are you the son?"
2764,"<|emo_disgust|> No, he didn't."
2765,<|emo_disgust|> Damn. I betcha a lotta women claim that but no...
2767,<|emo_disgust|> If there's a hidden camera in it you might see it. I wouldn't bother.
2768,<|emo_disgust|> If you do give in you are giving into hate thinking for power games. You should stop.
2769,<|emo_disgust|> i still find myself feeling agitated
2770,<|emo_disgust|> Oh geez [NAME] let himself go
2771,<|emo_disgust|> Who said they hated sex? Fucking moron.
2772,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not a huge [NAME] fan but even I'm not THAT envious of the Italian forward.
2774,<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell thought he was dead
2775,<|emo_disgust|> I mean I don't like the look of him. He can be a bit grumpy when things don’t go his way
2776,<|emo_disgust|> If this was a dating sub its definitely a bad one.
2777,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn. Yeah, it seems like it’s pretty safe from anyone who knows about it. "
2778,<|emo_disgust|> My daughter told me she used a condom less than once every two days back when I was her age and I was shocked
2779,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so greedy
2780,<|emo_disgust|> I just hated how much I liked it.
2782,"<|emo_disgust|> I had to rewind to the 5th grade video before I remember this, now I'm disgusted. "
2783,"<|emo_disgust|> She's ugly, period."
2784,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is what you get when you mix together [NAME]. I wish they'd just stay away from that chemistry.
2785,<|emo_disgust|> They can call you any name they want they're not going to stop until they find a reason to stop harassing you. Tell them its a lie lmao
2786,<|emo_disgust|> The secondhand panic I feel after watching this is amazing.
2787,<|emo_disgust|> A creepy little robocough poster.
2788,<|emo_disgust|> This sub is getting pretty weird.
2790,"<|emo_disgust|> I feel a little bit bad for the people who contracted measles, but here's a picture of the measles patient after he had his sinus infection"
2791,<|emo_disgust|> Just get out before it's too late :D
2792,"<|emo_disgust|> If it's one of my favorite seasons, I think I'm in for a really fun fall (or winter, for those in the midwest)."
2794,<|emo_disgust|> It sounds absolutely horrible.
2795,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh man, I felt terrible for laughing at that last part."
2796,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] just needs a hug
2797,"<|emo_disgust|> Well fuck you too, I just took my dog for a walk outside the shed just feet away from the dumpster"
2798,<|emo_disgust|> What a waste of packaging.
2799,<|emo_disgust|> What a backtrack on one of [NAME] biggest talking points. When is she going to get her divorce...
2800,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] you people are disgusting.
2801,<|emo_disgust|> This guy is just angry that the elite college sports media has ignored him like a hot damn.
2802,"<|emo_disgust|> They've all fucked you, just not in your room."
2803,<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting. Do you know where those dirty diapers are?
2804,<|emo_disgust|> i shouldnt feel wronged by this man
2805,<|emo_disgust|> That seems a little paranoid
2806,<|emo_disgust|> I hate [NAME] even more now.
2807,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck you [NAME] you were never the better for it.
2808,<|emo_disgust|> Those are hoteps. I don't want to go there any time soon.
2810,<|emo_disgust|> Because no one wants to be that girl.
2811,<|emo_disgust|> She looks so damn Asia.
2812,<|emo_disgust|> You literally do not understand what fascism is.
2813,"<|emo_disgust|> Just a man, can’t date her... Also I think the guy with thebeard is the same guy who is horrible on [NAME]"
2814,<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry *about* that. The unfortunate thing is that when I was older I hadn't the strength to correct many of them.
2815,<|emo_disgust|> Well that sucks actually
2816,<|emo_disgust|> Because it's creepy and weird
2819,<|emo_disgust|> It's creepy and sad
2820,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm also from Nashville, and I've never had a single argument despite being 50-ish."
2821,<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell thought he was dead and was calling him a bastard.
2822,<|emo_disgust|> How does it feel to be the most hated team in the nfl?
2823,<|emo_disgust|> I mean it sucks but... Okay then
2824,<|emo_disgust|> Well that makes me wonder why he's a mod some days isn't it?
2825,<|emo_disgust|> I’m so fucking evil
2826,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah fuck you too okay
2827,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch! That hit hard
2829,<|emo_disgust|> i was going to post this but i feel rather offended by the fact that any of you out there even bothered to read it
2830,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh no, I can’t do that unfortunately. Sorry about that!"
2831,"<|emo_disgust|> That's worse, they were right?"
2833,"<|emo_disgust|> It's a bit weird to say ""boys don't play sport"" but here we go. "
2834,"<|emo_disgust|> She's a pro-Assad piece of shit, which is worse because [NAME] said she is."
2835,<|emo_disgust|> My biggest Nightmare is Toachethood
2836,"<|emo_disgust|> That would be child abuse, plain and simple."
2837,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is just too damn talented for the bench
2838,<|emo_disgust|> Oh it's not! We need to move her out or get her mental health checked out!
2839,<|emo_disgust|> Why wouldn't you know? He’s a public figure. a public figure?
2840,<|emo_disgust|> Not good at all.
2841,<|emo_disgust|> Just go home already.
2842,<|emo_disgust|> She's hideous
2844,<|emo_disgust|> That looks like total garbage.
2845,<|emo_disgust|> I’m wondering if that was the only thing weird about him being there for a week.
2846,<|emo_disgust|> I am scared you and all of us are too.
2847,"<|emo_disgust|> Shut up, nerd."
2848,"<|emo_disgust|> You're a mean one tbh, use some common sense tbh."
2849,<|emo_disgust|> I am so sad.
2850,<|emo_disgust|> She will become that or worse. I pray that this is just the beginning.
2852,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird because they look almost exactly the same
2853,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst we've gotten in a while
2854,<|emo_disgust|> But we can't do anything about it because the state doesn't want to pay for it!
2855,<|emo_disgust|> i don t know what to think to give the kids a hug if i was them i would feel embarrassed
2856,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] makes aggressive grunts while breathing
2857,<|emo_disgust|> My condolences!
2858,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you! I have no beef with your wife! Ok stop trying to pass as a man
2859,<|emo_disgust|> This was so stupid I’m sorry 🙌🏻🙌🏻
2860,<|emo_disgust|> Lol what a weird thing to say. Sorry I had to.
2861,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] that's a fuckin men
2862,<|emo_disgust|> The guy is clearly a horrible human being.
2863,"<|emo_disgust|> No, those are distressed distressed kittens. You need to get better at word choice and spelling."
2865,<|emo_disgust|> How'd you get your hands on such terrible weaponry? I'd love to use it...
2866,<|emo_disgust|> The media is aghast at any claim made by [NAME] that he’s a racist.
2867,<|emo_disgust|> He’s the worst.
2869,<|emo_disgust|> What a weird way to find out. I find the focus on her creepy.
2870,<|emo_disgust|> What a selfish ass n
2871,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah but the [NAME] story is worse honestly
2872,"<|emo_disgust|> So far, so good"
2873,<|emo_disgust|> If you don't have a smart phone to call you a stupid [NAME] then you need to get yourself vaccinated.
2874,<|emo_disgust|> I hate the Detroit sports media. Go figure.
2875,<|emo_disgust|> A few months ago I would have said you are a weirdo but now I just can't.
2876,<|emo_disgust|> He reminds me of that obnoxious gnarly old man from The Office.
2877,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is horrible...beating [NAME] is also horrible...
2878,<|emo_disgust|> i almost feel jealous at this point
2880,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, they don’t take them outside. Like if it was a establishment I was going to eat."
2881,"<|emo_disgust|> It's weird because every time [NAME] does it I'm like, 'Fuuuucking right this fuck off,'..."
2882,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME], now that's off my car!"
2884,<|emo_disgust|> Those lips...those lips are the worst
2885,<|emo_disgust|> Lol hate [NAME] as any fan of the show or movie would too.
2886,<|emo_disgust|> It looks like you're a little younger. But you have that edge that older generations fear.
2887,<|emo_disgust|> So...he's a moron.
2888,<|emo_disgust|> i feel quite bothered by this
2890,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, we need an offense that can run over defenses like that."
2891,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh fuck off, you guys actually listening to reason? You are the worst. "
2893,"<|emo_disgust|> Because some people are genuinely horrible people and don't want to be called that, but that doesn't change how awful and evil they are."
2894,<|emo_disgust|> If not for the support system that [NAME] has we might not be at the spot we are at today.
2895,"<|emo_disgust|> He will not be long for this earth, [NAME] is a mad man"
2896,"<|emo_disgust|> So, yeah, I'm not a [NAME] and I can never be one."
2897,<|emo_disgust|> I'm really starting to want to punch this guy in the face.
2898,"<|emo_disgust|> She's probably had at least two kids, and is probably just as disgusting in her current form as she was when she was 15"
2899,<|emo_disgust|> Fcuk you.
2901,<|emo_disgust|> Well... fuck
2902,"<|emo_disgust|> Because if she goes out with him, he'll just have to admit to her cheating and be hard on her!"
2904,"<|emo_disgust|> Don't get me wrong, he’s a very good, very funny writer but I think people should look at [NAME] first novel to better understand this."
2905,<|emo_disgust|> In that case... Happy Birthday!
2906,"<|emo_disgust|> Not gonna happen. Stay warm, continue eating crappy food, and if you notice any further problems - get out asap."
2908,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm just gonna ignore you for now, what a weird thread."
2909,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was so wrong
2910,<|emo_disgust|> What a pathetic and immoral thing to say.
2911,<|emo_disgust|> Your post history is absolutely telling. Maybe worse.
2912,<|emo_disgust|> The fact someone with depression says they don't want to go to a job interview is pretty telling.
2913,<|emo_disgust|> Not really. Maybe one of the worst minds you'll ever meet.
2914,<|emo_disgust|> Lol that’s creepy. Your age difference is incredibly creepy.
2915,<|emo_disgust|> Why would you say that? It's so damn frustrating and hurts my brain.
2917,"<|emo_disgust|> What a bummer. But mostly, it shows how education is the best thing to do."
2918,<|emo_disgust|> It’s probably even worse than I thought
2919,<|emo_disgust|> When my wife and I were getting married our favorite was a picture of our wedding band
2920,<|emo_disgust|> It seems they forgot [NAME] was still a free agent in the first place.
2923,<|emo_disgust|> Oh geez that video. What a nightmare. I watched it on YouTube
2924,"<|emo_disgust|> That was more disgusting than the Holy Land, let alone the Arabian Peninsula. "
2925,"<|emo_disgust|> This is what I told her, she just ignored me. "
2927,"<|emo_disgust|> It was the worst radio ever, at least from what i remember."
2928,<|emo_disgust|> This is kinda sad. I feel bad for the kids but this would be really weird to force them to do.
2929,<|emo_disgust|> I think the last three are pretty spot on lol. I can definitely relate. She was cold at times there too.
2930,<|emo_disgust|> I feel your pain.
2932,<|emo_disgust|> >and people hated them. Not saying your opinion is wrong but apparently the media hated them.
2933,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing about this video is the music.
2934,"<|emo_disgust|> No it isn't, there's no way around them saying no, you can't go in there! "
2935,<|emo_disgust|> They're just mad because his video game apparently isn't called Rocket League...
2936,<|emo_disgust|> Holy crap that was bad...
2937,<|emo_disgust|> Well that sucks then. Personally I'd rather give them money than have them rob someone
2938,<|emo_disgust|> They would stop caring if we did. How horrifying.
2939,<|emo_disgust|> I hate to say it but it really does. I really do.
2941,<|emo_disgust|> They're mad
2942,<|emo_disgust|> He looks sick.
2943,<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting. It's worse than the god damn chicken wire.
2944,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Ouch! My heart! I think I've just had a stroke!"" - [NAME]"
2946,"<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell thought he was dead, seriously. The only thing he looks like to me is a badly skinned chicken"
2947,<|emo_disgust|> It's disgusting that there's even a subreddit for child abuse.
2948,<|emo_disgust|> This hurts me.
2949,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking hate [NAME] so much
2951,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds awful. What have I watched?
2953,<|emo_disgust|> That’s rude af.
2954,"<|emo_disgust|> Lol, ugh."
2955,<|emo_disgust|> i do feel bothered
2957,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, yeah, they're creepy."
2958,<|emo_disgust|> This is creepy and disgusting. Dump her and your disgusting old self.
2959,<|emo_disgust|> He's the most awful owner in bull history
2960,<|emo_disgust|> > So much can go wrong by the time you've been in.
2961,"<|emo_disgust|> It's weird, but yes, if you go ""full on fuckingtarian"" (essentially any non-biblical interpretation) you are an awful person. "
2962,<|emo_disgust|> That's a Shameful amount of Sesame oil.
2963,<|emo_disgust|> But it’s still *shitty* compared to the standards of living in the west.
2964,<|emo_disgust|> Your age advantage is disgusting.
2965,<|emo_disgust|> That shit definitely didn’t end well
2966,<|emo_disgust|> You're disgusting.
2967,"<|emo_disgust|> We have two of them, [NAME] is stupid"
2968,<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck does [NAME] have to do with the story? This is another story he told at the end.
2969,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like i need to be reassured even though im not the worst person
2970,"<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell thought he was dead, seriously!"
2971,"<|emo_disgust|> You can take offense to that being said, though."
2972,"<|emo_disgust|> It's weird, I love reddit."
2974,<|emo_disgust|> I'm jealous of [NAME].
2975,"<|emo_disgust|> The way you wrote that, I literally screamed."
2976,<|emo_disgust|> This is what I have been experiencing mostly lately. Very frustrating both physically and emotionally. One of my top 2-3 games played
2978,<|emo_disgust|> Omg the face
2979,<|emo_disgust|> What's the source? I love this.
2980,<|emo_disgust|> Because it looked horrible.
2981,<|emo_disgust|> It’s so weird I think it’s totally fake
2982,<|emo_disgust|> This is so incredibly creepy and disgusting. I just want to throw up.
2983,<|emo_disgust|> Well that is horrifying.
2984,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst they've ever done...
2985,"<|emo_disgust|> I have seen this meme used so many times, it makes me wonder just how old it is..."
2987,<|emo_disgust|> i feel angry
2988,<|emo_disgust|> My balls shrunk up looking at that
2989,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit I think I see cheekbones.
2991,<|emo_disgust|> Those people would love [NAME]
2992,<|emo_disgust|> Not good.
2993,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking lame ass title. Better stick to porn.
2994,"<|emo_disgust|> Who cares, they took it anyways."
2995,"<|emo_disgust|> No, there is nothing special about the way it looks or feels. It's all pretty old-fashioned."
2996,"<|emo_disgust|> We are all the Same in this world, we all hate ourselves "
2997,<|emo_disgust|> Who doesn't have a few months worth of saved between the three of you? Who wants to keep track of your spending like that.
2999,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, that was dirty."
3000,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a bimbo!
3001,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I gotta see [NAME]
3002,<|emo_disgust|> This is so adorable.
3003,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], just shut up"
3004,<|emo_disgust|> We have a problem here
3005,<|emo_disgust|> Don't know but I want my goddamn cake back
3007,<|emo_disgust|> i still feel a little bit dissatisfied and discouraged
3008,<|emo_disgust|> I'm just a dude on a phone in the rain. Have some water and a change of clothes.
3009,"<|emo_disgust|> It was a great read honestly, horrible writing style. It really just made me feel bad for author."
3010,<|emo_disgust|> The weird eyes....
3011,<|emo_disgust|> We don’t. I hate [NAME]
3012,<|emo_disgust|> Your sister humiliated you
3013,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn it.
3014,"<|emo_disgust|> She is what began to be called the ""girl next door"". Now it would be weird to call her a ""couch sex"" then it would be weird to call her a ""threesome""."
3016,<|emo_disgust|> You get what you pay for.
3017,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn, it looks like she has giant issues with smell."
3018,"<|emo_disgust|> ""PTSD"" is my particular mental health issues, sorry for the poor reply. 💘"
3019,<|emo_disgust|> She’s just an angry old woman with no idea of what she’s talking about lol.
3020,<|emo_disgust|> What are you on about now? That's wack.
3021,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing I'm surprised they have under 4 is probably weed.
3022,<|emo_disgust|> Wow i never even thought about that
3023,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like a dumbass for leaving the door open so i could have possibly gotten an offer to go see a movie
3024,<|emo_disgust|> It's very telling you did your worst.
3025,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah that’s bullshit. I did not say that it’s an option. I said it’s possible. Now that we’re convinced she’ll say no, we don’t care anymore."
3026,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't get the whole ""landing school"" bit. Why force a young adult to learn? That's rude."
3027,<|emo_disgust|> He’s a fucking moron.
3028,<|emo_disgust|> Your mental gymnastics and ignorance are astounding. Truly disgusting.
3029,"<|emo_disgust|> Not saying racist. Just saying, ""Crap, crap, mega crap"" seems to be his general approach."
3031,<|emo_disgust|> So much hypocrisy!
3032,<|emo_disgust|> I really hate him.
3034,<|emo_disgust|> This is the most awful thing I've ever seen. Take my upvote
3035,<|emo_disgust|> What a crazy thing to say.
3036,<|emo_disgust|> This is sick
3037,<|emo_disgust|> People on Reddit are being assholes. No one is saying don't let your kids go toerthe school. Your kid's their education.
3038,<|emo_disgust|> How is it racist? There's so many different words for skin tone in English - it's not *racial*.
3039,<|emo_disgust|> I don’t know what [NAME]’s talking about
3040,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so impatient because it happens so much
3043,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing about this is how proud [NAME] looked
3044,<|emo_disgust|> The fact he's aian makes me sad he's a romeo
3045,<|emo_disgust|> This is one of the worst I've seen...
3046,<|emo_disgust|> What a garbage post
3047,<|emo_disgust|> This is bad
3048,<|emo_disgust|> i feel pretty fucked up on a lot of levels right now
3049,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] doesn’t get a vote.... it is all damn fascinating.
3050,"<|emo_disgust|> He’s a disgusting snob, doesn’t like buying into bigwigs."
3052,<|emo_disgust|> I think we gave up too easy. Give him pressure
3053,<|emo_disgust|> That's horrible and disgusting. She should be embarrassed.
3054,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird that the US has no trade protectionism, this thread makes me sad "
3055,<|emo_disgust|> No it was my bad I don’t mind taking blame
3056,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I love bag designs
3057,"<|emo_disgust|> A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one."
3058,<|emo_disgust|> You are what's ruining America
3059,<|emo_disgust|> The worst part of this is it looks like it has no ID tag.
3060,<|emo_disgust|> I'm just fucking starving here in the middle of nowhere.
3061,<|emo_disgust|> i feel incredibly selfish to think that i will ever find a woman to share my life with as well
3062,"<|emo_disgust|> Because this is Reddit, apparently "
3063,<|emo_disgust|> But I'm scared as shit and have no one to turn to for help.
3065,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I was petrified...
3067,"<|emo_disgust|> It’s a terrible thing to do in my opinion. I’m so sorry that happened. You’re lucky to have an outside person like you, otherwise you wouldn’t have a voice"
3068,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird, he seems to have a lot of people sign up for his sub only to leave after discovering the scam."
3069,"<|emo_disgust|> A shitty situation, but something to keep you awake at night if you're already awake."
3070,<|emo_disgust|> I was being sarcastic and it made me swear off reddit
3071,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck off!
3072,<|emo_disgust|> This looks sick
3073,"<|emo_disgust|> The more horrifying the better. The more you see her struggle, the better your portrayal of her becomes."
3074,<|emo_disgust|> It's extremely disrespectful.
3075,<|emo_disgust|> I feel like I'm watching a horror movie straight out of the pages of VPR
3076,"<|emo_disgust|> A man gets punched in the face, thrown to the floor... then a pregnant woman walks out from the clinic without her babies."
3077,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is horrible...began eating dogs in his basement when he was 13
3078,<|emo_disgust|> You said your brother is a [NAME]. Stop lying. He’s not [NAME]. He’s [NAME]. I’M LITERALLY LITERALLY WALKING TO HELL MREL.
3079,<|emo_disgust|> Well I can see that but it's still really cringe
3080,<|emo_disgust|> That's so disheartening but also so very hopeful. I'm also heartened that you're all safe. 
3081,"<|emo_disgust|> When you're a college student and a guy asks if you're ""anally virgin"" is there any way to tell if he's being rude?"
3083,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not happy with him at all but I wish him nothing but the best.
3084,"<|emo_disgust|> It's so weird, but sometimes I think it's better to be racist then not."
3085,"<|emo_disgust|> No deal, abort, abort! abort!!"
3086,"<|emo_disgust|> So there you go, it was a fucking accident."
3087,<|emo_disgust|> This is just sad.
3090,<|emo_disgust|> I’m wondering where this is from.. must have gotten it from somewhere that isn’t Reddit. I’d hate to be that kind of community
3091,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is ugly btw.
3093,<|emo_disgust|> How the hell did I miss this
3094,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], your a racist and an idiot."
3096,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was terrible in 38 mins, glancing from time to time from deep and missing players out. Probably average too."
3098,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] so much hate.
3099,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is horrible.
3100,<|emo_disgust|> It would be weird if it was centered on him and the other half centered on [NAME]
3101,<|emo_disgust|> Your age difference is incredibly creepy.
3102,<|emo_disgust|> Damn! We need to sign [NAME] now
3103,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was a fucking monster on our high school team. Loved that team, would've hated to be on any other team"
3104,<|emo_disgust|> When my ex was caught by cops for aggravated assault on her pregnant wife
3105,<|emo_disgust|> Your character's an asshole.
3106,<|emo_disgust|> I'll take [NAME] over either of them any day.
3107,"<|emo_disgust|> You can't change what's already happened, and that includes the referendum result."
3108,<|emo_disgust|> Just shitpost
3109,<|emo_disgust|> This is so sad. [NAME] is a great writer and a great actor. Please keep her career.
3110,"<|emo_disgust|> The [NAME] is the one who needs to be ashamed, not [NAME]."
3111,<|emo_disgust|> How dare someone be so stupid as to post something so stupid on reddit. Im going to take this as an order of magnitude more serious than your post. Im posting stupid shit at 11:11
3112,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a horrible add on. Just use one of the women in your party instead.
3113,<|emo_disgust|> And I thought the US was the worst!!!
3114,<|emo_disgust|> She’s terrible
3115,<|emo_disgust|> It's a weird thing to say.
3116,<|emo_disgust|> I'm scared as shit that [NAME] is gonna say no to anything because the tone is so terrible.
3117,<|emo_disgust|> It's hard to tell if that's because he looks like a normal height 6 foot1 guy or just because of how he looks.
3118,<|emo_disgust|> You can’t make the adults angry just because this kid came inside and didn’t stay out. That’s sad.
3119,<|emo_disgust|> It’s really just bad luck and you have no control over it.
3120,<|emo_disgust|> Well just admit you're wrong and move on. Get back what is rightfully rightfully yours.
3121,<|emo_disgust|> i feel selfish and ashamed to admit i dont care
3122,<|emo_disgust|> I’m disgusted.
3123,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling very very unhappy with my work
3124,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has been an absolute mess this year
3125,"<|emo_disgust|> How many times has the ""Assad must go"" meme been shared!?!? Never seen it before now."
3127,<|emo_disgust|> That's very disturbing to hear. Are you with park service and should people be allowed to carry guns in your car?
3128,<|emo_disgust|> People on the internet will think it's hilarious if they hear it's not...
3129,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I hate reddit.
3131,<|emo_disgust|> It's hard to look at :(
3132,<|emo_disgust|> Oh of course they are. They're one of the most valuable players in the NHL. Stop being so crazy about everything.
3133,<|emo_disgust|> The fact it didn’t result in a [NAME] fatality makes it even more disgusting really.
3135,"<|emo_disgust|> I can’t get behind this because it’s so dumb and disgusting. But seriously, wtf is happening in this country?"
3136,<|emo_disgust|> When the wife shows disrespect for her husband. It's divorce.
3138,<|emo_disgust|> I remember hearing the New Mexico night shift en route from Houston once and the only thing that stood out was the heat.
3139,<|emo_disgust|> I can’t believe it actually did... how
3140,<|emo_disgust|> I’m on one now. One day. You take a lot of chances so it’s awesome if you do
3141,<|emo_disgust|> A fuckton of Bison.
3142,"<|emo_disgust|> I hate when my ex-girlfriend calls me and says,’""I don't like how you treated me."""
3143,"<|emo_disgust|> In that [NAME] picture, are the eyebrows or the eyes? "
3144,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking useless tool.
3145,<|emo_disgust|> That picture had me rolling lol. But ok
3146,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is the only person I've ever heard of who didn't get a pass on the check-in form.
3147,<|emo_disgust|> This is a terrible thing for men to do. It's like trying to drag a woman into a brothel without her knowledge.
3148,<|emo_disgust|> Lol you're a weirdo
3149,<|emo_disgust|> This is creepy af
3150,<|emo_disgust|> He also didn’t like [NAME] and [NAME] as players
3152,"<|emo_disgust|> We can say the same for the menopause, yet we're single. "
3154,<|emo_disgust|> This is just too damn creepy. Can't believe she's admitting she's a sex worker.
3155,<|emo_disgust|> Damn [NAME] is still a bitch
3156,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, what a bizarre post omg"
3157,"<|emo_disgust|> You have depression and anxiety, go outside and do something other than going for a walk. Try yoga, go outside."
3158,"<|emo_disgust|> I’m really starting to wonder if [NAME] is still in his 3-3 range. Not that he was awful last season, but he was awful pretty much everywhere."
3159,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds awful. I’m pretty new to the scene.
3160,<|emo_disgust|> The man has deep pockets and is a little weird. I'm a little sad for him.
3161,"<|emo_disgust|> It's hard to put a finger on why people are having these problems in the first place, maybe genetics and the environment?"
3162,<|emo_disgust|> But it’s the saddest thing I’ve heard about him.
3163,"<|emo_disgust|> It’s the ""I can’t imagine doing this without [NAME]"" part I hate."
3164,<|emo_disgust|> That's worse... how do I get out of this
3165,<|emo_disgust|> Well then why're you here. We already lost to the Leafs once in the first round. Maybe you want to keep the fan hate coming?
3166,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch. That's the worst I've ever seen. Take my upvote.
3167,"<|emo_disgust|> I know, sucks my balls off. Still a bitch though!"
3168,<|emo_disgust|> That's terrible. I wish I could help. Can you post a picture of some soap or something?
3169,"<|emo_disgust|> Who ever said porn was *bad*, it's *even worse* if you're a virgin"
3170,"<|emo_disgust|> It may feel strange at first since you're a young man who just spent the last moments of his life with a single woman. But trust me, you'll be okay. "
3171,<|emo_disgust|> Oh my [NAME] look at that body
3172,<|emo_disgust|> You can't blame him though! It’s likely the worst place he got into shit.
3173,<|emo_disgust|> No it does lol
3174,<|emo_disgust|> Damn....
3175,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is not being very forthright about his concerns about the direction the Canucks are headed and clearly he’s concerned at all with what’s playing on the wings
3176,<|emo_disgust|> My god [NAME] has two arms...those arms are fucking awful
3177,<|emo_disgust|> People like this make me so angry.
3178,<|emo_disgust|> Damn [NAME] has aged well.
3179,<|emo_disgust|> The guy that died in the wreck had possibly worse medical issues than I did
3180,<|emo_disgust|> This is the type of twitter conversation that started a war between Canada and the USA.
3181,"<|emo_disgust|> If she has a car that looks like this, it must have an oil change every 6 months."
3182,<|emo_disgust|> Worst case scenario is he got into a nasty scuffle with a homeless man.
3183,<|emo_disgust|> I hope you like the new ones worse BGs because they're terrible
3184,"<|emo_disgust|> Your posts are terrible. No one likes you, don't try to pretend otherwise."
3185,<|emo_disgust|> Your a horrible human being.
3186,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah it's like the worst of both worlds, you have a beautiful and talented but also extremely needy and needy-oriented person running your government"
3187,<|emo_disgust|> That's terrible. What a move.
3189,<|emo_disgust|> No problem. Have a nice day.
3191,<|emo_disgust|> i feel irritated and disappointed a few times a day
3192,<|emo_disgust|> The lack of interest is heartbreaking.
3193,<|emo_disgust|> Because it's easier to lie about something that's actually true than to lie about something that's not.
3194,<|emo_disgust|> > they're really fucking creepy.
3195,"<|emo_disgust|> It's weird, but I'm sorta in the same place as you on the scale. You have depression, anxiety, feelings of worthlessness. I'm not very different."
3197,<|emo_disgust|> She's the same one with all the crazy hair.
3199,<|emo_disgust|> Damn people on this sub are actually dumb
3200,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit I didn't realize [NAME] was that good.
3201,"<|emo_disgust|> Not sure the ""we need to look at ways we can help [NAME] fix his skills"" part..."
3202,<|emo_disgust|> You’re fucking disgusting
3204,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] looks even worse than I thought he would...
3205,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I've never seen this!"" - looks like a kid"
3206,<|emo_disgust|> This is creepy
3207,<|emo_disgust|> Oh god [NAME] just won the lottery
3208,<|emo_disgust|> My favorite joke on the show right now is [NAME] at the end where he talks about wanting to kill himself
3209,<|emo_disgust|> She should go to HELL
3212,<|emo_disgust|> They’re such a moody bunch!
3213,"<|emo_disgust|> Lol i dont think so, the dude looks obese and fits his needs, I'm amazed he wouldn't throw a fit if he found out what a waste of money and time the treadmill really is."
3215,<|emo_disgust|> Oh I hate that!
3216,<|emo_disgust|> That's just sad. Good riddance to awful opinion.
3217,<|emo_disgust|> I mean obviously this is bad news I feel bad for you. Stay strong 
3218,"<|emo_disgust|> My god, he's face fucking hideous "
3220,<|emo_disgust|> Damn [NAME] is ugly!
3222,<|emo_disgust|> How weird that this is also on the Torontoist website but not here.
3223,"<|emo_disgust|> What the hell are you talking about? Also, your using words that are completely irrelevant to discussions about this."
3224,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, I would think that would be disgusting. And you're right. But no, he's fine. You can't make any real informed decisions when your staff constantly repeat tired stuff without shreds of shredding evidence."
3225,<|emo_disgust|> I hate going to parties. Party culture is just so obnoxious.
3226,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so insecure because i dont know the girls i need to go out with
3227,<|emo_disgust|> I don't even know this woman.
3228,<|emo_disgust|> I think [NAME] should lose her job over this
3229,<|emo_disgust|> What a shame.
3230,<|emo_disgust|> That guy sounds like a jerk.
3231,<|emo_disgust|> You could put them under her control and keep them happy so they don't turn to abuse when they see what she is doing.
3232,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow they are getting extremely expensive. Surprised they let this one through, no wonder they have to lay off workers. "
3233,<|emo_disgust|> Well damn. I’m tired of these shits and I hate it.
3235,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking hate [NAME] and the triangle...
3236,<|emo_disgust|> I honestly hope the Detroit News front page turns into The Onion.
3237,<|emo_disgust|> I love the burn
3238,<|emo_disgust|> If you're talking about “school shooters” I'd be more concerned with the shooter in a movie who actually pulls the trigger (I'm not talking about random kids).
3239,<|emo_disgust|> They’re so greedy and indulgent! Shame that some people have the ability to see that!
3242,"<|emo_disgust|> This is creepy and weird and yes, yes I'm a woman."
3244,"<|emo_disgust|> So, the goal of this study was to asses the psychological risks of being an autism mum. Well, damn, I'm so disillusioned."
3245,<|emo_disgust|> Man I've spent wayyyyyyy more time on Reddit than this in my entire gaming career! I'm very impressed!
3246,<|emo_disgust|> And you’re a liar.
3247,<|emo_disgust|> Well it's inapplicable to everything that's happened in his or her life and it's completely irrelevant. Stop trying to bring anything in up.
3248,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating and disgusting. The level ofization and ignorance on display here is incredible.
3249,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you not love your child ❤️
3250,"<|emo_disgust|> That's just...sorry man, that's awful."
3251,<|emo_disgust|> How [NAME] is this different from [NAME]? I'm wondering if it’s a conscious effort.
3252,"<|emo_disgust|> A girl I knew had a crush on me for a while, well, she is also quite attractive now..."
3253,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fucking BEAST
3254,<|emo_disgust|> They played in the rain. It was miserable.
3256,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] looked so sad while he was applauding the refs. Ouch!
3257,<|emo_disgust|> I can’t even begin to imagine the horror of this
3258,<|emo_disgust|> i feel stressed by work im off meds and not doing much else to keep me in a good mood its good this work sucks
3259,<|emo_disgust|> People are having hard time understanding that the main reason to want to leave is to become a woman.
3261,<|emo_disgust|> Well that's disgusting
3263,"<|emo_disgust|> That’s one big, fat tear in my eye."
3264,<|emo_disgust|> That guy is actually a fuckin douche.
3265,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh wow, I didn't know all of that went into that comment. Thanks for clarify though, I was quite confused."
3266,<|emo_disgust|> This is just another day we've had of this guy being part of the Problematic fan base.
3267,<|emo_disgust|> There have been those dreadful moments. Some of the worst I've ever seen. But I won't put words in your mouth.
3268,"<|emo_disgust|> If he's saying you should not have sex because it's disgusting, that's pretty lewd."
3269,<|emo_disgust|> The saddest thing is he actually did give me that belt he said It's up to you I gotta get it back someday else what happens
3270,"<|emo_disgust|> I didn't even get a single ""cute"" comment. Not even a passing mention."
3271,<|emo_disgust|> The only sad part of this is that you are right
3272,<|emo_disgust|> And the other is the apartment in question was a multiple times worse for the environment.
3275,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, we're looking at a guy who hasn't played more than 30 NHL games since he was 34. Looks awful."
3276,<|emo_disgust|> I have a deep seeded hatred for toward the Babylon Bee ever since they started covering the Bexar County Juvenile diversion relantationships.
3278,<|emo_disgust|> i still feel like it s a bit sarcastic though for all the things i said
3279,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch. Did not know we had a pool like that.
3280,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I know you think that's why you think we're stupid. I'd rather be wrong and blame you than admit it's the only mistake we ever made"""
3281,<|emo_disgust|> I'll never understand how racist you are.
3282,<|emo_disgust|> It's a weird thing people do.
3283,<|emo_disgust|> They’re so fucking greedy
3284,<|emo_disgust|> She’s so disgusting
3285,<|emo_disgust|> That's just...not right.
3286,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating. What is wrong with you.
3287,<|emo_disgust|> What a weird way to ask a question about racism.
3288,<|emo_disgust|> This is awful and I hope her dad doesn't force her into anything.
3289,<|emo_disgust|> My wife is out for shabbos. I'd rather deal with the guilt of not being there.
3291,<|emo_disgust|> This is why she killed herself this is so infuriating.
3292,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that's dark
3293,<|emo_disgust|> People hate her but honestly... [NAME] loves kids... (granted)
3294,"<|emo_disgust|> But you're wrong I've been eating better, not worse "
3295,"<|emo_disgust|> You do realise that he is running from the consequences of his own actions? You'd be mad at a man for running away from his own shame, wouldn't you?"
3298,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, that's just too damn creepy."
3299,"<|emo_disgust|> This is a weird way to spell ""fucking government shutdown""."
3300,<|emo_disgust|> She didn't give you a pass for posting the pics
3301,<|emo_disgust|> Just look at all the trash at the airport
3302,<|emo_disgust|> i know how i feel but its still really sad to hear all the weird things that people say and how those things are still accepted even though they are wrong or disgusting
3303,<|emo_disgust|> It's not like we don't understand it or anything... just hell ya we're ignorance demons
3304,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting. No one should act like that to you.
3305,<|emo_disgust|> What a load of bull.
3306,<|emo_disgust|> i have little to no trust in other human beings and i feel absolutely disgusted that some people can give me trust and I hate those people
3307,<|emo_disgust|> I’m sorry I told you that I can’t keep listening to this
3308,<|emo_disgust|> That video is awful
3309,<|emo_disgust|> It's not a terrible thing but it's still incredibly creepy.
3310,"<|emo_disgust|> > but it's disgusting how their argument is essentially ""i don't care how you feel about women or black people"""
3311,<|emo_disgust|> That's a weird way to spell Disenchanted
3312,"<|emo_disgust|> It's been compared to [NAME] and [NAME] in that it's awful but equally, [NAME] has been compared to [NAME] who has had a slightly worse experience."
3313,<|emo_disgust|> Lol!!!
3314,<|emo_disgust|> This is me every single time. I can’t stand it
3315,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck you I’d rather have [NAME] play [NAME]
3316,<|emo_disgust|> I love him but he has a history of injuries....
3317,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is the worst manager in Scottish football history
3318,<|emo_disgust|> I mean the fact that she’s a model and she’s a stay at home mom is pretty shocking to me.
3319,<|emo_disgust|> How the hell do you moan tho
3320,<|emo_disgust|> i feel less violent and angry
3322,<|emo_disgust|> I'm sad that my favorite team isn't the Chargers. [NAME] Chargers :(
3323,<|emo_disgust|> This is the weirdest thing I've seen today
3325,<|emo_disgust|> Because your life is miserable
3326,<|emo_disgust|> Wow I got you bro
3327,<|emo_disgust|> Well damn what a shame that's exactly what it's gotten into.
3328,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is on fire!!!
3329,<|emo_disgust|> And it's worse as she herself is apparently a victim
3332,"<|emo_disgust|> It's a weird thing to be against against your own parents, isn't it?"
3333,<|emo_disgust|> It's so bonkers that no one is talking about ways to handle this.
3335,<|emo_disgust|> What? I’m not offended
3336,<|emo_disgust|> She's creepy.
3337,<|emo_disgust|> People should be able to have their own private lives without being pressured into wedcing into unwanted sexual relationships.
3338,<|emo_disgust|> People have always hated him on here but now I really do like him.
3342,<|emo_disgust|> I hate [NAME] and I love you
3343,<|emo_disgust|> Worst dad ever!
3344,<|emo_disgust|> I feel like it’s a little more trolling than usual lol. 😂
3346,"<|emo_disgust|> Just because she's a child, doesn't mean anything. She and her boyfriend are fucking disgusting."
3347,<|emo_disgust|> Don't fucking call the [NAME] a creeper just because you hate his music.
3349,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn I need to get that gym back together before they're even worse than they are now!!
3350,<|emo_disgust|> Damn it. Now I'm sad.
3351,<|emo_disgust|> What a gift!
3352,"<|emo_disgust|> A lot of the fault probably lies at the [NAME] end, as [NAME] is a monster "
3353,"<|emo_disgust|> When people don't like your music... WHY won't they just stop listening? It's your fault for being a ""jackass"" who wasn't listening."
3354,"<|emo_disgust|> The comments in this thread are absolutely disgusting. Reminds me of the ""I like being downvoted"" culture I saw in Turkey back in the day."
3355,<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest part about this is how good the [NAME] look
3356,<|emo_disgust|> There's a saying in Ireland it's worse dead than alive. Because the dead get to roost
3357,"<|emo_disgust|> And no, there was no assault. They were arguing!!"
3358,<|emo_disgust|> They were there in force too! I was there at about 2am and it was sheer terror that the situation was so bad.
3360,"<|emo_disgust|> That is incredibly creepy. And really, not true at all."
3361,<|emo_disgust|> No he wasn’t. He’s creepy
3362,<|emo_disgust|> i feel really hated and ignored
3363,<|emo_disgust|> And the worst is when they get an injury while playing defense.
3364,<|emo_disgust|> She's awful.
3365,<|emo_disgust|> It'd probably be worse than the [NAME] situation. [NAME] is a monster.
3366,<|emo_disgust|> That'd be a terrible idea
3367,<|emo_disgust|> You are a disgusting disgusting piece of filth.
3368,<|emo_disgust|> Wow. She can get off at any time. If you’re into fetish sex she sucks.
3369,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, she sounds like a moron."
3370,<|emo_disgust|> Oh well I have a bad feeling he'll back out because there's no way he backed out of that deal.
3371,<|emo_disgust|> You're just angry because people call you [NAME] instead of [NAME]
3372,<|emo_disgust|> That was a dirty hit
3373,"<|emo_disgust|> If you don't like it, you don't like it. If you don't like it, you're a tool."
3375,<|emo_disgust|> I don't care. My kid could die tomorrow of diarrhea from eating something disgusting
3376,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] this is amazing
3377,<|emo_disgust|> That’s one big MOTHERFUCKER!
3378,<|emo_disgust|> She's probably cheating on you.
3379,"<|emo_disgust|> I know, right?! We need more screen time for these guys so they can actually think for themselves instead of just assume things!"
3380,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is when you accidentally eat a tainted treat.
3381,<|emo_disgust|> Not really... They're looking for a reason to fire him and it's not even that he's done anything wrong.
3383,<|emo_disgust|> They've all done it and done it again. The problem is they haven't been caught.
3386,<|emo_disgust|> It's so ridiculous. He could save lives by getting these people into mental health programs.
3387,<|emo_disgust|> It’s even worse when they're fake
3388,<|emo_disgust|> Because it’s creepy.
3389,<|emo_disgust|> What a dumb idea.
3391,<|emo_disgust|> Because I'm stupid and want to go to a party with my best friend.
3393,<|emo_disgust|> My fault for never having had a child
3394,<|emo_disgust|> This is so awful that I literally cannot believe it. is also incredibly terrible right now because everyone is sick of him. hope everything works out for you.
3395,<|emo_disgust|> They're all so boring and dull. I can think of 3rd Person shooters that are good in a similar style!
3396,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't get it either, what the fuck is going on in your head bro?"
3397,<|emo_disgust|> He's a moron for thinking [NAME] is a slut
3398,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Why we here?"" Whyus."
3399,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] that’s awful.
3400,<|emo_disgust|> The only guy i’ve spent more time with hate me than him is the dad from across the street.
3401,"<|emo_disgust|> My dad used to watch porn as kids, he's got a long history of this too! And his porn still tastes bad to this day"
3402,"<|emo_disgust|> That's what I've been saying all along! But I know people think I'm crazy, I'm just being honest with them."
3403,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is awful defendin g
3404,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm with her, but with the exception of [NAME] the players are pretty awful for the most part."
3405,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck
3406,<|emo_disgust|> I'll never understand why the Nats are better at this than the Reds.
3407,<|emo_disgust|> I’m so sorry
3408,<|emo_disgust|> The only worse version of this.
3409,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating. Whataburger misses you.
3411,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is an absolute scumbag
3412,<|emo_disgust|> I'm sadder than [NAME] at this point.
3414,"<|emo_disgust|> Not any sort of a deal, just a scam."
3415,<|emo_disgust|> This looks so horrifying 🤣
3416,<|emo_disgust|> And they were devastated. So were we.
3417,<|emo_disgust|> That whole group of photos are haunting.
3418,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a hypocrite that’s how I feel about [NAME]
3419,"<|emo_disgust|> I'd say they should work on their eating habits. After all, they've been found to have high levels of both stomach cancer and stomach ulcers."
3421,<|emo_disgust|> When your parents are the baddies and the movie really is a bad one...
3422,"<|emo_disgust|> Not a single one expressed condolences, and all three said they hoped she's doing ok."
3423,<|emo_disgust|> That sub needs some serious work. Fuck the r/ComedyCemetery guys.
3424,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a hungry little bastard
3425,"<|emo_disgust|> A horrible thing to do, but his fault for not being informed of the health risks."
3426,<|emo_disgust|> So what you are saying is that you have no shame is you try to pretend to care about anybody other than yourself and your own needs is disgusting what a selfish and mean thing to do
3428,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds awful. I'm sorry for your loss; this is heartbreaking.
3429,"<|emo_disgust|> It can be hard to tell at first. But once you get past the initially condescending reception, it becomes a lot easier."
3430,<|emo_disgust|> It sucks that both of you think this kind of behavior is funny. None of you have ever seen a remotely funny meme.
3431,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm saying that even if it was within their rights, they may have been completely wrong in their thinking"
3432,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, hate that you said that, ""I don't know what exists on planet earth so I can't say that"" is pretty lame. "
3433,"<|emo_disgust|> I'll bet you that if she had a period before the photo shoot, it would have looked worse than this."
3434,"<|emo_disgust|> It's a weird thing. Some people have very specific thinking, and the only way to change their thinking is to try to 'cure' them."
3435,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I’m leaving YouTube. Scary.
3436,"<|emo_disgust|> What's that? It's from another sub! It's the same ""what's wrong with you"" crap I just posted there."
3437,"<|emo_disgust|> I swear to [NAME], these refs actually fucking hate us."
3438,<|emo_disgust|> You die.
3439,<|emo_disgust|> They are disgusting people inside and out.
3440,"<|emo_disgust|> Don't you know?! ""Bitches not guilty, they all tried so hard!"""
3441,<|emo_disgust|> I didn’t say we all should do this. I said you should do this to yourself.
3442,<|emo_disgust|> The comment was so terrible. I literally couldn't believe it.
3443,"<|emo_disgust|> That's not the point, people can be awful and turn their own lives around, there's nothing wrong with that."
3444,<|emo_disgust|> You'd think it's weird to have two hearts on your body... *aggressively tells friend to fuck off*
3445,<|emo_disgust|> What an idiotic thing to say...
3447,"<|emo_disgust|> What the hell is going on at USM? Seriously, the fanbase is getting irrationally angry about everything."
3448,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is not the worst [NAME]. There is [NAME].
3449,<|emo_disgust|> This might be the worst pass he ever threw. I think he just couldn't handle the throw
3451,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting.... please make more.
3452,<|emo_disgust|> It wasnt illegal until the cops used tear gas and beat people with batons
3455,<|emo_disgust|> i don t feel insulted in any way
3456,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck I’d sooner take my chances with the present and burn the present than have the flashbacks tomorrow morning
3457,<|emo_disgust|> Well I hate to be a part of this but the thing is....we love him.
3458,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME]. Don’t blame [NAME].
3459,<|emo_disgust|> You are creepy
3461,<|emo_disgust|> i feel this is a bit paranoid
3462,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing worse than this is having a child with the name [NAME].
3463,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Lazy ass"""
3464,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling dissatisfied because of what is going on
3465,<|emo_disgust|> This is the most racist thing I've ever seen.
3466,<|emo_disgust|> They are the worst of the 3.0.x flavours. I hate them so much.
3467,<|emo_disgust|> The only part of this that surprised me was the hat. The casual racism and references to [NAME] were surprises as well.
3468,"<|emo_disgust|> I like you, don't shoot me I don't like you."
3469,<|emo_disgust|> Now listen I don’t care give a shit about this but the guy is just terrible
3470,<|emo_disgust|> It's a great picture for a great article but...
3471,"<|emo_disgust|> Ouch, now I know they're lying about the cancer. Damn you, [NAME]."
3472,<|emo_disgust|> He looked genuinely surprised me
3473,<|emo_disgust|> What a dumb and cruel thing to say.
3474,<|emo_disgust|> I'd say there's a pretty high chance you're a troll.
3475,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, those refs actually fucking hated us."
3476,<|emo_disgust|> Well that sucks but I have the exact same idea lol
3478,"<|emo_disgust|> It’s a bit weird making her a victim, but you’re also playing into her hands. You could be making her feel bad or worse."
3480,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah that video is garbage
3481,<|emo_disgust|> >The whole thing is a shite job They are. Let the bullshit show and stop being part of it
3483,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking idiot.
3484,<|emo_disgust|> There's a surprisingly large amount of weirdo masculinity out there.
3486,<|emo_disgust|> I'm so hungry right now.
3487,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, who can vote because the literacy rate is much lower than the rest of the population "
3488,<|emo_disgust|> That damn Lookoutpost.
3491,<|emo_disgust|> Don’t say that I don’t understand this lol.
3492,"<|emo_disgust|> I did not mean to cause bother to her. Good for her though, for coming out to a stranger as she did is just incredibly brave, especially given how stalkery and supportive society has become. "
3493,<|emo_disgust|> i can remember feeling quite outraged when she told me the story of her mother and how she had found herself in a situation where many of the things that were most important to her were happening to her
3494,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing keeping him warm is shitposting.
3495,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is not going to win the majority of the popular vote and is certainly not going to win the majority of seats. I don't think either of them is a serious alternative for the next government.
3496,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking douche.
3497,<|emo_disgust|> The dude is so incredibly creepy.
3499,<|emo_disgust|> There's always been a creepy underbelly to Reddit culture
3500,<|emo_disgust|> > And she doesn't even want the best deal in the market because she is a business woman.
3501,<|emo_disgust|> That was the worst power play I have ever seen
3502,<|emo_disgust|> But you're *so* ugly...
3504,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is definitely when you go out in public and people still think you're creepy.
3505,<|emo_disgust|> It took me until [NAME] was about my age before I realized all the trash that has been thrown his way.
3506,<|emo_disgust|> This is a fucking noob. Thanks for not reading the note first!
3507,"<|emo_disgust|> My favourite has always been when he got up after the goal, with the goal still visible in the video...."
3508,"<|emo_disgust|> What the hell were you thinking people would actually go out of their way to find and fix a sign that reads ""Fuck [RELIGION]?"""
3509,<|emo_disgust|> I know all of that is true. I just find other people to be far worse.
3510,<|emo_disgust|> This is a particularly acrimonious argument because most of the people here are not liberals but rather alt right.
3511,"<|emo_disgust|> I want to say that I’m shocked, But also that I’m not totally sold. "
3512,<|emo_disgust|> That was worst defense I've ever seen.
3513,<|emo_disgust|> Who the fuck thought he was on the wrong side of the track
3514,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird how it works tbh. If I see a 2-star sign for a 3-star I decide not to get angry, because 3-star players are actually pretty rare."
3515,"<|emo_disgust|> Holy fuck, that really is not a good take."
3517,"<|emo_disgust|> When he finally does show up in the flesh, he is going to suck."
3519,"<|emo_disgust|> It has a weird sexual vibe, similar torent-boy."
3520,"<|emo_disgust|> She threatened to hurt your babies, I'm not making this up."
3521,<|emo_disgust|> It's a weird thing to worry about.
3522,"<|emo_disgust|> That's my wife, by the way. I hope she can handle this. She's a good person but she needs to grow up a little bit."
3523,<|emo_disgust|> That's how you get a lot of drunk people stranded in hostile territory
3524,<|emo_disgust|> Well now there you have it. No wonder people just hate [NAME].
3525,<|emo_disgust|> Just because something sounds awful doesn't mean it's true.
3526,<|emo_disgust|> Damn what a weird way to get high that you’re using to get high.
3527,<|emo_disgust|> What a bummer that was the last straw for him. A Better existence for him would have him taking back his drug habit within months.
3528,<|emo_disgust|> I thought these were slightly more mild and I was relieved that they weren't worse
3529,<|emo_disgust|> My whole life’s been a lie
3531,<|emo_disgust|> What? I don't give a damn. I'm a teacher and I'm making about $11 an hour. Still crazy. 
3532,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, is this the same article that said reddit is a terrible place to find porn?"
3533,<|emo_disgust|> I love this reply.
3534,<|emo_disgust|> That’s really creepy. What country?
3535,<|emo_disgust|> Damn she has a face!
3536,<|emo_disgust|> That one looks like a big ass sink.
3537,"<|emo_disgust|> No she didn't, she had a point."
3538,<|emo_disgust|> I'm shocked it only took [NAME] for her to get fired for this.
3539,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, it would have been a lot better if those two hadn't gotten together in the first place."
3541,<|emo_disgust|> Why yes that hurts
3542,<|emo_disgust|> They look like model teen bodies. They just want to have sex. It’s not their fault at all.
3543,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is actually a very dangerous coach because he doesn't seem to want to prepare his players for the real game....he just wants to throw them a few dumb plays
3544,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, I didn't think I'd see a comrade here..."
3545,<|emo_disgust|> It happens so much that it really scares me tbh.
3547,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is working for hire. That is what I did. I hated my job.
3548,<|emo_disgust|> i find that i often have to make a choice between going out for dinner with a group of women or running away rather then feeling tortured by some petty jealousy
3549,"<|emo_disgust|> The thing is, this was a shitty Thursday night game. "
3550,<|emo_disgust|> I hated her so much [NAME]
3551,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking bummer. Now I just want to go outside and kill myself
3552,"<|emo_disgust|> You should know better than to downvote someone, especially something your parent said."
3554,<|emo_disgust|> A lot of that is people telling women they shouldn't wear heels
3555,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I hate them so much
3556,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, that's really the only acceptable answer you have. Tell her not to eat anything pink ever again, and take steps to avoid it future wedples. "
3557,"<|emo_disgust|> Not sure what it is about the “naxxramas” that have made people play it. It's a pretty new expansion, and the core set seems awful."
3558,<|emo_disgust|> Not to be the laughing stock of the industry but he's honestly amazed at how he can do it
3559,<|emo_disgust|> He’s disgusting
3560,<|emo_disgust|> But [NAME] was worse
3562,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that’s one way to make an anti-discrimination claim.
3563,<|emo_disgust|> The best you can expect from a young [NAME] is to act like a kid even when your body's a mess
3564,"<|emo_disgust|> I'll tell you what it was about. An old couple showed up with their daughter, and the mother had to do something very unexpected. The reason is the same but with a whole new set of circumstances!"
3565,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, i don't have a lot of other options."
3566,<|emo_disgust|> She's literally worse than [NAME]
3567,"<|emo_disgust|> In that case... I’m sorry for your loss, and I’m praying for your family."
3568,<|emo_disgust|> You need to get out and try your damn job. I'm sorry your girlfriend is so mad at you. You have to learn to treat people like human beings.
3569,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] how awful
3570,<|emo_disgust|> When the guy holding the sign looks back at him and then back at the person that said we don’t want to play....
3571,<|emo_disgust|> A-fucking-men! That’s the only sexual response that women can give! That’s rape!
3572,<|emo_disgust|> I am not surprised that there are so many depressed people in this sub. It's very apparent. I had a similar story last week.
3573,<|emo_disgust|> i don t want to be the one feeling rejected
3574,<|emo_disgust|> Because you're too stupid to understand that the U.S. has entered the worst budget crisis since World War 2.
3575,<|emo_disgust|> They just don't like him knowing how many times he cheated.
3576,<|emo_disgust|> She must hate her father.
3577,<|emo_disgust|> You’re too ugly to vote for her. I hate people like you.
3579,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah this is weird to hear since they're normally much worse in this area.
3581,<|emo_disgust|> I'm literally screaming.
3582,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, it’s a horrible argument."
3583,<|emo_disgust|> A lot of these people don't want to be associated with the [NAME]. It's just a waste of time. Worst that a lot of these people are just ignorant and don't know what's best for their children.
3584,<|emo_disgust|> Why was he getting beaten in the open court so hard?
3585,<|emo_disgust|> It’s not even the worst when the worst part is you’re making an actual effort to be less judgmental.
3586,<|emo_disgust|> i can just get out i feel rude calling for the help
3587,<|emo_disgust|> Well.... fuck
3588,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck. That.
3590,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird, no. Some parents on here are weird, and some parents here are weird. "
3591,<|emo_disgust|> This is just unprofessional.
3592,<|emo_disgust|> i was so impressed with the quick turn around of the order the response time wasnt bad at all
3593,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm [NAME], but you're quite the opposite. I'm an optimistic and generous person, but a nasty one at that. "
3595,<|emo_disgust|> Holy fricking good
3596,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm a woman, so of course it's my turn to be disgusted by the male gaze."
3597,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking coward.
3598,<|emo_disgust|> The worst was the music.
3599,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] the shame
3600,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], your video stops."
3602,<|emo_disgust|> I'm angry.
3603,<|emo_disgust|> This is a weird thing to worry about.
3604,"<|emo_disgust|> Fuck it, I'll go get a M81 and a spare magazine case from the truck stop."
3605,<|emo_disgust|> She’s creepy
3606,<|emo_disgust|> But you better be! Cause in that weird world y'all can play the game w'aria > n00b community!
3608,<|emo_disgust|> i feel a little bit cranky but thats to be expected
3609,"<|emo_disgust|> There is no need to apologise, and do not tell any other person. Just stop."
3610,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fucking idiot for trusting her...
3612,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] why would you say that!!
3615,<|emo_disgust|> I love it when they all complain about too many streaming services...
3617,<|emo_disgust|> What a bummer. I was so looking forward to reading her account of her escape from her abusive husband.
3618,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing you can hear is that little girl crying in the background
3619,<|emo_disgust|> That's a bit odd
3620,<|emo_disgust|> Wow my heart!
3621,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, yeah. It's mostly for the worst guys."
3622,<|emo_disgust|> She's just going to look around for anybody to beat up she'll go out and rape anyway...
3623,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh wow. I almost forgot about this. Thanks for the point, OP. I'm a pretty new user to Reddit as well."
3624,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is awful on the road though. In today’s game he seemed to have a very bad night.
3625,<|emo_disgust|> So disgusting. Doesnt even deserve shame for that.
3626,<|emo_disgust|> He was. Really didn't seem to care.
3627,<|emo_disgust|> You have literally no ounce of shame.
3628,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, it's not illegal to post racist pics but it's much more difficult than just posting racist pics. Thanks for the information. "
3629,<|emo_disgust|> You need to start taking it a little more seriously. The music caught me off guard for some reason.
3630,<|emo_disgust|> And it’s not like other parents don't know [NAME] is sick. I just can’t believe the media and everyone is suddenly All of Our secrets.
3632,<|emo_disgust|> It seems pretty clear that you've lost some of your values as a person. How do you deal with that?
3634,"<|emo_disgust|> You've got no idea what fascism is, by any definition. /s"
3636,<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest thing is expecting a positive outcome from a relationship. It usually comes from a situation where neither one was willing or able to consistently improve.
3638,<|emo_disgust|> There seems to be a special place in Hell for drivers like you.
3639,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you ask a man to apologise for asking a woman to be less likely to end up in abusive relationships because of her sexual preference. That’s disgusting
3640,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, damn!"
3642,<|emo_disgust|> In a worst case scenario he could die of diarrhea.
3643,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck lacy is out. [NAME] is having a hell of a career year
3644,<|emo_disgust|> And that outfit is awful...
3645,<|emo_disgust|> I do hate this and I love you for sharing it
3646,<|emo_disgust|> But the bad part of the mirror is getting pissed.
3647,<|emo_disgust|> That last panel looks like total garbage.
3648,<|emo_disgust|> My worst fear is catching myself doing something id be proud of.
3649,"<|emo_disgust|> He’s a sexist, racist, homophobe, he should be outed to the world. "
3650,<|emo_disgust|> i feel tortured by that
3652,<|emo_disgust|> He is going to hate us.
3654,<|emo_disgust|> The worst of the bunch are the ones that pretend to be animal rights supporters to try and justify their awfulness.
3655,<|emo_disgust|> What a nasty goal
3656,<|emo_disgust|> But I hate [NAME] and I hate [NAME] even more now.
3658,<|emo_disgust|> That's how you get an arms race. Pre-emptive war in the Arabian Peninsula.
3659,<|emo_disgust|> That's just sick. Worst president ever.
3660,"<|emo_disgust|> Not a fan of his (Bishop) at all, but ok let him go and do it. "
3661,"<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting. Dried fruit is fine, but this is disgusting."
3662,<|emo_disgust|> i feel quite bitter about this but idk its still a fact
3663,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, how are they even trying these drugs? If they only help you with anxiety and depression they sure don't help with a productive life either."
3665,<|emo_disgust|> This is so disgusting. Can't imagine being this brain dead.
3667,<|emo_disgust|> It's pretty cringe.
3668,<|emo_disgust|> I am crying.
3669,<|emo_disgust|> She looked so uncomfortable in it.
3670,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] that's my favorite pakistani character
3671,"<|emo_disgust|> You just described my reality. Sad, isn't it?"
3672,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing is him just telling you that because he’s weirded out about something that's nothing.
3673,<|emo_disgust|> It is disgusting.
3675,<|emo_disgust|> I am angry at you.
3676,"<|emo_disgust|> The only problem I have with them is you get the ""we have no way of knowing what might go on in the mind of this old creep"" comment, btw."
3677,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Oh, by the way, is your boyfriend?"" "" bro?"" "
3678,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, I thought this same thing was about 5 feet high...6.5"
3680,<|emo_disgust|> The guy's a meat god. I'm sorry to hear that
3681,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] these are hideous
3682,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh no, the poor man"
3683,<|emo_disgust|> This is a weird thing to do.
3684,<|emo_disgust|> Oi he got stabbed in the eye
3685,<|emo_disgust|> The most pathetic thing that can possibly happen on this earth is to have a penis.
3686,<|emo_disgust|> I just can’t understand how the school system is allocating funding for this crap. I’m a public school teacher and it’s FUCKING WORSE
3689,<|emo_disgust|> They're so fucking stupid lol
3690,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, [NAME] made his money in the porn trade, where he didn't make a profit! How the hell did he manage to post that financial loss? "
3691,<|emo_disgust|> How dare they ask this of a ten year old?!?!?!?!
3692,<|emo_disgust|> This really fucked up my brain. I don't think I'll ever do that kind of stuff again
3693,<|emo_disgust|> You're a disgrace to the species
3694,<|emo_disgust|> I know a momma badger who lost both her parents to Alzheimer's. She took it very hard.
3695,<|emo_disgust|> The one from which all other porn is based. It's disgusting that you imagine this is not true.
3696,<|emo_disgust|> i dont feel left out im lucky
3697,"<|emo_disgust|> Those women are disgusting, and the men in them are mostly the best."
3698,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing scarier than a plane wreck is a completely surrounded by Turnberry's apple trees
3699,<|emo_disgust|> In the world of NHL all playoff groups are final for 3 series a year. That's ridiculous.
3702,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a very bad defender. He should be a First rounder at worst. 
3704,<|emo_disgust|> That's an ungodly amount of chonkers.
3705,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, she's lucky no one got hurt. That bouncer is a monster. "
3707,<|emo_disgust|> Oh gosh. That poor janitor.
3708,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] it's not a fucking movie
3709,"<|emo_disgust|> That sucks, good luck next time"
3710,<|emo_disgust|> This is scary.
3711,<|emo_disgust|> This was literally me!
3712,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is when it's something that you enjoy
3713,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] how horrible. I hated watching it but decided to check it out anyway because I care a lot about [NAME].
3714,<|emo_disgust|> Shut the fuck up [NAME].
3715,<|emo_disgust|> No because thats stupid
3716,"<|emo_disgust|> This is so true! I've thought about ways to get rid of them after a while, it's so awful."
3718,<|emo_disgust|> I have a deep seeded hatred for all humans
3719,<|emo_disgust|> This one was more painful than the last one.
3720,<|emo_disgust|> She’s horrible
3721,<|emo_disgust|> That fucking Mills charge is FUCKING BULLSHIT
3722,<|emo_disgust|> I feel you. I'm an idiot.
3723,<|emo_disgust|> The worst! At least you did your part to save him!
3724,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is worse.
3725,<|emo_disgust|> My parents are divorcee. I've never had a word spoken to me while they were apart.
3726,<|emo_disgust|> That was a brutal backside.
3727,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] said [NAME] doesn't deserve our votes. He's the worst OF our votes.
3729,<|emo_disgust|> Who da fuck wears swim trunks to a competition any longer
3731,"<|emo_disgust|> In which case, I’m done here. "
3733,<|emo_disgust|> She's got nothing to lose but your damn job!!
3734,<|emo_disgust|> That’s disgusting. I can’t imagine ever having done that. Worst thing is calling police to report an assault
3735,"<|emo_disgust|> Lol I'm just gonna go ahead and call bullshit everything that dude says. He's just a douchebag, there is no way he is an organ donationist. "
3737,"<|emo_disgust|> That was rude, what did you do next? It's better if it's caught by a security guard, since that will probably get him fired"
3738,<|emo_disgust|> I can't hear clearly but if [NAME] was a little girl then I'd be crying just watching this
3739,<|emo_disgust|> Sooo...yuck.
3740,"<|emo_disgust|> That sucks, good luck next time."
3741,"<|emo_disgust|> I can't stand the smell of burned incense in the morning, it's so bad!"
3742,<|emo_disgust|> Not true at all. I could get behind this but it would be so infuriating to watch someone do something that is so foolish
3743,<|emo_disgust|> I wonder if he thinks he might get caught.
3744,"<|emo_disgust|> I've heard too many horror stories about him, no matter how little I'm willing to put into it."
3746,<|emo_disgust|> Don't be so hard on yourself... we already had all this before!
3747,<|emo_disgust|> In those unfortunate few days I have only experienced terrible luck
3748,<|emo_disgust|> It's actually kinda creepy.
3749,<|emo_disgust|> What a strange way to say that. It's so weird.
3750,"<|emo_disgust|> No, you're a monster yourself!"
3751,<|emo_disgust|> Oh wow that's horrible. You're doing great dude. I'm [NAME]. We're here.
3752,<|emo_disgust|> If you don't think it needs to be more than 10% [NAME] your entire argument is worthless.
3753,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds awful. I'm sorry. Good luck with the diapers.
3754,"<|emo_disgust|> I’m not [calling anyone], I just hate seeing this kind of hate in here."
3755,<|emo_disgust|> Sooooo....yuck
3756,"<|emo_disgust|> Well we did it then, don't you think? I mean, what if you gave your kid a hot glug of toothpaste and just walked out "
3757,<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting. No one should act this way to you. :(
3758,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird that Reddit hates [NAME] so much...
3759,"<|emo_disgust|> This is one of those ""we need to find a way to deal with this issue and they are the ones getting angry"" bull sessions. I think it's pretty lame."
3761,<|emo_disgust|> What bothers me is that he didn't tell [NAME] to get off the couch. They need to get off the couch together.
3764,<|emo_disgust|> This whole thread is one of the dumbest things I've seen this week
3765,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird too. Not sure what you mean. I'm so happy for you. I hope you and your family are okay.
3766,<|emo_disgust|> He was a moron for trusting the democrats to fix anything. Go ask him about his healthcare record.
3767,<|emo_disgust|> My [NAME] I hate those.
3768,<|emo_disgust|> I was wondering the same thing but I don’t have the VCR or internet!
3770,<|emo_disgust|> That feels a little more realistic.
3771,<|emo_disgust|> F for our fallen comrade
3772,<|emo_disgust|> Man I don't know how we came here to talk about [NAME].
3773,<|emo_disgust|> We live in a society that prizes beauty above all else and we are all supposed to be either perfect or awful
3774,<|emo_disgust|> In the old days! One girl was found guilty and hung! The judge wasn‘t impressed!
3775,<|emo_disgust|> I would say watch their mouth. If you watch their mouth youve gotta be a pretty decent viewer to not believe it.
3777,"<|emo_disgust|> I'll be honest here, I didn't really know who [NAME] was at the time."
3779,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird that the only item I've tried that didn't leave me greasy was the old saucepanini with bacon bits
3780,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds horrible. :( I'm so sorry. You're an amazing person
3781,<|emo_disgust|> You're a freak
3782,<|emo_disgust|> i feel very very bitter and hateful towards them
3783,<|emo_disgust|> Man I am fucking starving here.
3784,"<|emo_disgust|> ""You're a bad parent for not telling them how often"""
3785,"<|emo_disgust|> If I’m [NAME], I’m waiting for a heart attack from watching all of this"
3786,<|emo_disgust|> Omg that was the WORST
3787,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. And she's not even attractive.
3788,<|emo_disgust|> I've heard horrible things. I've heard people who I would consider friends. I'd pay to have them assaulted
3789,"<|emo_disgust|> The world has always been about the wrong people. Those who oppress, manipulate and oppress in the name of profit are always the worst people."
3790,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is just an asshole sometimes he's so boorish it’s hilarious. But other than that he's a decent defender
3793,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn, that's one pissed off old hag. Some kind of counseling is in order. "
3794,"<|emo_disgust|> Don't worry I get it. Can't speak for other people, but I would just leave and not call or text them. "
3795,"<|emo_disgust|> You're a terrible human being for making that public, and an even worse person for spreading it."
3796,<|emo_disgust|> That’s disgusting.
3797,<|emo_disgust|> But how dare you put anything besides your face on a fucking poster for the 2019 World Cup?
3799,<|emo_disgust|> What. The. Fuck.
3800,<|emo_disgust|> He would then go on to argue with you for wanting to eat pizza every night. How cringe.
3801,<|emo_disgust|> How tf do you use your hands? I'd rather just throw them out there.
3802,"<|emo_disgust|> You think the woman was ""wearing heels"" to get assaulted? Idk, wearing boots is pretty bad."
3803,"<|emo_disgust|> It has nothing to do with me, but just to be able to pick and choose who I want to begy my self... "
3804,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh man, can you imagine if [NAME] won the lottery and got the lucky number 9? "
3806,<|emo_disgust|> They should get fired.
3808,<|emo_disgust|> Because sometimes I dont want to be watched.
3809,<|emo_disgust|> Because it's a shitty ad.
3811,<|emo_disgust|> He's an angry orange man
3812,<|emo_disgust|> It's extremely creepy.
3813,<|emo_disgust|> I think it's pretty safe to say she was pressured by her boyfriend to have an abortion.
3814,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is the worst manager I've ever seen.
3815,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, I want it to be a double!"
3816,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a miserable bolliwood
3817,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck this guy for making my day
3818,<|emo_disgust|> i am sorry that you feel the need to be cruel but there are so many people in this world that need our love too
3822,<|emo_disgust|> Lol I’m a woman and so are you. Shut up though.
3824,<|emo_disgust|> That’s a disgusting amount of Sesame oil.
3825,<|emo_disgust|> Your parents fucked up.
3827,<|emo_disgust|> I have no friends.
3828,<|emo_disgust|> Damn. That.
3830,"<|emo_disgust|> The problem they have is simple, they don’t want to ""prove"" that any one of their claims is wrong."
3831,<|emo_disgust|> That comment was so terrible
3832,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is so fucking handsome
3833,"<|emo_disgust|> The internet never disappoints, does it?"
3834,<|emo_disgust|> i feel disgusted by myself now so i would like to correct that and say why i feel disgusted by myself
3835,<|emo_disgust|> You're a cunt.
3836,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] it's him again
3837,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME] are all weird because if [NAME] was an actual person he just would be a strange shade of dark haired."
3838,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fat lard? Fuck off.
3839,<|emo_disgust|> My favorite is watching him get distracted by a tree
3843,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, that's so disgusting. The only thing worse than this is for your kids to grow up thinking that a life of sin and sorrow is normal."
3844,<|emo_disgust|> Lol dont tell mr brolobo
3845,"<|emo_disgust|> And worse after 40 years! After this, 40 years of continued bad, bad policy..."
3847,<|emo_disgust|> i feel very disgusted and disturbed by all that i heard tonight and the things i watched
3848,<|emo_disgust|> The last three years have seen a lot of growth for the hq fan base but there is still much work to be done. Fingers crossed for the future...
3851,<|emo_disgust|> This is me every damn time after the Allianz cup
3852,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you put x on the same level as [NAME]!/s
3853,<|emo_disgust|> This is awful. Im just gonna downvote and move on to the next sub. Youre toxic asf for posting this.
3854,<|emo_disgust|> Well she does talk a few words of Shite but hey thats what has been on her mind the whole time.
3855,<|emo_disgust|> i know the feeling of being watched
3857,<|emo_disgust|> It's pretty ridiculous how easily manipulated college students are.
3858,<|emo_disgust|> That's so disturbing. Are you with park services?
3859,<|emo_disgust|> And if that's the only problem I have I'm a fucking idiot
3861,<|emo_disgust|> This is so hateful. So wrong.
3862,<|emo_disgust|> He wanted to keep his clothes on until he went to his room to shower. That's weirdly creepy.
3863,<|emo_disgust|> I can't see her face...the way we are both looks so creepy...
3864,<|emo_disgust|> What?! She didn't even get a chance to say 'honey'! What a waste of time and effort.
3867,<|emo_disgust|> Why? What is your point? I’m so confused
3868,<|emo_disgust|> He looks hot. But he's not president.
3869,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like im making a point to call anyone who makes a big deal out of being offended the wrong kind
3871,<|emo_disgust|> I really hate this. This is so infuriating.
3872,<|emo_disgust|> And how awful that they're paying for their own funerals
3873,<|emo_disgust|> Man I feel like the only one to blame for the constant jam of broken plays on tv and radio:
3874,"<|emo_disgust|> I've had two sclerosis medications, and though I'm old, it still makes me sick to get stoned like it does every once in a while"
3875,"<|emo_disgust|> It would actually give the appearance of impropriety given the circumstances, which is even worse."
3876,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm not surprised the guy had a bad experience, he certainly doesn't deserve a free ride."
3877,<|emo_disgust|> i feel extremely dissatisfied with my life right now
3878,<|emo_disgust|> You don't know shit about world history and religion and even your own father knows shit about fucking history and religion don’t you?
3879,"<|emo_disgust|> We have no idea what these guys are talking about either, but the tone is shockingly tone deaf."
3880,<|emo_disgust|> The title of it is kinda creepy.
3881,<|emo_disgust|> Your wife is a slut.
3882,<|emo_disgust|> Just get the hell out now!
3883,<|emo_disgust|> > It's a bit weird coming from [NAME] I understand that but this is still news to me. Thanks dude.
3885,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like im a selfish greedy and complacent human
3886,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst news I have heard all season.
3887,<|emo_disgust|> My friends swear the universe hates us.
3888,<|emo_disgust|> When she said “I thought I was going to die because I hated my body” I didn’t feel very sympathetic.
3889,<|emo_disgust|> Because some people think it is rude to use certain words with a dash of “french”. Like “fuck” and “knot”
3890,<|emo_disgust|> I didn’t know I’d be that far off.
3891,<|emo_disgust|> This comment is a prime example of the death threats that certain individuals on /r/KotakuInAction receive. Get rid of this type of people now.
3892,"<|emo_disgust|> Worst case scenario is an ugly 3-2 start. Very inconsistent, and don't even pretend the goals were even on net."
3893,<|emo_disgust|> I thought you said that about the dude's head. Wasn't surprised to hear it looked like a damn penis
3894,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was never a particularly strong defender
3895,<|emo_disgust|> I’m an idiot.
3896,<|emo_disgust|> You're a disgusting piece!
3897,<|emo_disgust|> That was beyond disgusting. The level ofancy in those ads is just absolutely astounding.
3900,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] that was the WORST
3901,"<|emo_disgust|> You have to get out of bed for this, otherwise you'll get worse, worse, worse. "
3902,<|emo_disgust|> Man I hate them too. They're just.... I hate them so much it literally makes me sick.
3903,"<|emo_disgust|> That's a shame, I'd be surprised if he's too busy ruining his family to do anything besides murder everyone around him"
3904,"<|emo_disgust|> The fuck? [NAME] has had 1,000 days in the league, [NAME] has had 2,000. Get the fuck off our property."
3905,<|emo_disgust|> They’re ugly.
3907,<|emo_disgust|> He is in his late 80s but looks younger.
3908,"<|emo_disgust|> Who exactly are you loyal democrats and why do you support such a corrupting and authoritarian party? If you are loyal, you should leave."
3909,"<|emo_disgust|> My wife's birthday today, she'll be 59 in August and I'm 64. You're both shocked this works..."
3910,<|emo_disgust|> This is literally infuriating.
3912,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, is that true? I’d love to see more on that."
3913,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I'm so sorry. You had a heck of a life.
3914,<|emo_disgust|> You just don't know how to pick your battles. I think [NAME] was just having a bad day
3915,<|emo_disgust|> And he still has not managed to recoup. No wonder he has not resigned.
3918,<|emo_disgust|> That's horrible. People there do have a lot of selfless people but that's just not what the game is about.
3919,"<|emo_disgust|> If she said he didn't like her, then he had nothing to do with it either."
3920,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm really not sure. I really should not link to them in this thread, but I just wanted to warn you. "
3921,<|emo_disgust|> Oh fuck off.
3922,<|emo_disgust|> They’re a weird couple
3923,"<|emo_disgust|> And there I said I liked them all equally, now I hate them all equally!"
3924,<|emo_disgust|> This is almost worse than the guy who killed [NAME]
3925,<|emo_disgust|> What a douche.
3927,<|emo_disgust|> The worst was an attempt to hide the number of times he had sex with the girl on his team. He didn't have a problem admitting he had sex once with a young girl. 
3928,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm not your friend, you have no right to call me friend and just ban me for posting anything about [NAME] or any other pro-discrimination issue for that matter"
3929,<|emo_disgust|> Man oh man...
3930,<|emo_disgust|> Now that’s wild
3931,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Why everyone hurts me? I have a plan!"""
3932,<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting. He should be embarrassed.
3933,<|emo_disgust|> That would take a lot of guts for him to say that.
3934,<|emo_disgust|> He can’t even do anything about it since [NAME] is in his personal control
3935,<|emo_disgust|> What a waste of bottlecap.
3936,<|emo_disgust|> This video makes me want to die
3937,"<|emo_disgust|> When people use those words it’s racist, sexist, and objectifying."
3938,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm in my 20s, still getting my ass handed to me by my parents for 2k alone. "
3939,<|emo_disgust|> There is a difference between an idea and a plan.
3941,<|emo_disgust|> He is just mad.
3942,<|emo_disgust|> Because it's funny and terrible
3943,<|emo_disgust|> What a disgusting read.
3944,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird way to say ""boyfriend""."
3945,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird. I feel about as homesick for Israel as I do for Florida.
3946,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you ask a proven liar a question about his evidence! /s
3947,<|emo_disgust|> That's pretty damn creepy.
3948,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck it let's get a fake number
3950,<|emo_disgust|> I’m sorry you just had a bad experience with that site. I’m glad you made your way to another.
3951,<|emo_disgust|> Those ears...those horrible ears...excuse me while I *burn* these ears out
3952,<|emo_disgust|> What an idiot lol
3953,"<|emo_disgust|> It's the ""I have no idea what [NAME] is"" crowd. Lmfao."
3955,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting. Im now a task force member and this just makes me want to die.
3956,"<|emo_disgust|> If I have a bad day, I'll just lie on my bed and read a book for an hour or two... Sounds weird, but it works. "
3957,"<|emo_disgust|> In this day and age, you gotta let people know if they're wrong and you dont let people know they're wrong."
3958,"<|emo_disgust|> The only thing worse than this is a law that would indeed allow this, not a law we need to avoid"
3960,<|emo_disgust|> We should've lost here. [NAME] missed three of his six field goals from the field.
3961,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is to think it has any future
3962,<|emo_disgust|> This sounds extremely similar to what happened to me at a Kossi's in Chicago back indays heyday
3963,<|emo_disgust|> I get the burn but holy hell I feel bad for her. I don't see her for who she is.
3964,<|emo_disgust|> You're going to get your ass kicked by a lioness
3966,"<|emo_disgust|> He is an impressionable, easily manipulated child. Yes, but I doubt he is any worse than most impressionable kids."
3967,<|emo_disgust|> That doesn’t make any sense. Have you seen any of that other shit or are you just too dumb to even look?
3968,<|emo_disgust|> i feel really greedy though and feel like i could eat a lot on the way back home and have waste made up before
3969,<|emo_disgust|> We just don’t do these deals anymore tbh the rotten apples come through the back door anyway.
3970,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] and these kids can't play? How dare you bully these kids because of their parents??? Man, I find it hard to imagine life without these people."
3972,"<|emo_disgust|> He is terrible at some things, but not awful at others."
3974,<|emo_disgust|> What the hell is [NAME] doing in a boardroom with all this power and utter hypocrisy?
3976,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], the fuck? He's not even a conservative. You're a bigot and an idiot for using your supposed First Amendment power to attack conservatives. "
3977,"<|emo_disgust|> That’s just...sad. You can’t change those people, but you can change the general population. "
3978,"<|emo_disgust|> Because you, the reader are stupid."
3979,<|emo_disgust|> It's a horrible meme.
3980,<|emo_disgust|> That scene traumatized me the first time I watched it
3981,<|emo_disgust|> You're not wrong in saying that a lot of people are afraid to tell them wrong.
3983,"<|emo_disgust|> Weirdly, though, no one seems to mind if I take pictures of their dogs."
3984,"<|emo_disgust|> And yes, she's very much a career politician. Not a working class one mind you."
3985,<|emo_disgust|> I don't think so. There is obviously a lot more work necessary.
3986,<|emo_disgust|> i feel less bitchy then
3987,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry you had to deal with that, you can do anything if you put enough thought and effort into it."
3988,"<|emo_disgust|> He’s such a greedy, gluttonous, lazy, envious, and spiteful man."
3989,<|emo_disgust|> Oh damn. Did not know they used generic colors.
3990,<|emo_disgust|> I still can't believe they let [NAME] walk. Not even the best of the worst were willing to let him go
3991,"<|emo_disgust|> I thought he was best boy, and he hated me"
3992,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn, if a guy that age doesn't know better, maybe I shouldn't be friends with him..."
3993,"<|emo_disgust|> That’s awful. Thanks for the correction, OP. 💍"
3994,<|emo_disgust|> I don't know if you know this but [NAME] is the god awful [NAME]
3995,"<|emo_disgust|> Just do it, if he's that bothered by the title then maybe it can be an issue."
3996,<|emo_disgust|> I mean we all know they got banned at the same time for similar comments
3998,<|emo_disgust|> If you feel that way about the Saints then you likely aren't ready for a rational argument.
3999,<|emo_disgust|> How DARE you challenge the accepted wisdom of man! /s
4000,<|emo_disgust|> The thing that worries me about this more than anything is that this was essentially airdropped from airdropped.
4001,"<|emo_disgust|> This is an example of the worst I've seen on this subreddit. Not sure if the post is on reddit or not, but seriously disgusting."
4002,<|emo_disgust|> I don't particularly like his handle
4003,"<|emo_disgust|> You're a freak, you dirty dog you."
4004,<|emo_disgust|> The third period is going to be uncomfortable for sure. I’m not from Chicago so I don’t have much in the way of experience. That will be a test to see if there is room for improvement.
4005,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME]. Don't you know it's ridiculous how often you're wrong
4006,<|emo_disgust|> The first comment was a little too aggressive.
4007,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is awful
4008,<|emo_disgust|> I really can't be the only one that thinks she's a sex monster.
4010,<|emo_disgust|> I feel tortured by this
4011,<|emo_disgust|> So edgy.
4012,<|emo_disgust|> And there I was blaming development for all of that.
4013,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is also crazy in other ways. His mom is hisOTHEROTHER GIRLNAME from high school... and she is a SHEETDA HEARTS HER OW ONLY FUCKING SCREEN SHOES
4014,<|emo_disgust|> How is it racist? It's not about [RELIGION] though. What bothers me is his lack of empathy.
4015,<|emo_disgust|> What a weird post omg
4016,<|emo_disgust|> Not at all. It was a pretty nasty exchange.
4017,<|emo_disgust|> You are a disgusting human being.
4018,<|emo_disgust|> This is really creepy. Is there a way to turn off background audio in the Not interested post?
4019,"<|emo_disgust|> I get the same, anxiety is just a natural reaction to having no control over your situation. That usually gets me off more than anything."
4021,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so hated
4022,"<|emo_disgust|> That's not an update? That's a shitty rework. I want to say I'm shocked but I'm not. Disgusted, but not shocked."
4023,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a hungry little bastard.
4025,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing I hate more than cancer is ignorance.
4026,"<|emo_disgust|> This thread is a hotbed for [RELIGION] hate, and the people who call on for that hate are pretty vocal."
4028,<|emo_disgust|> Who cares? That sucks.
4029,"<|emo_disgust|> Fuck it, I'll go find myself a bottle ofotex at the post office tomorrow"
4030,"<|emo_disgust|> If my parents had to live down the road from there, I wouldn't be surprised if I eventually settled down in Nashville."
4031,<|emo_disgust|> This person has no clue what being racist is.
4033,<|emo_disgust|> He wanted to get rich so he could fuck his mother. Kind of a weird way to look at things
4034,<|emo_disgust|> i feel wronged by not giving a damn about this
4036,"<|emo_disgust|> How dare you ask a child to ""step out of his box"" for you! You step on toes! Get outta here!"
4037,<|emo_disgust|> The weird eyes. The expression of surprise on his face. That face.
4038,<|emo_disgust|> Oh no.
4039,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, we gave [NAME] a contract like 10 years ago and he never fulfilled it. We could have gotten him back for 1B value"
4040,<|emo_disgust|> That's really creepy. I bet she'd be furious if she found out what sort of career she picked.
4041,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I'm so sorry for your loss.
4042,"<|emo_disgust|> Fuckin' fascinating, [NAME] "
4043,<|emo_disgust|> That's not really a vote of confidence in the coach or the program. That's a dumbscrum vote of confidence in the student body.
4045,"<|emo_disgust|> She should's get off, she's a publicist, lawyer and a friend of mine."
4046,<|emo_disgust|> I'm wondering the same thing...
4047,"<|emo_disgust|> So you're a liar, what's your problem? "
4048,<|emo_disgust|> This is a very public post and you have posted it public you idiot. You should expect this to never end well but you've posted it public it's a red flag.
4049,<|emo_disgust|> A little girl was assaulted on a busy street in broad daylight
4050,"<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest part about how she talks is how convinced she is that she doesn't love you, despite being 1,000 calories over weight "
4052,<|emo_disgust|> Fuuuuck. Yes.
4053,<|emo_disgust|> i always feel so fucked up when i listen to him
4055,"<|emo_disgust|> And I hate that I'm here to tell you that you don't need to listen to her angry ranting, it's all so smug. "
4056,<|emo_disgust|> It'll hurt
4057,<|emo_disgust|> She literally is the worst manager that I have worked for.
4058,<|emo_disgust|> I'll always be here to accept you.... Just ask
4060,<|emo_disgust|> The new faces in the poster are terrible.
4061,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] whyyyyy is this still not banned
4062,<|emo_disgust|> I am going to die right now.
4063,<|emo_disgust|> This is not cute. This is creepy.
4064,<|emo_disgust|> In what else am I doing? Get some help!
4065,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], what a fuckin n"
4066,"<|emo_disgust|> When you're a horrible person, it's hard to point out the good points."
4067,<|emo_disgust|> I remember looking at a copy of Time magazine and feeling very disgusted by the cover.
4068,<|emo_disgust|> It’s creepy and weird but also pretty damn good
4069,<|emo_disgust|> And when it’s broken most of the time it’s incredibly infuriating. People need to learn their lesson. 
4070,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck me daddy
4071,<|emo_disgust|> That is deeply disgusting. Those leaders should be thoroughly embarrassed.
4072,<|emo_disgust|> He looks like he's about to be drag race with that face
4073,<|emo_disgust|> The last thing I want on my team is [NAME] and [NAME]
4074,<|emo_disgust|> I am getting an awful lot of weird replies...
4075,<|emo_disgust|> She just wants to be left alone. Wait a fucking second.
4076,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] really thought he was the one who shot [NAME]?!
4077,<|emo_disgust|> This is a terrible idea and is completely unnecessary
4078,<|emo_disgust|> Not a very good argument for keeping the prison open.
4079,<|emo_disgust|> I’m just going to put the whole sundae thing in perspective for you. It’s not even weird.
4080,<|emo_disgust|> The only acceptable excuse is that the rape kit test results came back negative.
4081,<|emo_disgust|> This is creepy and weird.
4082,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]. I'm just a guy on Reddit. How many Reddit redditors have to die before you are taken into consideration?
4083,<|emo_disgust|> So glad to hear that. I’m worried about that too.
4084,"<|emo_disgust|> If you are that concerned and do want to see videos of it, the only way is to visit with a tour guide. In any case it’s too damn creepy to leave."
4085,<|emo_disgust|> How awful. Those kids are so young. Their parents need to be held accountable.
4086,<|emo_disgust|> I feel for you. I hope you have a wonderful life and that the abuse you experienced doesn't happen to you again.
4088,<|emo_disgust|> I hate taking pictures of people taking public Transport for granted. Please do more.
4089,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is always the dirtiest psychopath
4090,<|emo_disgust|> What a dumbing down of what seems to be so many well thought out stories by [NAME]. You can't just pick things out.
4091,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, it just makes all the other articles ridiculous."
4092,<|emo_disgust|> You cant get divorced from someone for dating them. Unless they are using it as an excuse to never fuck again.
4093,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a little jealous.
4094,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird.
4095,"<|emo_disgust|> You're telling us to give them more money because they're ""important"" doesn't get it? That's an old, old mentality."
4097,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is so afraid to lose that is beyond fucking BOTH! Fuck off with your bullshit whining and childish name calling.
4098,<|emo_disgust|> i feel really stressed out
4100,<|emo_disgust|> This is so disgusting I literally am speechless.
4101,<|emo_disgust|> Damn no I was just joking.
4102,<|emo_disgust|> I really miss AG
4103,<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell thought he was dead...
4104,<|emo_disgust|> She’s not your friend. Stop using that insulting and sexist phraseologies. She’s a nasty little hatter.
4105,<|emo_disgust|> How dare they remind us what our sacrifice was! /s
4106,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck this team!
4107,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit did you just use the N-word again?
4108,<|emo_disgust|> Not exactly what it's cracked up to be.
4110,<|emo_disgust|> i could not help feeling that at least in my own mind the most innocent but apparently most dangerous thing i could think of was that they could make me do anything
4111,<|emo_disgust|> The internet is actually being�sassy now.
4112,<|emo_disgust|> The amount of fake news that is shared on social media is shockingly high.
4113,<|emo_disgust|> Oh good lord. They’re awful at their jobs.
4115,"<|emo_disgust|> The worst is the ""it's cute"" girl. That's just mean."
4116,<|emo_disgust|> This is just awful.
4117,<|emo_disgust|> He is one. It is unfortunate that we do not have full fledged fledglings at the moment
4118,<|emo_disgust|> How many of us do you kill in a bayonet assault?
4119,<|emo_disgust|> This is creepy and weird. Do you have any idea how many times this has been said?
4120,<|emo_disgust|> Wow this is some of the worst pass rush I've ever seen.
4121,<|emo_disgust|> It’s disgusting that we can’t see that the garbage is being moved around and the floor is being kept clean
4122,<|emo_disgust|> He said im being rude i want to stop
4128,<|emo_disgust|> The only dull moment in this movie was when the womanising miser walks towards the camera and asks if he wants some cake.
4130,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck no i wish i knew!
4132,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, no one to blame here, the poor boat. "
4133,<|emo_disgust|> I will never understand why we need another 10 bb to fill the DH. That's all you have fucking 6 bb
4134,<|emo_disgust|> i just feel very disgusted by human suffering
4135,<|emo_disgust|> He must smell terrible in there. Like rotten eggs.
4136,"<|emo_disgust|> In other words, go to a movie or go outside if you’m hot. Your social life’s over."
4137,<|emo_disgust|> The secondhand panic and embarrassment I feel from this is simply terrifying.
4138,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]. I just can't stand that we aren’t getting guys who can bang their wives.
4139,<|emo_disgust|> The only guy that didn’t say his pizza was hot.
4140,"<|emo_disgust|> It's weird that [NAME] has more experience in this area than him, seems a bit high-maintenance "
4141,<|emo_disgust|> I have a feeling she is. Was she a model? Have you seen her work? She is ugly
4142,<|emo_disgust|> No I'd rather be friends with jerks than friends with people who don't let you act like a human being
4143,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, fuck off."
4144,<|emo_disgust|> I will die.
4145,"<|emo_disgust|> It would be weird to see the person as [NAME], the only person who has seen these films!"
4146,<|emo_disgust|> It's such a stupid thing to say.
4147,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, it's *my* fault for using shitty POS systems all throughout the years, you dumb, ignorant piece of shit. "
4148,<|emo_disgust|> He is quite possibly the most useless manager in United CFNT history
4149,"<|emo_disgust|> I do think there needs to be more transgender people in the military, as per the article."
4150,<|emo_disgust|> I see you've watched The Mummy. How disgusting.
4151,<|emo_disgust|> This doesn't help at all but is frustrating.
4152,<|emo_disgust|> She could have said that and any of that would have made me angry and upset
4153,"<|emo_disgust|> That's worse than the original, I'm sorry your experience was so awful."
4154,<|emo_disgust|> That’s horrible🤣😂
4155,<|emo_disgust|> It happens more often than you think. People are repulsive.
4156,"<|emo_disgust|> I think ""I don't care"" is a more appropriate response. That said, I would be very reluctant to divorce my husband because of our ""I don't want kids with him anymore"" conversation. "
4157,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that you called me a mofo and began talking trash about me was weird.
4158,<|emo_disgust|> They're just wingers. ( Unless you're a virgin)
4159,"<|emo_disgust|> And now [NAME] and [NAME] are ruining the Pittsburgh Steelers culture. Unlucky, truly."
4160,<|emo_disgust|> Oh geez [NAME] is awful
4161,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I'm not expecting to find a use for that.
4163,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, I'm not a fan but I'll support this if it's for good. "
4164,<|emo_disgust|> This is like the 2nd or 3rd worst post I've read on here in a while.
4165,"<|emo_disgust|> We're not worse than the Taliban, just we're a lot worse. "
4166,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like a horrible person for loving you too
4167,<|emo_disgust|> They’re so scared
4168,<|emo_disgust|> And you wonder why she killed herself?
4169,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking dipshit.
4170,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was never a conservative. He was Never an isolationist, he was a strong believer in free trade."
4171,"<|emo_disgust|> It is weird because I do this, I love it"
4172,"<|emo_disgust|> I'd say [RELIGION] is basically an extreme form of Nazism, and it's a problem in itself."
4173,<|emo_disgust|> You’re an awful person.
4174,<|emo_disgust|> It would be weird to have both aleft and right hand driver so imagine a game where both need to play
4175,"<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell thought he was dead, seriously looks like he just run into the road like a bumper sticker."
4176,<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting. Not to mention she's barely 14.
4177,"<|emo_disgust|> I have lost count of the number of times he has done this, ""I didn't know it was a boll weg"" "
4179,<|emo_disgust|> But I’d rather not have to spend a year in college to learn them!
4180,<|emo_disgust|> It's amazing how quickly people forgot [NAME] terrible 2014 season
4181,<|emo_disgust|> In Canada it’s not rare to find people posting in this sub that have deep buried depression or maybe even rage issues. So many people have it.
4183,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck im sleepin on reddit wtf
4184,<|emo_disgust|> Now all I can hear are loud hollers from the lockers.
4185,<|emo_disgust|> Who's fucking a bear!
4187,<|emo_disgust|> That was truly disgusting reading.
4188,<|emo_disgust|> Oh no wonder everyone hates [NAME].
4189,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, it would be weird to use words like that in a gaming context. "
4190,<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck?
4191,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, goodness!"
4192,<|emo_disgust|> He’s so awkward with his “stache”
4193,"<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing he said was: ""I don't want your car."""
4195,<|emo_disgust|> I want someone to do this for me
4196,<|emo_disgust|> You were also found guilty of conspiracy to commit identity theft. How is that not a crime?
4197,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that's gotta cut deep.
4199,<|emo_disgust|> When I was his age I had one too.
4200,"<|emo_disgust|> But if it’s true, what’s wrong with him? Looks so virtuous. What’s wrong with [NAME]? "
4201,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, it's none of your business!"
4202,<|emo_disgust|> That's a bit inappropriate for a UK Prime Minister.
4203,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, I thought it was that you liked your job."
4205,<|emo_disgust|> He is the worst coach in bulls history. One of the worst ever.
4206,"<|emo_disgust|> Holy crap that's bad, good to know [NAME] is alright."
4207,<|emo_disgust|> They’re disgusting people inside and out
4209,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, those dreadful things. You could easily get them shaken down."
4210,"<|emo_disgust|> It's actually worse than I feared. The top image has the worst captions, and reddit comments are getting super bad. "
4211,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm an animal lover but I'm also a human being, so fuck that. "
4212,<|emo_disgust|> You’re a scum bag
4213,<|emo_disgust|> That's beyond fucking creepy.
4214,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I like being the first guy that gets kicked off a flight for saying ""fuck it"""
4215,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, it's a shitty suit with bad teeth."
4216,<|emo_disgust|> I could have written this. That's a terrible piece of writing.
4217,<|emo_disgust|> So much fake news
4221,<|emo_disgust|> It has been a weird month.
4222,<|emo_disgust|> You're an idiot.
4223,<|emo_disgust|> This is just awful
4224,<|emo_disgust|> Oh this poor sap
4225,<|emo_disgust|> Not the most unpleasant thing to read on the internet.
4226,<|emo_disgust|> The saddest thing is that she thought making a political stand on behalf of a foreign power was a cool thing to do!
4227,<|emo_disgust|> I was having a hard time caring as it felt like I just let myself go. 
4228,<|emo_disgust|> Weird shit i just watched
4229,<|emo_disgust|> Oh that's so sad. What a good dog she is.
4230,<|emo_disgust|> They really just go to a bar or something where there's probably people with guns/drugs/eyebrow waxing/pissing. Very awkward and awkward.
4231,<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting. If the woman is 34 is it any surprise that she's using fake information to bully and harass people?
4232,<|emo_disgust|> Your a fucking idiot lol
4233,<|emo_disgust|> It's honestly almost terrifying. In the US it would be illegal for a dairy farm to knowingly feed animals. A UK dairy farm could be found guilty of knowingly feeding animals
4234,"<|emo_disgust|> Ouch, that hurt bad"
4235,<|emo_disgust|> The way that [NAME] is handling it is disgusting. Biting the hand that feeds them
4236,<|emo_disgust|> When [NAME] insulted [NAME] by saying [NAME] was a [NAME].. he started screaming AND groaning like a little girl.
4237,<|emo_disgust|> This could have possibly been a great idea if it was something you did... I mean...
4238,<|emo_disgust|> How dare someone call their dog dumb!
4239,<|emo_disgust|> This is so disgusting. One small Turd burger to close out a bad week.
4240,<|emo_disgust|> Holy crap that was beautiful
4242,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] looks a little stressed out. I think he should ask her not to tell his parents.
4243,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is waiting 6 months for a relationship and then not being interested. It's so frustrating
4244,<|emo_disgust|> Now that's weird.
4245,"<|emo_disgust|> That sounds awful. I'm so sorry you had to go through that kind of abuse, but there is no place like home for the abuse you experienced."
4246,"<|emo_disgust|> Fuck it, let's do it."
4249,<|emo_disgust|> I hope this is a joke. I hate social outcasts.
4250,<|emo_disgust|> It was made while the CFF was looking into a number of sexual harassment claims. It's terrible.
4251,<|emo_disgust|> And there I said it.
4252,"<|emo_disgust|> No, these are all ways to make the reader feel bad"
4253,"<|emo_disgust|> I was there yesterday, and even I was amazed at the number of drunkards and youth, hitchinghipping and bartering in the streets for their bits and bits of illegal drugs.."
4254,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so tortured and upset but its ok cause i know im wrong
4255,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah and the other option is a fascist USA. Not sure what the actual policy is.
4256,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fucking rapist, and you're all so fucking privileged and woke up that you think this comment is okay. Fuck off with your bullshit victim blaming"
4260,<|emo_disgust|> i feel wronged by the way the other person treats me they feel wronged by how i treat them
4262,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a weirdo.
4263,<|emo_disgust|> This is creepy and weird. Do you know what kind of toys to put over the sink?
4264,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I’d love to listen to them rip on each other!
4265,<|emo_disgust|> Your dog is so cute!
4266,<|emo_disgust|> That's worse than if someone shot at you just because you were passing.
4268,<|emo_disgust|> i would still feel annoyed
4269,<|emo_disgust|> That one's real [NAME]. He'll be pissed when you give him that.
4270,"<|emo_disgust|> If it's a man and a kid then it's a bit of a problem, because it could be the case that the man has gone off to get sex from the kid."
4271,<|emo_disgust|> I've had this problem from beginning to end. It keeps getting worse.
4272,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is wearing swim trunks to a competition
4273,"<|emo_disgust|> I love this, I wish this were true. It is so infuriating "
4274,<|emo_disgust|> i feel quite stressed to do the things i have to do
4276,<|emo_disgust|> That's horrible. I'm so sorry.
4277,<|emo_disgust|> I will never enough of [NAME] even when he looks bad
4278,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a bitch and i hate her
4281,<|emo_disgust|> He sounds like a bad cartoon to me
4282,<|emo_disgust|> Who did you report that to? I have no idea.
4283,<|emo_disgust|> I'm a [NAME] and I've been out here doing yard work for 30 years doing this. Please dont let your hatred and divisiveness consume you. You can do much better then this.
4285,<|emo_disgust|> That was so infuriating.
4288,<|emo_disgust|> He was. His wife is trying to pull his pants up in shame. How disgusting.
4289,"<|emo_disgust|> We don't know about [NAME] at all, so all we know is “it looked like [NAME] is a bit of a bimbo, which bodes ill for his election in 2020”"
4290,<|emo_disgust|> I feel horrible for these poor kids. I hope nothing happens to them.
4291,<|emo_disgust|> I want to be a teacher that lets my kids play inside my classroom.
4292,<|emo_disgust|> My condolences. Those are hideous.
4293,<|emo_disgust|> What a bitch! I'm so sorry that you had to go through such an awful roleplay.
4294,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, those dreadful things. They're called degloved tips."
4295,<|emo_disgust|> What is disgusting.
4297,"<|emo_disgust|> I mean it really would be difficult, but I'm not saying there isn't any way."
4298,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not a [NAME]. I'm a [RELIGION] [NAME].
4299,<|emo_disgust|> Your entire post is bullshit.
4300,<|emo_disgust|> Man fucking stop.
4301,<|emo_disgust|> Damn she is moody
4302,<|emo_disgust|> People who have watched this game would have also noticed that their starting forward got caught throwing a punch while being Tased.
4303,<|emo_disgust|> How dare he care about his physical and mental health when all he cares about is a fucking meme?
4304,<|emo_disgust|> They're right wingers not left wingers
4307,<|emo_disgust|> I hate that our natural environment is being destroyed at an rates unseen in human history. 
4309,<|emo_disgust|> That's an awful lot of goddamn dust.
4310,<|emo_disgust|> I’m angry that [NAME] isn’t a fan
4311,"<|emo_disgust|> No I did not, I LOVE NITARA"
4312,<|emo_disgust|> There are enough disgustingries bagel cakes and such in Cantina everyday to disgusted even a casual Cantina customer.
4313,"<|emo_disgust|> Now I know I’m being rude to you, but [NAME] has made many different movies. "
4314,<|emo_disgust|> It was a terrible open shot. And a terrible2nds 3.2. Those are terrible numbers
4315,<|emo_disgust|> The worst case of what I've experienced
4316,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is also on fire. He's getting anOTHER five this game. Stay calm baby
4317,<|emo_disgust|> i hate fags and faggots for the exact reasons that im going to be making a separate post about right now.
4319,"<|emo_disgust|> Just go right ahead, if you think it’s creepy then it is. "
4320,"<|emo_disgust|> This is the saddest thing I've read today, and I've been reading at work lately so not just me."
4321,<|emo_disgust|> You're a piece of shit lmao
4322,<|emo_disgust|> He’s a moron.
4323,<|emo_disgust|> > It's hard to give an honest opinion on a topic which has so many opinions. Get a fuckin background check.
4324,"<|emo_disgust|> That's ridiculous. You can't see he's pregnant though. Also, [NAME] is at the hospital. That might explain most of it, I think..."
4325,<|emo_disgust|> I’d be creeped out.
4327,<|emo_disgust|> Well that was disheartening.
4328,<|emo_disgust|> It hurts that your friends think you're a monster
4329,<|emo_disgust|> Oh no...
4330,<|emo_disgust|> It's the worst when the customer is a stranger.
4331,<|emo_disgust|> This was a hate crime. Cut and dried.
4333,"<|emo_disgust|> It's very hard to find good vegan memes right now. This is my problem, and you're not helped by them. "
4334,<|emo_disgust|> Man I hate everything about this.
4336,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] does not deserve the vote....vote no to him
4337,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I would love to be a fly on your wall but I can’t right now
4338,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn that is an ugly 4.
4339,<|emo_disgust|> Oh wow Thats definitely something
4340,<|emo_disgust|> He was a horrible president. I wish him nothing but the best.
4341,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] fucking [NAME]. Your video is horrible as usual
4342,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry, what country?"
4343,<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting. Can't even imagine thinking that's even slightly OK.
4344,"<|emo_disgust|> No, but I wish he’s a girl. What a weird character to use for something like this"
4345,<|emo_disgust|> That’s what I’m worried about tonight
4346,<|emo_disgust|> > And some people think it's disgusting that a business owner posts a picture of his junk on his social media pages Is that worse?
4347,<|emo_disgust|> This is sick.
4348,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, there was a ton of ""Hmmm, I can't believe this is real LOL"" in that thread. "
4349,<|emo_disgust|> That's what I was wondering too. Was there any other news or anything posted on /r/Tulip either?
4350,<|emo_disgust|> I’m pretty good at making friends...
4351,<|emo_disgust|> This is one of the worst I've seen. The artist just can't draw him with [NAME] or [NAME] look.
4352,<|emo_disgust|> Damn it!
4353,"<|emo_disgust|> No, but it's a very worrying lack of preparedness I've noticed in some train drivers. They seem to struggle mightily with the knowledge that they are killing and maiming vulnerable people all the time."
4354,<|emo_disgust|> I swear this is the most aggravated take I've ever heard on this thread...
4355,<|emo_disgust|> What the Fuck did I just read
4356,<|emo_disgust|> That’s just sad and disgusting. VWP
4357,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting. If you think it makes any sense you're a weirdo.
4358,"<|emo_disgust|> It's almost 2017 now, I haven't lost a game in a month "
4359,<|emo_disgust|> i mean im not feeling so hateful it s like im just annoyed
4360,<|emo_disgust|> That day was one of the worst things i’ve ever seen an animal do. Now that’s just...I hate everything ABOUT nature.
4361,<|emo_disgust|> Holy fuck.
4362,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] said yesterday it was extremely rude and uncomfortable to be so rude and uncomfortable to your mommy and dad. Can't stand that lifestyle.
4363,<|emo_disgust|> You’re an awful troll.
4364,<|emo_disgust|> I really just hated the whole thing
4365,<|emo_disgust|> And that’s all the clothes on him??
4367,"<|emo_disgust|> >[NAME] would probably never, ever be ok with that. You're gross"
4368,<|emo_disgust|> My friends I have met in overcome cancer have told me about how amazing it is to have someone who knows how
4370,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] looks hella hideous
4371,<|emo_disgust|> Omg [NAME] was horrible
4372,<|emo_disgust|> But [NAME] is worse lol
4373,<|emo_disgust|> Who is that other guy?
4374,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking serious.
4375,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird that everyone is talking about it so much but there is really concern.
4376,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like they deserve fault in my eyes but it's only because theyre the people i hate
4377,"<|emo_disgust|> This is like the story of [NAME], that show and Reddit is fucking destroying the tv industry"
4380,<|emo_disgust|> Why is it socially acceptable to have an opinionated opinionated Reddit account?
4381,<|emo_disgust|> That is absolutely disgusting. What a disgrace to UK politics.
4382,<|emo_disgust|> But we should probably try to be better about it... I'm stubborn and I won't back down.
4383,<|emo_disgust|> I feel personally attacked by this pic
4385,"<|emo_disgust|> Those are the words ""hater"" and ""defender"" should be. He is a bigot and a racist."
4386,<|emo_disgust|> Damn.. I would have liked this
4387,"<|emo_disgust|> Shut up [NAME], you accustomed pair of socks with a pair of tennis shoes!"
4388,<|emo_disgust|> When do we get a new main character [NAME]? I like the supporting cast great but Idk the whole main thing sucks
4389,<|emo_disgust|> Lol your parents are assholes.
4390,<|emo_disgust|> i want to feel disgusted by myself
4391,<|emo_disgust|> No not funny just sad
4392,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah. You get a lot of weird requests from the same people, usually because they don't want to get in trouble."
4393,<|emo_disgust|> My favorite gusgasm...
4395,<|emo_disgust|> It sounds spasticated but I do it.
4398,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, if you look at the population properly, it's much, much worse..."
4399,<|emo_disgust|> He’s evil
4400,"<|emo_disgust|> The top comment says it all. ""You're disgusting and your family should be ashamed."""
4401,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, I don't see the issue and that's a big no-no."
4402,<|emo_disgust|> Soooooo yes.
4404,<|emo_disgust|> I can get arrested for making eye contact with women who have just had sex with someone else.
4405,<|emo_disgust|> You cant make up something that is so bad to someone just because you're a asshole.
4407,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, look! The real bad news. It's all really just a matter of time until he finally finds his way!"
4408,<|emo_disgust|> They are crazy
4409,<|emo_disgust|> But the media can't hide it any longer! It's all out war propaganda!
4410,<|emo_disgust|> >You are literally the worst kind of person. anon
4412,<|emo_disgust|> Man I hate text speak.
4413,<|emo_disgust|> That was vicious.
4414,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Hands up don't shoot"" ""Hands up don't shoot"" ""*I'll hurt you if you do it again*"""
4416,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] are the dumbest.
4417,"<|emo_disgust|> I hope not, I’m afraid it is."
4418,<|emo_disgust|> i feel angry to see you angry
4419,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a very interesting subject. I’ve sat in her classroom a couple of times. Very intelligent but extremely loud.
4421,"<|emo_disgust|> I didn't see that, is theres the link I use?"
4422,<|emo_disgust|> That's not the best picture. But I will not apologise.
4423,<|emo_disgust|> He looks like he’s trying to swallow a rotten apple
4424,<|emo_disgust|> It was the worst night of my life
4425,<|emo_disgust|> Don't put that stupid looking [NAME] in the same class as [NAME] or [NAME] and waste yourtime with him you useless prick. 10/10 would trade him
4426,<|emo_disgust|> You're a miserable piece of shit for saying that
4427,"<|emo_disgust|> I would hate to be that guy, but at least he will have Reddit unable to find it. "
4429,<|emo_disgust|> i think it s a bit like how the creative community has it s own weird politics and i feel youve got this weird politics that is alien to most of us
4430,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] what an ass. Good riddance to bad memories
4431,<|emo_disgust|> I'm just now realizing how true that is. I'm disgusted to learn of such things.
4432,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you burden a newborn with so much unnecessary pain. I am so sorry your baby has to go through this.
4436,"<|emo_disgust|> When it's the worst, it's the slowest. It's also the worst because your heart is still beating. "
4437,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I'm hungry now.
4438,<|emo_disgust|> He knew her like the back of his hand she was shaking. So creepy
4439,<|emo_disgust|> That looks like utter garbage.
4440,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] does deserve blame for that horrendous icing, but he and [NAME] werent the players that were guilty for it and shouldnt have used it."
4442,"<|emo_disgust|> If you're going to lie about the temperature, why would you lie about the presence of a hot dog? There's just no point in lying."
4443,<|emo_disgust|> That last sentence pains me
4446,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah it’s weird
4448,<|emo_disgust|> i feel you are very rude and condescending towards me
4449,<|emo_disgust|> This is the saddest thing I've read in a long time.
4451,"<|emo_disgust|> I see a guy who looks like he was born in 1980 and married in 1990, this is kinda sad"
4452,<|emo_disgust|> I don't particularly like the new fatalities though it's unfortunate.
4453,<|emo_disgust|> The longer they look the worse they get
4454,<|emo_disgust|> Who gives a shit. Stay in your fucking car. Stay in truck stop.
4456,<|emo_disgust|> That really sucks. So you're an uneducated twat.
4457,<|emo_disgust|> That’s an incredibly racist and sexist thing to say.
4459,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was on fire!! That's what I love about him!!! Everytime he touched the ball he made it hard to miss
4460,<|emo_disgust|> My worst fear is catching wind in my hair
4461,"<|emo_disgust|> I’m not a [NAME] guy, but I hate the New York Rangers more than the New York Yankees.... this is karma for [NAME]"
4462,<|emo_disgust|> But that suit is bad
4463,<|emo_disgust|> Oh he dead
4464,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is disgusting
4465,<|emo_disgust|> She's pretty damn ugly actually.
4467,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was just awful on Sunday
4469,"<|emo_disgust|> If I said, ""I don't know any"" those are valid reasons not to get a job."
4470,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm a horrible human being, and you're a terrible person too. I'm sorry you had to go through this. "
4471,<|emo_disgust|> Oh ok sorry
4472,<|emo_disgust|> That feels soooo greasy.
4473,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing I've seen was a 3D printed JV riding a goddam sky cannon
4474,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking heck. I'm in Ontario and hearing these comments everyday.
4475,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you! No wonder I hate you so much! /s
4476,"<|emo_disgust|> If you tell a lie, you're probably a liar. It's far more socially acceptable to talk shit about people than to tell a truth."
4477,<|emo_disgust|> I still miss him on our pp
4478,<|emo_disgust|> I think this is the worst one yet!
4479,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] looks really bad for the rest tho
4483,<|emo_disgust|> Soooooo yes. Fuck off.
4486,<|emo_disgust|> i feel just a bit cold
4488,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, [NAME], I would have said that in case it’s the same account, but yeah this is another example of them trying to be rude to me, again. "
4489,"<|emo_disgust|> And if it's not, it's because we haven't yet. It's not the fault of the workers, its the fault of society."
4490,"<|emo_disgust|> You'll have a tough time imagining anything more terrible than a fully realized vision of a god of [NAME], with giant teeth and skin like mine."
4491,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, that was ugly"
4492,<|emo_disgust|> I can’t tell if they’re being sarcastic because it’s not often that fake ones come out.
4495,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] and [NAME] are so dumb. No wonder they get together so often.
4496,<|emo_disgust|> I'm gonna say hit a birdshaped hole in my front bumper and my tires are possibly the worst in the league
4498,<|emo_disgust|> This guy is a future serial killer
4500,<|emo_disgust|> The only way I know to get rid of them is to kill them by throwing them in a big pit.
4501,<|emo_disgust|> Oh stop IT
4502,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] even bothered to come down and interview her. She’s nothing but an old, tired liar."
4503,<|emo_disgust|> What an adorable whine.
4504,<|emo_disgust|> The dude is so drunk.
4505,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] are an absolute shit.
4506,<|emo_disgust|> Lol. Can't stand those people.
4508,"<|emo_disgust|> There is a difference between ""calling your mom about a situation you didn't do"" and screaming at your mom about something you didn't do (i.e. eating a hot take)."
4509,<|emo_disgust|> It's been a weird year for me. 2016 was frustrating. Good luck next year.
4510,<|emo_disgust|> The weird thing is I think I’m the only one.
4511,<|emo_disgust|> How dare they let a man's name be associated with a sport
4512,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that was dirty.
4513,<|emo_disgust|> It’s creepy
4514,"<|emo_disgust|> Worst case scenario, is he's got insurance that covers his head, he might not be the worst dude around, but he isn't gonna put it on when he's found guilty."
4515,<|emo_disgust|> The fact he calls himself a [NAME] is terrifying
4516,"<|emo_disgust|> It was weird. I mean, yeah, there's definitely something weird about expecting someone to be more than 10% successful in life (as long as they're consistently wrong) but that was a weird expectation to have."
4517,"<|emo_disgust|> We still have emojis. Not emojis or an emoji head, but emoji heads! It's weird"
4518,<|emo_disgust|> The people running the refs at Soldier field are horrible.
4519,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is such a disgusting piece of shit that a) he would lie about anything bc he's an insecure crybaby b) he's a fucking moron c) and d) he's one of the first non- DEM candidates in many states to run on an anti-gun platform
4520,<|emo_disgust|> So if he's not 30 years old at the end of the season... he's got at least 5 more seasons!
4521,"<|emo_disgust|> Those refs seemed awful, absolutely awful.indifferent, absolutely awful."
4522,"<|emo_disgust|> Your parents are assholes, good riddance to a rotten career."
4523,<|emo_disgust|> The one with the flowers. Stupid flowers!!! 😢
4524,"<|emo_disgust|> My favorite is the girl on top saying ""you're so horny"" 3 times."
4525,"<|emo_disgust|> I think it's weird that they're allowed to show their emotions on-air in Canada, but not the US or UK."
4526,<|emo_disgust|> I’ve been playing the card game since I was 8 so I get this...I hate limit break games.
4527,<|emo_disgust|> This comment is bad because the only reason it's bad is because the author is a troll.
4529,<|emo_disgust|> Not really cringe. Just sad
4530,<|emo_disgust|> That's worse
4531,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, I read it a couple times and thought it was funny until I came across the part where she traps him"
4532,<|emo_disgust|> We are just awful at communication
4533,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a terrible host.
4534,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a horny, drunk hookup addict."
4535,<|emo_disgust|> Holy hellin heck
4537,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is here to stay we ain't getting him until we trade him and it sucks knowing that.
4538,<|emo_disgust|> I can’t wait
4539,<|emo_disgust|> You were too ugly for me to wear your heels in those pics :P.
4540,<|emo_disgust|> It really seems like all the people on here are either very stupid or at the very least extremely angry.
4541,<|emo_disgust|> They are a bunch of hoes.
4542,<|emo_disgust|> I don't think the new fatalities are that bad if these aren't people who were so horrifically sick.
4543,<|emo_disgust|> You're also disgusting for calling the police when they actually assaulted [NAME]
4544,<|emo_disgust|> And its also racist.
4545,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn it...
4546,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds yiffey but idk why the fuck people do it
4547,<|emo_disgust|> What is worrying? That [NAME] is a British national and has voted Tory for 23 years. What's he frightened of?
4548,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst I've seen
4549,<|emo_disgust|> I don't think this guy appreciates the insult.
4550,<|emo_disgust|> That’s my worst fear
4551,<|emo_disgust|> I have yet to read a positive review of anything on Reddit in over ten years
4552,<|emo_disgust|> Damn. I thought it was just my friends saying it.
4553,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, he was wrong. But I'll be wrong anyway. Sorry."
4554,<|emo_disgust|> i can feel his hurt and im crying at him
4555,"<|emo_disgust|> How dare you, she dead ahead!"
4556,<|emo_disgust|> You're a hideous human being
4557,<|emo_disgust|> She looks like a cross between [NAME] and [NAME] but with hair
4558,<|emo_disgust|> Why am I crying rn [NAME]?
4560,<|emo_disgust|> Oh I would not be surprised in the least to find him posting his old pics here and would get mad tbh!
4561,<|emo_disgust|> The people at /r/posteverything are a pack of liers.
4562,<|emo_disgust|> We've had a lot of racists elected in our country.voting someone so hateful would break new ground.
4563,<|emo_disgust|> Who gave it a failing grade? That's a grade of D-minus from the teacher.
4564,<|emo_disgust|> I thought we were the only ones with one after the long sunday war but I think we just monopoly of them
4565,"<|emo_disgust|> Holy crap, just holy crap."
4566,<|emo_disgust|> Wow I just know [NAME] is in trouble I'm over it 😣
4567,<|emo_disgust|> This actually sounds a lot more familiar to be honest. Our government actually works like this.
4568,<|emo_disgust|> Oh no! People will be able to protect themselves!
4569,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was awful and is still awful. I’m not sure how a coach could be as bad as [NAME] is right now.
4570,<|emo_disgust|> This is so creepy. Good riddance to awful rubbish. :(
4571,<|emo_disgust|> This is a perfect example of why I hate Reddit.
4572,<|emo_disgust|> You might be right but if so then I'd like to know why their companies cannot be trusted to provide replacement parts for their products
4573,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't care, and I definitely won't see [NAME] in another Nucksaucer trade in a while. Fuck my life."
4574,"<|emo_disgust|> I'd hate to see the Coyotes win in Glendale again, while [NAME] is hating it in Arizona"
4575,<|emo_disgust|> Because men are emotionally and physically unable to protect themselves in a truly crisis situation.
4576,<|emo_disgust|> When they ask for your ages lol they are creepy
4577,"<|emo_disgust|> When people think ""libertarianism is theater of choice"" they are ignorant, stupid and lack any common sense"
4578,<|emo_disgust|> You know the rest is history when no one takes you seriously
4579,<|emo_disgust|> What a cataclysm
4580,"<|emo_disgust|> In my experience as a teacher the more obnoxious kids are the ones who want to have to yell and scream in order to be heard, this is my worst fear too"
4581,<|emo_disgust|> I'm an irritable bitch but fuck this...
4582,<|emo_disgust|> I fucking hate these cakes so much.
4583,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] ISN'T LITERALLY GOD
4584,<|emo_disgust|> i wasnt feeling insulted by the woman
4585,<|emo_disgust|> That's just sad. Can I have a second away from her?
4587,<|emo_disgust|> You are unfortunately far and few between as an american.
4588,<|emo_disgust|> I didn't have a clue what he was talking about. I thought it was a video of him getting flamed so I was surprised when he was talking about how people should act now.
4589,<|emo_disgust|> i feel a little bitchy about not doing a post because i dont have anything to post
4590,<|emo_disgust|> >The thing I dread the most is running into someone you knew using this excuse.
4591,<|emo_disgust|> Why can’t I just become a worker and get outta here?
4592,<|emo_disgust|> Wow I’m hearing all these bad things about [NAME] and I think I really just like him!
4593,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, [NAME]. It's *almost as if* this is just a conscious attempt to pretend the hate is isolated to one man."
4595,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing about this video is how much of the crowd seems to be young.
4596,<|emo_disgust|> He's a weirdo.
4597,<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell thought he was dead.. [NAME] you people...
4599,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a BOR!
4600,"<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest thing about it is that it looks like a turd, not a can of beans."
4601,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I did not think I was that stupid
4602,<|emo_disgust|> Those people are so mentally ill. I can’t imagine them actually being in our community.
4603,"<|emo_disgust|> She doesn't have a birth certificate. Can't prove it, no birth certificate for her."
4604,<|emo_disgust|> The guy just put a big sign on our front door saying HELLO WORLD!
4605,<|emo_disgust|> You're a disgusting little man.
4606,<|emo_disgust|> Damn. I want to see how big that wound is
4608,<|emo_disgust|> i feel dissatisfied with myself for doing the right thing
4609,<|emo_disgust|> This sounds a little paranoid
4610,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah it's probably a mix of anxiety and feeling like a weirdo by a lot of people
4611,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds awful. I’d gladly
4612,<|emo_disgust|> i feel absolutely terrible and very upset right now and really need to go outside and get more sleep
4613,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't think so. They get called a ""bungled"" and such all the time. But a corruption investigation is far deeper (federal and state) than that and the charges are so vague."
4614,<|emo_disgust|> What a thot*!!*
4618,<|emo_disgust|> He is going to be a good president - but he is going to bring a lot of baggage and be completely disliked by many of his fellow conservatives. 
4619,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds terrible. Wasn't expecting that to actually be the case though.
4620,<|emo_disgust|> This is so disgusting. This is so slapdash. The ebrats calling themselves [RELIGION] is a big clue.
4621,<|emo_disgust|> You’re a horrible person and an awful company.
4622,<|emo_disgust|> I'm being a mean troll.
4623,<|emo_disgust|> You're gross
4625,<|emo_disgust|> He’s a scum bag.
4626,<|emo_disgust|> Weird how that works
4627,<|emo_disgust|> This is a sick post omg
4628,<|emo_disgust|> The fact it's a shirt makes it particularly awful.
4629,<|emo_disgust|> What were they hearing from these deaf people?
4631,"<|emo_disgust|> This is why the west is the greatest country in the world, they stop and think about it too...."
4633,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] you are SHIT
4634,<|emo_disgust|> > There are literally *no* women on Reddit. Aaaaaand now we're wondering why [NAME] is downvoting you.
4636,"<|emo_disgust|> I’m just going to on about my feelings, they were a bit stronger yesterday."
4637,<|emo_disgust|> I had a heck of a good life and all I remember is this
4638,<|emo_disgust|> This is what makes reddit culture so great. The stupid generalization of everything is second nature to them.
4639,<|emo_disgust|> It was the worst cinemax porn I've ever seen.
4640,"<|emo_disgust|> I know, right? I just want to hear [NAME] and [NAME] tell it."
4642,<|emo_disgust|> Holy crap that dude just had a grumpy old man yell at him and walk out. What a shit twat.
4643,<|emo_disgust|> i just feel really really selfish and angry
4644,"<|emo_disgust|> I have seen this so many times, gross I'm tired of it"
4645,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], what a fucking chaser."
4646,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you question [NAME] about your faith
4648,<|emo_disgust|> But that poor janitor.
4649,<|emo_disgust|> >it should not have even been a vote. It is a statement made by the super rich. They are disgusting
4650,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't even know a lot of people here, so I'm all like damn I hate [NAME]"
4652,<|emo_disgust|> i do feel a little bit mad
4653,"<|emo_disgust|> But I feel you. He betrayed his country, betrayed his family, betrayed his state, betrayed his God, betrayed the country, betrayed the family, and now betrayed himself."
4654,"<|emo_disgust|> There is no such thing as ugly people. If something is ""ugly"" and ""diseased"" in the eyes of many, that probably includes you."
4655,<|emo_disgust|> Your friend is a piece of shit.
4657,"<|emo_disgust|> Don't worry, she'll forgive you if you tell her what happened."
4658,<|emo_disgust|> I want them to go all the way and make him the head coach of the Chargers and be super upset with him when he comes back.
4659,<|emo_disgust|> I'm offended that he called people who disagree with him bigots and racists.
4660,<|emo_disgust|> So now you're saying non-discrimination means white people are inferior. What sort of superior beings are you talking about?
4662,"<|emo_disgust|> It’s more of a climate issue. If you live in the coldest part of the country, odds are you will heat up in the summer months."
4664,<|emo_disgust|> It’s sad that we couldn’t get into [NAME] trade talks this off season. What a nightmare.
4666,<|emo_disgust|> That's so awful. Is Reddit ever gonna get its act together?
4667,<|emo_disgust|> This is a weird one
4668,<|emo_disgust|> That shit really drives me crazy tbh with the picture and text.
4669,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is one of the worst goalies I've ever seen.
4670,<|emo_disgust|> Well that's disgusting. Totes.
4671,<|emo_disgust|> This is not a test and you are asking stupid questions.
4672,<|emo_disgust|> I’m a guy. I’m 30. I still can’t get laid.
4674,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm really not that worried about losing him then, since he hasnt been active on the field for at least 2 months now. "
4676,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, she looks like a freak. "
4677,<|emo_disgust|> We still have shitty laws.
4678,<|emo_disgust|> This fucking ad
4680,<|emo_disgust|> When a young child takes the dare to have sex...
4681,<|emo_disgust|> It’s weird to be like “what the fuck” when someone doesn’t Like you.
4682,<|emo_disgust|> He was in a relationship where he had serious trust issues. This is a new development for him.
4683,<|emo_disgust|> They are so afraid to admit there is a problem.
4684,<|emo_disgust|> That is quite disgusting actually. And while I understand the concern over online sellers I think that is a valid issue.
4685,<|emo_disgust|> What a nasty goal! Gives you chills!
4686,"<|emo_disgust|> That'd be an awful argument. She's still a hypocrite, but the hypocrite is making things worse rather than helping."
4687,<|emo_disgust|> But I don't eat meat. Those are my options!
4688,<|emo_disgust|> What a fuckenlistment bro
4690,"<|emo_disgust|> I hate both [NAME] and [NAME] as much as the next fan, but seriously, have one of them ever actually played for any other organization?"
4691,<|emo_disgust|> What a lame and useless tool.
4692,<|emo_disgust|> I'm more than sure they wouldnt feel the need to buy them drugs. I've asked that I don't comment.
4693,<|emo_disgust|> Omg [NAME] if she ever gets in touch with you ever youll be gone
4694,<|emo_disgust|> I mean no one would argue against a player wearing No logo jersey either
4695,"<|emo_disgust|> That's sick, your a freak."
4696,<|emo_disgust|> I feel bad for the car. I'm lucky.
4698,"<|emo_disgust|> What a disgusting mix of Shut your mouth and piss out, you cowards."
4699,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] just insulted [NAME]. Is the media fault for calling him a moron? It seems ignorant.
4700,<|emo_disgust|> In Canada it is rare but not guaranteed that you get turned away. Ask the bus driver if you need help. In the USA ask the security guard for his card.
4701,<|emo_disgust|> He should be ashamed of himself. This is petty bs.
4703,"<|emo_disgust|> Your age difference is incredibly creepy, and particularly creepy when you consider what a relationship Looks like between a 20 year old and an expectant father."
4705,<|emo_disgust|> He’s a jerk.
4706,"<|emo_disgust|> No, he was assaulted. Not once. Not by a dog, no, by aELF."
4709,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] that was so terrible. he must have fainted the entire scene.
4710,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, my bad lol"
4711,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm too tired to watch the Super Bowl. What a miserable, disgusting and embarrassing waste of air time."
4713,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, sorry. I thought this was a post about the Braid hair."
4716,<|emo_disgust|> i went to the meeting i said sorry but i cant help but feel angry
4717,<|emo_disgust|> This is the exact kind of stuff I said before it was so disgusting I felt bad posting it here but I'm so sorry
4718,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] the most unappreciated and underappreciated basketball player in Orlando magic history.
4719,"<|emo_disgust|> Not true at all. And in reality, its much worse."
4720,<|emo_disgust|> My advice to you is to find a therapist who fits your needs. Don't worry if your therapist doesn't give you a straight answer. Ask.
4721,<|emo_disgust|> But the problem is his wife. The fact he's single is so incredibly disgusting.
4722,<|emo_disgust|> Oh wow. Thanks! I have no idea about the other ones. I am really sorry :)
4723,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird how people assume things without basis.
4724,<|emo_disgust|> This is not a vote you get in a democracy. This is a goddamn show.
4725,<|emo_disgust|> This is creepy and weird and sad. Eleven??? A baby! I was also in college. I can’t imagine.
4726,<|emo_disgust|> Soooo bad its funny.
4727,"<|emo_disgust|> Your friend got her ass handed to her by a drunk driver and is now trying to justify it by saying ""I didnt know what I was doing""...oh dear"
4728,"<|emo_disgust|> i hate fags in general but i feel if im against them, it s because i hate what they offer"
4729,<|emo_disgust|> i feel slightly offended by this
4730,<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry to hear about that! Wounded and shaken but alive and well :)
4732,<|emo_disgust|> Who said I hated him? He's a good guy. I just hated his new video.
4733,<|emo_disgust|> How dare they! Now is garbage!
4734,<|emo_disgust|> Because there is no way to know for sure
4735,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I was wondering how it felt to get downvoted to hell for saying that about [NAME]!
4736,"<|emo_disgust|> He is a disgusting democrat, what a disgusting democrat."
4737,"<|emo_disgust|> If everyone was like ""oh it was the cat, it was probably the dog, time to get out of here"" you wouldnt have heard a peep. "
4738,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing that changed was the hair. It looked so natural in the beginning. Then I noticed the eyebrows and it just kinda vanished
4739,<|emo_disgust|> I actually really hope we get another agent from there because frankly I think [NAME] are pretty terrible at signing
4741,"<|emo_disgust|> Well it's not ""its not *its* your fault"". Well it is just your failure and lack of care which is the problem."
4742,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst thing I've seen on this subreddit.
4743,<|emo_disgust|> My [NAME]...I feel you...
4744,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] and [NAME] were worst in the country by far behind [NAME] and [NAME].
4745,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, the thing about it is that you need to leave for work at least an hour early for it to count... but this is more of a nightmare than a practical joke. "
4746,<|emo_disgust|> So now I’m wondering what the point is of that?
4747,<|emo_disgust|> Just a dumb phone call.
4748,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, look another shit call"
4749,<|emo_disgust|> And there we have it. It's creepy that there are apparently more pedophiles in New York than in Chicago.
4752,<|emo_disgust|> Your mom told you your dad is weird?
4753,<|emo_disgust|> Oh my [NAME] my [NAME]
4754,<|emo_disgust|> Why would I want to grow up like that? My parents helped me get my GED so that 
4755,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting!
4756,"<|emo_disgust|> This guy has too many knives, I don't trust him very much."
4757,<|emo_disgust|> It's actually worse honestly
4758,"<|emo_disgust|> In the world of Massively Multiplayer online roleplaying games, the term ""playing with the girl next door"" is reserved for an actualised relationship. Your statement is therefore absolutely correct."
4759,<|emo_disgust|> Aaand he lost a heart-shaped apple.
4760,<|emo_disgust|> This woman has an 8 year old son she's literally just eating shit
4761,<|emo_disgust|> Wow the level of denial the top boys reached on this is absolutely stunning.
4764,<|emo_disgust|> Well that sucks. I was not going to be the one to say that.
4765,<|emo_disgust|> It’s just a tad too much bong bongs to be disgusting.
4766,<|emo_disgust|> i feel quite disgusted
4767,"<|emo_disgust|> What, just the title? Stop trying to be so hype about it. I can't believe we elected you. #GOTYOWN"
4768,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit that's messed up.
4769,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah he was mad that he couldn’t win his starting job and he didn’t get much offseason help.
4770,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fucking STAR. I don't think I've ever seen him as bad as this.
4772,<|emo_disgust|> That was truly disgusting... He should be embarrassed or at the very least should be deposed...
4773,<|emo_disgust|> Holy fuck this is straight up gross
4775,<|emo_disgust|> You dirty traitor
4776,<|emo_disgust|> Your story sounds a little paranoid. I never said I hated him. I said I hated him for similar reasons.
4777,<|emo_disgust|> I really hate this.
4778,<|emo_disgust|> But the important thing here is that they are not paying anything to you other than your upfront costs. I'm mad at them for that.
4780,<|emo_disgust|> This is how it's been done for so long now it's disgusting.
4781,<|emo_disgust|> This comment is stupid.
4782,<|emo_disgust|> Oh god theres more distressed distressed distressed grandparents. I cant believe our tax dollars are paying for these turds.
4783,"<|emo_disgust|> That is so disgusting, and the girl said nothing. Tkachuk is good at lying"
4784,<|emo_disgust|> But it’s literally a picture of [NAME]! Wtf?!
4785,<|emo_disgust|> i have been feeling really irritable lately
4786,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit. Just. Holy. Fuck.
4787,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking bummer. It’s just not us. I hate it so much.
4789,<|emo_disgust|> I'm ashamed that you wrote that. Your article makes me sick. Go live in a bubble then.
4792,<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest thing is the fan who thinks this is true.
4793,<|emo_disgust|> I never thought I'd see a comrade here.
4794,<|emo_disgust|> This is just fucking stupid.
4796,<|emo_disgust|> There is more than one way to call a shit call
4797,<|emo_disgust|> I guess that was my fault for being a weirdo?
4798,<|emo_disgust|> Omg why does her head hurt?
4799,<|emo_disgust|> I don’t have a plan! I’m just going to be a fucking monster 😤
4800,<|emo_disgust|> He has a weird way of putting his fingers in his mouth when he punctures his ego
4801,<|emo_disgust|> This is fucking sick
4803,"<|emo_disgust|> My wife is about as straight as a (soon to be ex-)wife. of her is looking at you [NAME], she’s a bit weird"
4804,<|emo_disgust|> I know right! I feel my stomach twist in disgust.
4805,<|emo_disgust|> We can’t change what people do but we can change how they think
4807,"<|emo_disgust|> No, the article was about that dude being a hoe, and that's why he got a bad vibe from bros."
4808,<|emo_disgust|> What a moron
4809,<|emo_disgust|> We haven’t beaten up anyone in particular
4811,<|emo_disgust|> This woman's a horrible person and an awful mother. One does not have to agree with her to be appalled by her.
4812,<|emo_disgust|> > No wonder we don't know anything about it apart from the general environment.
4813,<|emo_disgust|> Man I hate my city.
4816,"<|emo_disgust|> Fuck, you probably cant, as you obviously do not have your twitter account. :( "
4817,<|emo_disgust|> i was feeling pretty cold today morning
4818,<|emo_disgust|> He’s a disgusting moron.
4819,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has some seriously weird ideas about everything. I love it
4820,<|emo_disgust|> I do see how it goes but that's not the point. I know it's a meme but it's not funny in any way.
4821,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] what the HELL are you talking about
4822,<|emo_disgust|> Just remember we’re all just human on this earth. That’s all there is to it. Stay strong.
4823,<|emo_disgust|> Those are hideous.
4825,"<|emo_disgust|> I hate it when families with autistic children do this... their autistic children usually assume that the adults are neglectful,uttonous, and often dress like prostitutes"
4826,<|emo_disgust|> This is the saddest thing I've seen today
4827,"<|emo_disgust|> The fuck? No deal, abort, abort"
4828,<|emo_disgust|> It's not his fault; his wife is his worst enemy.
4830,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is the one who should be banned from the floor.
4833,<|emo_disgust|> That guy is a moron.
4834,<|emo_disgust|> The lack of a carpool lane makes me feel more distracted than [NAME] at age 35
4835,"<|emo_disgust|> ""How dare you lack respect for the movie industry's throne"" <3"
4836,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Bathsheep oil"" is pretty shitty."
4838,<|emo_disgust|> I'm so fucking hot
4839,<|emo_disgust|> I can barely remember how many degrasse you guys have fucked and I remember all because of that game.
4840,"<|emo_disgust|> No one to blame here, fault should go to the individuals, but his post was absolutely disgusting and should be ignored."
4841,<|emo_disgust|> Shut up nagy body
4842,<|emo_disgust|> The worst game of all time is still the best game of all time. It's just a game...
4843,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fucking scumbag. Yes, I hate him too."
4844,<|emo_disgust|> That’s absolutely disgusting. Apt.
4845,"<|emo_disgust|> The thing is, [NAME] is just awful. So awful that it's funny."
4846,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh wow, I didn't even know that you were that close with your ex. It looks like everything came out alright for you. Thanks for the update, mate!"
4847,<|emo_disgust|> He's a sexual monster!!!!
4848,<|emo_disgust|> It's more of a fear of running out. Especially if you're high.
4849,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking idiot lololol
4850,<|emo_disgust|> I can't believe he took that shot.
4851,"<|emo_disgust|> How dare you, [NAME]!"
4852,<|emo_disgust|> Because [NAME] doesn't wanna show his hand to the world.
4853,<|emo_disgust|> The only way to truly understand this is to read their entire complaint. It's disgusting.
4854,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking asshole. I hate him so much.
4855,"<|emo_disgust|> In my experience, the more people that get mad at me, the more it makes me feel better. "
4856,<|emo_disgust|> I feel his hate and it makes me sad.
4857,"<|emo_disgust|> I’m going to have to agree, the way we are playing right now could very well shift over to a 3-4 as we get more familiar with each other."
4858,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, there have been some very bad actors in movies, certainly bad enough to merit the wrath of GOD, but also bad enough to deserve praise or glory."
4859,<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting. No politician should comment on something so disgusting.
4860,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] you're disgusting
4861,<|emo_disgust|> i know i should be skeptical and even more reluctant but i was curious and frustrated to see if i felt more agitated and frustrated
4863,<|emo_disgust|> That guy was beyond cringe. It was creepy.
4864,<|emo_disgust|> Not a chance. She hates us because [NAME] never cared about them. [NAME]? Fuck him off to where he can run his mouth.
4865,"<|emo_disgust|> That's a lot of karma, ouch!"
4866,<|emo_disgust|> No. Not racist. Just a dumb question.
4867,<|emo_disgust|> I've had sleep paralysis once. For the last week and a half. A very bad one. It's worse than death.
4868,"<|emo_disgust|> I am a person of color and hearing someone of color say that ""we mustn't"" makes me want to circle the drain."
4870,"<|emo_disgust|> The way I said it, I'm not terribly fond of the way [NAME] handled Luka. "
4873,"<|emo_disgust|> This has to be the worst tip of the day. I don't have any animals, but I've heard tipsters swear by toothpaste."
4874,<|emo_disgust|> I mean no deal right now. This has been an absolute nightmare from the start. We literally have no idea what's happening
4875,<|emo_disgust|> That dude was as mad as all hell when we put [NAME] on the books.
4876,<|emo_disgust|> The one thing you can be sure of is the one of them is terrified of cold.
4877,<|emo_disgust|> We did this...
4878,"<|emo_disgust|> And since your mother told you that you couldn't have an opinion, guess what? You're allowed to have one... because you have opinions."
4879,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah the fact that even a month old has to ask her mom what her butt looks like before she can get a handle on it makes me think she's got a disorder
4880,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I want it to be like that.
4881,<|emo_disgust|> That dude had a face full of maggots
4882,<|emo_disgust|> You should come. I'd love to interview the guy.
4884,<|emo_disgust|> You know the original comment was a bit weird. I guess it was just a matter of how awful it was in grammar.
4885,<|emo_disgust|> This is so creepy.
4886,<|emo_disgust|> That's not true at all. The New York Times article is pretty cringy.
4888,<|emo_disgust|> This is amazing! I love the claps after he fell though.
4889,<|emo_disgust|> She's a disgusting snob.. take a look at her car.. id be pissed if it's hers
4890,"<|emo_disgust|> It's actually shockingly easy to get sucked into the cults and horrors of Nazism, religion, and the like."
4891,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] fucking stop
4892,<|emo_disgust|> This is horrible. You can do this to your family and friends? I’d rather be messed up like this than a nice dinner out with friends.
4894,<|emo_disgust|> She's been in our area for 20 years and hasn't had a scratch.
4895,<|emo_disgust|> So it goes with many other movies I've seen. The pressure to keep the plot thick or keep interest.
4896,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is the dirtiest psychopath
4897,"<|emo_disgust|> The real worst thing about this video is how much of it has shakycam, I tried to turn it off but it made me cringe really hard. "
4898,"<|emo_disgust|> It's a fucking men's rights issue, they want to lock women up just because they have the temerity to complain."
4899,"<|emo_disgust|> I can see where the offense being an awful strength, but I hate the scheme and I really want to see [NAME] play. "
4900,<|emo_disgust|> How dare they not find domestic abuse funny! /s
4902,<|emo_disgust|> There’s also the ridiculous amount of people that will never even be friends with women.
4903,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] that is not cute man
4905,<|emo_disgust|> Oh lord this is so infuriating.
4907,<|emo_disgust|> They want me to hate them and live in a world of hate.
4910,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like ive been abused like a bird
4911,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has been very effective in getting the calls and it has helped improve the situation
4912,<|emo_disgust|> What a bizarre post omg
4913,<|emo_disgust|> I’d take the floor’s edge for a minute if she was still alive
4914,<|emo_disgust|> It wasn't the guy who tried to kill us with a lightning rod. It was our entire faith and sacrifice.
4915,<|emo_disgust|> Now THAT is a murder by words!
4916,<|emo_disgust|> And what has she done? She's nothing but congratulations!
4917,<|emo_disgust|> The internet never ceases to surprise
4918,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], if I were a celebrity, I would probably have said the same... I've been in this game for 10 years "
4919,<|emo_disgust|> i can get away with this but i feel kinda dissatisfied just thinking about it
4922,<|emo_disgust|> Your brother is a moron.
4923,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is one nasty woman.
4924,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Fucking hate [NAME]"" is pretty much their policy."
4925,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was getting some bad passes and [NAME] was open...
4926,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you suggest that maybe people with these mental health issues don’t have it rough...you’re a mental monster!
4928,<|emo_disgust|> He is weird
4929,<|emo_disgust|> My wife has had several jobs that involved her cleaning house and working late at night. She’s a stay at home mom.
4931,<|emo_disgust|> The real reason to be angry is that we are having an awful year on and off the court.
4933,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking dipshit
4934,"<|emo_disgust|> Just saying, “I’m here and I want “my cake back” sounds fucking creepy. "
4935,"<|emo_disgust|> I've also had my fair share of online harassment. Not online, but in real life. That has to be a hell of a burden to carry."
4936,<|emo_disgust|> They’re loud. I’m just not comfortable being around them. :(
4937,<|emo_disgust|> It’s like you’RE saying it should be illegal to talk to pets.....
4938,<|emo_disgust|> Wow so you really are just a racist? Well good luck finding someone else who is.
4939,<|emo_disgust|> I think it's pretty safe to assume she's not a bi/pansexual.
4940,<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck? I just watched the news. There was more brutality on the streets than in that movie.
4941,<|emo_disgust|> I have no other place to go...
4942,<|emo_disgust|> Weird looking cat.
4945,"<|emo_disgust|> And no, by that logic, they're totally not terrible fans."
4946,<|emo_disgust|> This is exactly what I said. My only sympathy is that I feel personally attacked.
4947,<|emo_disgust|> Sooooo disgusting
4948,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst I've seen...
4949,<|emo_disgust|> Now that that’s disgusting
4951,<|emo_disgust|> He can only be compared to [NAME]. The trash will always support the paper
4952,<|emo_disgust|> The worst of the Worst.
4953,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] just went 6-11 in his final two seasons. I think he missed that by a factor of 10 or more. I think he's still one of the best pass catchers in the league, but he's just not elite."
4954,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] on a hot dog. I think its just about human nature just trying to survive. You always think about people and how horrible you would make them feel and its just a learned helplessness. I'm not sure why I'm so mad about it.
4955,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah but what if all the cars we make that are going to be around in 10 years were made by Toyota? I'm kinda heartless.
4956,<|emo_disgust|> The secondhand panic and embarrassment I feel from this is astounding
4957,<|emo_disgust|> He actually looks really pissed off.
4958,"<|emo_disgust|> And by the way, the other [NAME] is a freak!"
4959,"<|emo_disgust|> You're the worst kind of person, but what you're doing is what has made you a monster."
4960,"<|emo_disgust|> ""It's just a game"" is a dumb argument."
4961,<|emo_disgust|> This is just extremely creepy.
4962,<|emo_disgust|> The other day while I was out hiking it started to snow. It was so miserable. I thought it had picked up somewhere around -6-ish.
4963,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like my mind is blank i really can t imagine it
4966,<|emo_disgust|> He's so angry.
4969,<|emo_disgust|> So this is the new movie *Fucken Bird*
4970,<|emo_disgust|> This guy needs help
4971,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah no money, nothing and nobody. I'm homeless now, because I could never keep up with the cost of living. "
4972,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I'm sorry for your loss. Keep in touch with them.
4973,<|emo_disgust|> You're going to get very angry and swear a lot.
4974,<|emo_disgust|> And yet there YOU are mad...
4975,<|emo_disgust|> It was bad enough for [NAME] that there were four players sent home with injuries but he had those same guys come back and started 15 straight.
4976,<|emo_disgust|> That’s an awful lot of pills for a bong.
4977,<|emo_disgust|> I really don't like this.
4978,<|emo_disgust|> Thats disgusting. Its disgusting that even the top level staff at large Japanese companies still stubbornly refuse to recognize Same-sex couples.
4979,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has been an absolute horror for us. I fear for the players lives if we allow him to stay
4980,<|emo_disgust|> Well this is frustrating.
4981,<|emo_disgust|> They're so fucking ugly
4982,<|emo_disgust|> Those are some seriously gross looking teeth
4983,<|emo_disgust|> That's bad... :(
4984,"<|emo_disgust|> My bad. Wasn't even sure if that comment was legalese, sorry dude"
4985,<|emo_disgust|> He really is!
4986,"<|emo_disgust|> They're still allowed to eat dogs, it's just that they can't eat beef anymore. Weird, no?"
4987,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck this meme
4988,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is when there's nothing there that's horrible at all!
4989,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] what an asshole
4990,"<|emo_disgust|> The problem is almost as bad if not worse with a gun. I mean, at least with a gun you're less likely to accidentally kill someone you have wronged."
4991,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, I'm also nervous about all the free food."
4992,<|emo_disgust|> There should be a limit of 6 characters per sub name. Is ridiculous.
4993,<|emo_disgust|> It’s the worst when it’s something that does absolutely nothing. Like this.
4994,<|emo_disgust|> This game is getting ridiculous
4996,<|emo_disgust|> He has a troubled past
4998,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, weirded out at most of the stuff. "
4999,<|emo_disgust|> This has to be the most miserable response I've seen on /r/television. I feel for you.
5000,<|emo_disgust|> He isn't. He's a very interesting man.
5002,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling very resentful for it
5003,<|emo_disgust|> i feel kinda pissed right now
5004,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Fuck off"" you Cant talk to her"
5005,<|emo_disgust|> You should see the woman herself. Screaming and yelling at your kid could very well be the last thing this woman needs right now.
5006,<|emo_disgust|> I'm surprised they could find toothpaste and toothpaste washer fluid that big.....
5007,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck it I'll add a third eye and eyeshadow for you too. 🤮🤣
5008,<|emo_disgust|> What a douche! I hope the writer of this post is as douchy as him.
5010,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking cuck
5011,<|emo_disgust|> The best thing to do after a bad dating situation is to find some who are just like you.
5013,<|emo_disgust|> You're saying she would go on to become the President of the United States.
5014,<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck did I just read?
5015,"<|emo_disgust|> I want to say I'm shocked, but I honestly am."
5016,<|emo_disgust|> My wife hates me because I went into the bedroom and she locked the door. lock it she said its her fucking turn to be naughty lol
5018,<|emo_disgust|> You can’t post that to /r/childfree and expect to get a positive response for it lol
5019,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, fuck your husband."
5020,<|emo_disgust|> You're just heartless if you call others dumb for caring for you when you care for them.
5021,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a horrible and racist person. Stop supporting her
5022,<|emo_disgust|> She would of kissed him. Didn't have to be awkward for that.
5023,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling pretty mad and upset at myself lately
5024,"<|emo_disgust|> No problem, sorry."
5025,<|emo_disgust|> i feel i don t have any friends
5026,<|emo_disgust|> If you're unhappy with your life you'll always be happy with your penis.
5027,"<|emo_disgust|> No, what I meant is that we are not seeing a different side of her"
5028,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that’s s enough already
5030,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh look, it's a sitting duck."
5031,<|emo_disgust|> There's a lot of us ladies! We make up queens all the time!
5032,<|emo_disgust|> This has got to be one the dumbest draft picks I’ve ever seen.
5034,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck em.
5035,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, I felt like this once. Was a horrible experience. Never again"
5036,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah it's the worst, no matter what game you are playing."
5037,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow what an obnoxious, drunk girl. "
5038,<|emo_disgust|> It is an incredibly disheartening feeling to see
5039,<|emo_disgust|> Oh my [NAME] get the fuck out
5041,<|emo_disgust|> Shut up u/sadgasm
5042,"<|emo_disgust|> It was like a scene fromucked up in there. I couldn't put my finger on how bad it was, but it's still one of my All Time Worst movies"
5044,"<|emo_disgust|> I’m not being racist, I just found your entire comments on Reddit to be disgusting."
5045,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, that's disgusting"
5046,<|emo_disgust|> She was actually abused in the court papers.... So what?
5047,"<|emo_disgust|> So, if I have depression, imagine if it wasn't for Reddit. Then imagine just letting it go"
5048,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh yeah? Btw, I've had a few conversations with [NAME] on this too"
5049,<|emo_disgust|> Lol I’m in so much pain now! I hated saying it but I can’t even get out a pack of cigarettes.
5050,<|emo_disgust|> And the reason is they didn’t want to pay for his house. Which is a pretty shitty thing to do
5051,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't mind either, but I don't understand how a fully automatic assault rifle could ever be a problem."
5053,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] just needs a little more love, it’s heartbreaking as all hell"
5054,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] really needs to be brought up more often, it's been wayyyyy worse than the [NAME] situations in Sydney. "
5056,<|emo_disgust|> i hope you are feeling quite angry but i dont think you are yet ready to say that
5057,<|emo_disgust|> That motherfucker!
5058,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit that was fucking bad...'ll never do that to my kids
5059,<|emo_disgust|> i dont feel the need to bully anyone or make them feel as though theyre stupid
5061,<|emo_disgust|> This is so disgusting. Wtf is wrong with us? Why are we trying to be so terrible?
5062,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] this is terrible
5063,<|emo_disgust|> The poor guy.
5064,<|emo_disgust|> Omg this is so dumb. She's a pro-Assad piece of shit and not much else.
5066,<|emo_disgust|> How dare u care about your physical and mental health you shitlord you!!!!!! /s
5067,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Fuck not gonna happen"" is the line most frequently heard on this sub. ""I don't care"" is the line least often heard"
5068,<|emo_disgust|> That's so rude. I hope your new manager treats you better.
5069,<|emo_disgust|> They actually get mad at people who don't play their games... just like us.
5070,<|emo_disgust|> The “sad face” text is particularly cringe-worthy.
5072,<|emo_disgust|> What a bummer but also a great example of how great we are at Whataburger USA
5073,<|emo_disgust|> Well in that case I’d be very surprised if she liked you.
5074,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, she dead"
5075,<|emo_disgust|> The best thing from them is that they are still single mothers.
5076,"<|emo_disgust|> The only real condolences I've seen were from people saying ""hope you don't get pregnant"" and some really mean and disgusting things."
5078,<|emo_disgust|> That’s horrifying
5079,<|emo_disgust|> You can't pick and choose racism you dippy cunt
5080,<|emo_disgust|> That woman is a monster.
5084,"<|emo_disgust|> The new ""bad breath"" is worse. The old one just seemed worse than nothing."
5085,"<|emo_disgust|> My parents divorced when I was born, and it was very hard for me to process that."
5086,<|emo_disgust|> Wow!!! You must have bad internet
5088,<|emo_disgust|> This is so creepy. Good riddance.
5089,<|emo_disgust|> I wonder what would happen if we used a different color for the lock symbol
5090,"<|emo_disgust|> But if she knew the stuff was even more dangerous, she would be aghast. A Better Life for [NAME] indeed"
5091,<|emo_disgust|> You’re a terrible person. You really do know nothing about anything. Look at your facts. And have no pity for anyone who doesn’t have the same luck.
5092,"<|emo_disgust|> We don't need to be scared of them, we need to be proud."
5093,"<|emo_disgust|> If she does it again, I’m slapping her hard."
5094,<|emo_disgust|> This guy is a douchebag.
5095,<|emo_disgust|> Because he is a disgusting moron.
5097,<|emo_disgust|> I was the opposite. It's been a weird year for me
5098,<|emo_disgust|> So you again - the stupidest thing my dad has said so far.
5099,"<|emo_disgust|> You have been using the word ""fuck"" so many times I'm amazed people don't know the difference."
5101,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] and the [NAME] of them would find this so damn disgusting it would make me sick to my stomach.
5102,<|emo_disgust|> i almost feel outraged that a few people in the crowd feel entitled to public holidays
5103,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is worse... [NAME] is literally worse
5104,<|emo_disgust|> That is so disgusting. VWP
5105,<|emo_disgust|> No. Your reading is bad and your writing style is terrible. Begone from reddit.
5106,<|emo_disgust|> Now I'm wondering if he'll even want us to play him at our normal power forward position...
5107,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn.. I was really hoping for the best when it came to the song choice in this game for the most part, but it went absolutely against every other game mode I've played in"
5108,<|emo_disgust|> Weird how they all look the same to me
5109,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] this is painful
5110,<|emo_disgust|> He’s going to hate us no matter what.
5111,<|emo_disgust|> They still have fucking cars!
5112,<|emo_disgust|> It is what it is. The hate is getting all the way down to the wire.
5114,"<|emo_disgust|> Shut it, [NAME]. "
5115,<|emo_disgust|> Just get it over with. No one wants to hear about your dirty little secret.
5116,<|emo_disgust|> We're all crazy
5117,"<|emo_disgust|> This guy isn’t far off from the xenophobic, anti-Semitic, racist, and sexist xenophobes who are the most hateful on the planet. These movements feed off each other."
5119,<|emo_disgust|> So are you. It's far fetched though.
5120,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that his shirt says “hasn” on it is pretty telling in itself.
5121,<|emo_disgust|> You have no idea what's happened in the past decade-twent century of sexual slavery. It's horrific.
5122,"<|emo_disgust|> So long as they don't act any remotely bad, it's fine."
5123,<|emo_disgust|> Lol that's pretty disgusting.
5124,<|emo_disgust|> He's so much worse than [NAME]
5125,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was not in the wrong. This is why I hate Twitter
5126,<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest thing is getting high before you hookup
5127,"<|emo_disgust|> What an awful list. Where “[NAME] is missing are [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME] all in the same starting line up"
5128,<|emo_disgust|> I fucking love this sub
5129,<|emo_disgust|> So many people are saying that [NAME] is a bad hire because we didn’t pay him market value.
5131,"<|emo_disgust|> And the ""us"" here is the City who would be hurting by the hike."
5134,<|emo_disgust|> That's some pretty dangerous shit around here.
5135,"<|emo_disgust|> No, she was too afraid to call the police. "
5136,"<|emo_disgust|> This is like the story of how I met my wife, [NAME]"
5137,<|emo_disgust|> I can't even remember the last time I've felt like that
5140,"<|emo_disgust|> > If she's under 30 and you are, that's weird af."
5141,<|emo_disgust|> Don't make your room the asshole's.
5142,"<|emo_disgust|> The most offensive thing he said about [NAME] is ""I really don't like him."" Like who?"
5143,"<|emo_disgust|> The most awful thing you can Imagine, the kind that will leave you permanently disfigured, is to be forced to watch it"
5144,<|emo_disgust|> I'll kill you.
5145,<|emo_disgust|> I'm thinking it's the middle finger gun.
5146,<|emo_disgust|> He sounds terrible :(
5148,"<|emo_disgust|> She's actually a weirdo, in that she hates herself as a person and wants you to have low expectations for her."
5149,"<|emo_disgust|> She’s a pro-Assad piece of shit, there are way better words for this."
5150,<|emo_disgust|> But those guys sure speak for themselves.
5151,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I hate how much I love it. The art style is damn gorgeous though.
5152,<|emo_disgust|> That's his real name...Buckwheat. His real name is [NAME] and he's a disgusting scumbag.
5153,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like it s a pretty dangerous game to play
5154,<|emo_disgust|> She was an awful campaign manager.
5155,<|emo_disgust|> It's always creepy.
5156,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Dude, you're in for a rude awakening soon, alright?"" "
5157,<|emo_disgust|> Oh I hate that too
5159,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] on the phone with a buddy asking what it’s like to have a girlfriend
5160,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck that. Stay in your car.
5162,<|emo_disgust|> Weirdo! Who wants a piece of that pizza??
5163,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fuckin monster.
5166,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Stop saying mean things about me. You're a mean girl."""
5168,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you use yourion as an excuse to get fucking drunk.
5169,<|emo_disgust|> The third period is hurting me.
5170,<|emo_disgust|> It's just a mask.
5172,<|emo_disgust|> I just don't feel like reading about [RELIGION] in the News.
5173,<|emo_disgust|> This story is the dumbest possible beginning for a Netflix documentary. From the story he tells here it looks more like an information dump than a skeptical exploration of cryptozoology.
5174,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, I could of course, they made a video saying they are sorry, for any wrong doing. "
5175,<|emo_disgust|> The whole city of Toronto is going to be pissed about this.
5176,"<|emo_disgust|> Worst case scenario is she doesn't know what she's talking about and isn't being factually incorrect when she says ""boys""."
5177,<|emo_disgust|> This sounds so terrible. I’ve never done anything like this. Can you link a video or something?
5179,<|emo_disgust|> No. Not a good one.
5181,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME]....
5182,<|emo_disgust|> If you don't mind the smell I highly suggest going to a neighborhood bodega and buying some used clothes.
5183,"<|emo_disgust|> No, he's a good doctor and a very accomplished person. You can't make a bad doctor or a good doctor out of someone. Thank you for your refutation. "
5186,"<|emo_disgust|> You are the worst kind of person, and you should be ashamed for what you've done."
5187,<|emo_disgust|> Who is against [NAME] now? You are not for the second amendment. That's your bigoted talking point.
5188,<|emo_disgust|> What has the op learned since he took office?
5189,<|emo_disgust|> In this day and age I honestly don't see a single one of these fake orginies being done in any other country. It's definitely the case here.
5190,<|emo_disgust|> I do not enjoy cold showers.
5191,<|emo_disgust|> Your a moron for making that connection in the first place
5192,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a horrible piece of shit
5194,<|emo_disgust|> They really don't like the way its written or where the spelling is going with his name.
5195,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is working with dealerships. They will often misrepresent the emissions characteristics of new vehicles in order to secure a sale
5196,<|emo_disgust|> It's not because I'm right... it's because you're incredibly dumb.
5197,<|emo_disgust|> That'll teach her lesson.
5198,"<|emo_disgust|> If you are on this sub, you are fucking disgusting."
5199,<|emo_disgust|> Damn even [NAME] has acceptedance in this day and age.
5200,<|emo_disgust|> You're an awful person and have a habit of doing terrible things yourself
5201,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah dude, it is a weird way to say ""no."" They just hate ""no."" "
5202,"<|emo_disgust|> You're right! That movie really damaged my teeth, but I kept watching!"
5203,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a greedy bastard
5205,"<|emo_disgust|> >You are not actually a better person. You're an angry, mentally ill cat who doesn't know how to take a compliment."
5207,<|emo_disgust|> It's the worst when it's something you believe in
5208,"<|emo_disgust|> This is awful, and how DARE you state your opinion??? Not funny just awful"
5209,"<|emo_disgust|> They really do be so. If [NAME] were a human they'd be a big, angry hug."
5210,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is the most useless underrated player.
5212,<|emo_disgust|> i feel extremely petty and self indulgent in my life right now
5213,<|emo_disgust|> What's the source? I love the video. It just makes me so angry.
5214,"<|emo_disgust|> If I was to die, I would want to have a great cake!"
5215,<|emo_disgust|> This is a really hard post to follow. I’ve never felt so insulted by a friend in my life
5217,<|emo_disgust|> No it doesn't. You're a horrible person.
5218,<|emo_disgust|> I was thinking about that last night as well. It would seem far more dangerous to run into an impossibly high wall of steel and not break anything
5219,<|emo_disgust|> I hate when I’m wrong.
5222,<|emo_disgust|> This might just be my worst fear
5223,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] what a disgusting woman.
5224,"<|emo_disgust|> This is why she killed herself, to show the world that if you're a sadist, you deserve to die"
5225,<|emo_disgust|> I think all of you are morons.
5226,<|emo_disgust|> It was fucking shocking not to be honest. I've felt worse by compared to last night.
5228,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit that guy didn't get the puck?
5229,"<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting, the way he wrote [NAME] is so bad."
5230,"<|emo_disgust|> This made me feel bad for the Broncos, I loved the Jags :("
5231,<|emo_disgust|> You're a hideous and disgusting person.
5232,"<|emo_disgust|> This is so creepy and feels like it was written by a child. (And, in all honesty, a adult)"
5233,"<|emo_disgust|> You see, we're all aots, some more obnoxious than others."
5235,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I miss this 😭😭😭 I'm sorry that you had to go through all that
5236,<|emo_disgust|> This is the single worst thing that can possibly possibly be said about ME3
5237,<|emo_disgust|> Your wife is a bloody monster!
5238,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, if I say I love you, what do you do? "
5239,"<|emo_disgust|> He doesn't really lack in any other aspect, he just has issues with his footwork and quickness. "
5240,"<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst idea they can think of, and a bad one at that"
5241,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that’s disgusting
5242,"<|emo_disgust|> If they get [NAME] out, it'll be [NAME] fault for not running [NAME] and [NAME] in."
5243,"<|emo_disgust|> What a disgusting, offensive meme"
5244,<|emo_disgust|> I have found this to be one of the most infuriating things that can happen to me
5245,<|emo_disgust|> I actually believe they should just close the book and put it away.
5247,"<|emo_disgust|> That has to be the ""fucking sucks for you"" line, I haven't seen it before"
5248,<|emo_disgust|> There is a reason your account is broken.
5249,<|emo_disgust|> We should move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and swear fealty to the Holy City asusalem.
5250,<|emo_disgust|> So! They'd rather have [NAME] than [NAME].
5251,"<|emo_disgust|> Well it would be weird if our lord and savior was an actual [NAME], and he also had a son!"
5252,"<|emo_disgust|> It's just ""that other girl"" from the video that just had her backflipping for the last 4 seconds before getting her ngl flaccid"
5253,<|emo_disgust|> Well it's horrible but has more support since 2016. Pretty shit but works. Hope you enjoy it and I hope [NAME] does badly then.
5254,<|emo_disgust|> The last story is the saddest of the bunch
5255,<|emo_disgust|> Your ex girlfriend has been cheating on you for years and years. You need to let her know.
5256,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, they have more of a say in the culture now than people like [NAME] cared about when they were young. "
5257,<|emo_disgust|> I'm just going to make one final sarcastic comment about the music and call bullshit on everything you said about the show last night.
5260,<|emo_disgust|> I dont know how but this story of [NAME] is making me very happy.
5262,<|emo_disgust|> It'd be horrible if that game ended with [NAME] getting called for a doubtful technical
5263,<|emo_disgust|> It's a bad argument and you should be ashamed for championing it
5264,<|emo_disgust|> Lol ok you killed me🤣
5266,<|emo_disgust|> This post is fucking stupid.
5268,<|emo_disgust|> This is a good thing?
5269,"<|emo_disgust|> She is literally just a poor, insecure, jealous, abusive bitch."
5270,<|emo_disgust|> He didn’t care. He was more concerned with image than substance.
5271,<|emo_disgust|> Aaaaaand we got 9.000 downvotes for saying that.
5272,"<|emo_disgust|> That's the only way to kill it for sure, the other is by setting it on fire"
5273,"<|emo_disgust|> That's a lot of karma, [NAME]!"
5274,<|emo_disgust|> You have no clue what fascism is.
5275,"<|emo_disgust|> He’s just a scumbag, plain and simple. We’ve been seeing this for awhile now. Stop encouraging the ignorant here."
5276,<|emo_disgust|> You sound upset.
5277,<|emo_disgust|> Just so weird that the only thing you find disgusting about yourself is your dog's pee. I feel so bad.
5278,<|emo_disgust|> Now I'm wondering what that was.
5279,<|emo_disgust|> Why is it disgusting when a person doesn't do anything to deserve being called disgusting
5280,"<|emo_disgust|> I hate the whole ""calling a fat Dx"" thing. FTFY."
5282,<|emo_disgust|> My parents have been fighting since I was like 12. I feel like he has betrayed them.
5283,<|emo_disgust|> He’s so dumb.
5284,<|emo_disgust|> I don't agree. You're a horrible person for writing any of this.
5285,<|emo_disgust|> I am so disgusted that [NAME] used that as an insult. For shame
5286,<|emo_disgust|> My girlfriend hates me
5287,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME], that's so disgusting. I have no words."
5288,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird, never wirelessly share a burner with a burner"
5289,"<|emo_disgust|> She’s a horrible human being, period."
5290,<|emo_disgust|> And they'd be wrong about most things but they would be absolutely LITERALLY advocating for an income inequality that's dangerously regressive
5291,<|emo_disgust|> You're the worst kind of person trust me
5292,<|emo_disgust|> Holy crap that was definitely off Brooklyn
5293,<|emo_disgust|> That's a horrible start to the second half
5294,<|emo_disgust|> Oh shit. Didnt realize theyre allowed to have a camera in a car.
5295,<|emo_disgust|> i think i m feeling really tortured
5296,"<|emo_disgust|> A lot of people on here hate the police, which is maybe understandable since they are the ones who actually commit crimes."
5298,<|emo_disgust|> He has absolutely no business running for president.
5300,"<|emo_disgust|> i mean there are some people who may feel guilty but then also say ""i feel selfish too"" "
5301,<|emo_disgust|> That looks more like a Dumpster than a dumpster!
5303,"<|emo_disgust|> It’s like we were never meant to be friends, [NAME]"
5304,<|emo_disgust|> It really sucks how easily people are convinced by hype and lies. Scary stuff.
5305,<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest things they say about themselves.
5306,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is when you go outside without carrying any stuff with you.
5307,<|emo_disgust|> What did the rest of us learn in this episode? Did nothing? Did everything?
5309,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, the comment was so terrible. Who made that up?"
5310,<|emo_disgust|> i would feel like im being selfish
5311,"<|emo_disgust|> We have a president now, and it's fucking terrible."
5312,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, and the [NAME] deal looks worse than before"
5313,<|emo_disgust|> You want a job? Get out now and never look back.
5315,"<|emo_disgust|> And yet, most media just assume that these conservatives are a hate sub. It's so disgusting."
5316,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was a top 20 pick overall but he's been nothing but inconsistent this season. His shot isn't anything special in his game.
5317,<|emo_disgust|> > but there are those who support it Because they want to. Why are you angry?
5318,<|emo_disgust|> He seems a little distracted while driving in the area.
5319,<|emo_disgust|> I hate to say this but I love watching these turd cakes become more disgusting
5320,<|emo_disgust|> Worst advice ever. This is so cringy and bedazzling.
5321,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm a horrible human being, and I blame myself. "
5323,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is when she does that to you. I felt my heart drop.
5324,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a god damn monster.
5326,"<|emo_disgust|> I hope it's for the worst cause, but I'm worried it could backfire and cause more harm than good"
5327,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I have no idea what this is but I love it and want it so bad"""
5329,<|emo_disgust|> This is a really weird thing to be upset about. Maybe it's a sign that depression is more a state than a diagnosed medical condition. I'm not entirely sure.
5330,<|emo_disgust|> That’s horrible. I’m so sorry. 💜
5331,<|emo_disgust|> People always seem to try their luck and fail in life but I never really feel that way myself
5333,<|emo_disgust|> That's what I think I said but im awkward so yeah
5335,<|emo_disgust|> People there can't handle the truth. They crowd subreddit calling it a satire and saying it's disgusting.
5336,<|emo_disgust|> You're not.
5337,<|emo_disgust|> And those straws that are still hot after they have been shaken? Terrible.
5338,<|emo_disgust|> That's not even a full grown man!
5339,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah. The weird thing is I think I loved the show.... but then I realized something awful was going on. 
5340,<|emo_disgust|> I hate to say this but I love the Dallas Morning News and has this birthrate thing the hell figured out a ways.
5341,"<|emo_disgust|> He literally doesn’t even know what his plan is, let alone plans to do."
5342,<|emo_disgust|> Your sister should kill you.
5343,<|emo_disgust|> That was a really disgusting call
5344,<|emo_disgust|> Just so disgusting that [NAME] even had the nerve to use the N-word.
5346,<|emo_disgust|> There were racist morons everywhere.
5347,<|emo_disgust|> People are creepy
5348,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit...
5350,<|emo_disgust|> It’s a fact you’ve confused many many many people for your own entertainment. Stay out of Reddit though.
5351,<|emo_disgust|> This is so disgusting. I literally feel physically sick.
5352,<|emo_disgust|> My poor baby
5353,<|emo_disgust|> My god these refs actually not terrible this year. I’m so ecstatic.
5355,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn, that is dark"
5356,<|emo_disgust|> The new cars are hideous
5357,<|emo_disgust|> This was so ugly I felt personally attacked. #GarbageSite For Gays
5358,<|emo_disgust|> He must be creepy AF.
5359,"<|emo_disgust|> This is what Reddit finds ridiculous about this situation, the ridiculousness is surprising come across."
5360,"<|emo_disgust|> Your video cannot even meet the most basic standards, for starters"
5362,<|emo_disgust|> I'm so sorry. I'm a huge [NAME] fan and he was probably one of my favorite characters.
5363,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like im being abused i hate the world
5364,<|emo_disgust|> I hate this
5365,<|emo_disgust|> That’s so disgusting. I’m so sorry. 🙋
5366,<|emo_disgust|> I'm gonna read this out loud and point out that my entire thought was that this movie reminded me how awful fatness is
5367,"<|emo_disgust|> How dare they call their stores ""toys""? It's not right."
5368,<|emo_disgust|> The worst part is how nonchalant he seems to be. It's like his entire personality is based on this
5369,<|emo_disgust|> i feel weird for dating and loving someone when we dont have sex for a month
5370,<|emo_disgust|> My heart melted just reading these. Thank you
5371,"<|emo_disgust|> > I'm a man, stop taking advantage of women."
5372,"<|emo_disgust|> The fake news media. True, they don't shy away from bias. But still, that's a huge problem."
5373,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] just had his shirt pulled over his eyes and a guy on his facebook wall said “kicks his beer face”.
5374,<|emo_disgust|> This thread is becoming a hate sub
5375,<|emo_disgust|> It's disgusting that people believe things that aren't true 🤣
5376,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, we could have some great conversations here. "
5377,"<|emo_disgust|> It's like a hot take from the Right. ""A young black man was beaten and killed by a white neighborhood watchman because he looked black"" It's racist as all hell"
5379,<|emo_disgust|> I've never heard of a parent being charged for allowing their kid to bully them.
5380,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a mean bitch
5381,"<|emo_disgust|> It's weird how they do this, but it really doesn't make sense."
5382,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking moron lol
5383,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck off
5385,<|emo_disgust|> This article is stupid.
5386,<|emo_disgust|> She really did it! It was one of the worst swear words I’ve ever heard
5387,<|emo_disgust|> It seems like everyone is just jealous and doesn't really care how you got it
5388,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that is nice. Have a good one now
5390,"<|emo_disgust|> No, no, no! That's horrible news!..for Galaxy fans?"
5391,<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest thing is she also has the most upvoted comment of anyone on this sub
5392,<|emo_disgust|> i have a feeling they may have been intimidated
5394,<|emo_disgust|> How dare they! What an embarrassment!
5397,<|emo_disgust|> There's a special place in Hell for these kinds of people
5399,"<|emo_disgust|> No more [NAME] tbh, it's just badged [NAME] already."
5400,"<|emo_disgust|> And it wouldn't even stop, because that car is still going to kill you regardless of where one lives in the city like New York."
5401,<|emo_disgust|> Oh wow!!!
5402,<|emo_disgust|> But it looked way better on TV than it did in the movie
5403,<|emo_disgust|> So? How hard is it to suck someones balls?
5404,<|emo_disgust|> She’s not very good at her job
5405,<|emo_disgust|> What if we just called the cops and said our feelings were assaulted we dont want a shootout im sorry
5406,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm saying, [NAME], a weirdo is one of my closer friends. It's really weird."
5407,<|emo_disgust|> I have seen all these people blogging and even I am wondering what the problem is lol
5408,<|emo_disgust|> I can’t get off the phone!!!
5409,<|emo_disgust|> What a bummer. I wish I had this game.
5411,<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck are you on about now...tf is that?
5412,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so fucking petty so completely petty
5413,"<|emo_disgust|> That's such a selfish mentality to have, to think you're so important to him you'd rather lie than play the game by the book?"
5414,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I hope you are doing better now.
5415,<|emo_disgust|> But it is! I love it and I have a boyfriend!
5416,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, the comments on this thread are a little on the things to say compared to the likes here. "
5417,<|emo_disgust|> Whataburger misses you
5418,<|emo_disgust|> Holy crap!!
5419,<|emo_disgust|> You could've also said it made sense if you ignored how much [NAME] hates [NAME] and just hated 'em for their own good.
5420,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is just another example of a racist, ignorant, MAGA-loving, ignorant, bigoted, bigot, racist, ignorant, sexist, homophobe, anti-intellectual, ignorant, bigot, racist, ignorant, homophobe, anti-science, ignorant, bigot"
5421,<|emo_disgust|> What in the hell?
5422,<|emo_disgust|> The worst part of this is that she didn't even give a shit!! What a cuck!
5423,<|emo_disgust|> He was never a fascist. He's a moron.
5424,<|emo_disgust|> It's really hard to make any friends.
5425,<|emo_disgust|> So much anger and hate towards everyone and everything in this world...
5426,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a bastard.
5427,<|emo_disgust|> I've been a [NAME] fan since the third grade so even before we lost [NAME] to the Leafs at the end of the season all I can think of is how devastated I was when I heard [NAME] was leaving
5429,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn his name is O.o
5430,<|emo_disgust|> And here's my bad response because I was frustrated.
5431,<|emo_disgust|> That's worse. You're about to go through a lot worse
5433,<|emo_disgust|> i guess because i was feeling so grouchy
5434,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing bigger than a rotten egg is the person I hate.
5435,<|emo_disgust|> i would love him i would feel disgusted
5436,"<|emo_disgust|> It's not about being racist, it's that they're racists because they're racist."
5437,<|emo_disgust|> The only one who got it worse was [NAME] I think.
5438,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking right let’s go [NAME]
5439,<|emo_disgust|> Because I can’t get a job I wanted without killing the neighbors.
5440,"<|emo_disgust|> She wants to be known as the girl that had her throat cut, not the girl that had her throat cut."
5441,<|emo_disgust|> That’s so creepy. How old is her baby?
5442,"<|emo_disgust|> And then it ceases to be a question of whether or not to have sex, but whether or not you want to have sex at all."
5443,<|emo_disgust|> >The top one has him getting beaten up by a bear
5444,<|emo_disgust|> But he’s horrible
5445,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that this is the top comment says it all. Hate Reddit.
5446,<|emo_disgust|> I think I’m going to throw up
5447,<|emo_disgust|> Owe him.
5448,<|emo_disgust|> > It sounds like you were really dissatisfied with your education.
5450,"<|emo_disgust|> You know what I really hate? People who actually take the time to do their research. Like in this thread, who were just looking for a ""10 rules of dating"" for men"
5451,<|emo_disgust|> And you can't hate anyone because your parents did the same damn thing.
5452,<|emo_disgust|> We're not doing well...
5453,<|emo_disgust|> If it werent for them I wouldnt have had it in me to try as hard that day. My body can handle it xD
5454,<|emo_disgust|> Oh stop it already!
5456,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh that's so disgusting. I hope you understand that what you did was illegal and will consequences, and that you will learn from your actions."
5457,<|emo_disgust|> They're all so awful
5458,<|emo_disgust|> This team needs to tighten up in the third. Literally every turnover theaways commit has the potential to end badly for them.
5459,<|emo_disgust|> This is so incredibly creepy. Good riddance to awful rubbish.
5462,<|emo_disgust|> Damn the Bengals are horrible
5464,"<|emo_disgust|> This guy gets it better than [NAME] but does it matter? [NAME] can't make a lick of difference to this guy, but he can hopefully cause him to become more hesitant in future."
5465,<|emo_disgust|> I have a feeling he'll regret this comment
5467,<|emo_disgust|> Oh what a horrible list
5470,<|emo_disgust|> i was feeling really dissatisfied with the way things were going for me and it was frustrating so i felt that this was probably not way out of our league
5471,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Fuck the cowgirls"" "
5472,"<|emo_disgust|> If you're that extreme, I'm afraid you're an even worse example of a racist."
5473,"<|emo_disgust|> No, that's a lie "
5475,<|emo_disgust|> Oof nsfw that makes me want to die
5476,<|emo_disgust|> i feel very insulted
5477,<|emo_disgust|> Wow that’s terrible! You should probably start taking care of yourself.
5478,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you! out with the old!
5479,<|emo_disgust|> This person is crazy
5480,<|emo_disgust|> This is my favorite scene from Kill Your Darlings.
5481,<|emo_disgust|> I'm crying.
5482,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm a little worried for [NAME] considering he used to be this way, but he seems like a genuinely nice guy. "
5483,<|emo_disgust|> This is just awful...
5484,<|emo_disgust|> She reminds me of the crazy ex-friend from high school from whom I later fell in love.
5485,<|emo_disgust|> It's a fucking ad
5486,"<|emo_disgust|> I didn't believe it then, but I now...."
5487,<|emo_disgust|> No thanks....I hate it
5488,<|emo_disgust|> She's in terrible shape and I'm loving it.
5489,<|emo_disgust|> It was horrible. BGs on mobile are bad
5490,<|emo_disgust|> You're saying the exact same thing about most of them soooo yeah go out and become a [NAME]!
5492,<|emo_disgust|> Lol no.... She’s just a crazy mommy on how self centered she is.
5493,<|emo_disgust|> Those are some disgusting feet.
5495,<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell thought he was injured or anything
5496,<|emo_disgust|> She also has the dubious honor of being the only Women's March to be honored by the Southern Poverty Law center.
5497,<|emo_disgust|> The best kind of advice is never to go to Reddit in the first place.
5498,<|emo_disgust|> She's a weirdo.
5499,<|emo_disgust|> In what world do these people have real world experience? None. They are ignorant fool. Shame.
5501,<|emo_disgust|> I don't think either of them realised what the other had said. She did give him some money though
5502,<|emo_disgust|> Just make sure your boyfriend's comfortable in there.
5503,<|emo_disgust|> The secondhand panic and embarrassment I feel is real
5504,<|emo_disgust|> No thanks the next day is when i realized i had made a terrible mistake.
5505,<|emo_disgust|> I think you're too stupid to know that the original is twice as long and it includes his weird introduction.
5506,<|emo_disgust|> Damn you [NAME]...
5507,<|emo_disgust|> I just hate him.
5508,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't care what anyone says. I love me some RFM, but this seems pretty dumb and unrepresentative of what we've been hearing."
5509,<|emo_disgust|> They hate him!
5510,<|emo_disgust|> This is how you get a drunk girl to end a relationship with your best friend.
5511,<|emo_disgust|> You had it coming. Foul play and all that
5512,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has been in a few bad movies in his career that leave him feeling quite damaged physically.
5515,"<|emo_disgust|> I know it’s a weird thing to say, but I love my state like all the rest of the country do. "
5518,"<|emo_disgust|> But still, the US has a bigger military and spending per capita than Russia. What a shame."
5519,"<|emo_disgust|> >it's because he's a psychopath. Aghh, the only thing that could explain his actions other than his mental disorder is him being a psychopath."
5520,<|emo_disgust|> Weird how all the problems in the world don't impact you at all. This is the part of life where some people can't handle it or can't accept it.
5521,<|emo_disgust|> The only loser here is you
5522,<|emo_disgust|> You are an awful human being.
5524,<|emo_disgust|> No you want to rape and torture children
5525,<|emo_disgust|> Don't hate the Sun. Good paper but their attack dog is worse
5526,<|emo_disgust|> That’s just an excuse to not care about any of the important issues facing [NAME] country. That goes for everything
5528,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so tortured by it all
5529,<|emo_disgust|> When I was a kid I hated being told what to do and feeling pressured into doing it.
5530,<|emo_disgust|> Now THIS IS bad
5531,<|emo_disgust|> If it's about drug dealing I'm appalled you would link to it.
5532,"<|emo_disgust|> This video is a further proof of the hate in these parts, it only proves the growing discontent"
5533,<|emo_disgust|> I’m getting this with a lot of my friends
5535,<|emo_disgust|> Don’t get me wrong it’s great I hate the traffic but.....
5537,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] that's terrible. And the username...oh [NAME] those are the signs I'm getting old.
5539,<|emo_disgust|> Just eat your goddamn veggies man
5541,<|emo_disgust|> I'm really just aghast at how long it took [NAME] to say this.
5542,<|emo_disgust|> This might be one of the creepiest I've seen.
5543,<|emo_disgust|> Who's making me paranoid?
5544,<|emo_disgust|> When should you mention how many people died in the holocaust? Not once. Not ever once was this mention. It was an extremely important aspect of the film.
5545,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was an absolute monster. I loved watching him.
5548,<|emo_disgust|> It's pretty weird when you look at the top of that bar you will come face to face with a person who is 6 feet tall but has arms as long as your back
5549,"<|emo_disgust|> The “antibiotics are killing him” part killed me, I hated it because it’s true :)"
5550,<|emo_disgust|> i feel kind of petty admitting that i actually did
5551,"<|emo_disgust|> The real worst though is when the game actually stops, while you were alive."
5552,<|emo_disgust|> So disgusting.vomit.over.the.balls.of.him.
5553,<|emo_disgust|> It was a bad copy paste from the reddit news post
5554,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is so obnoxious but the only thing he does are ask questions and he does them in such a condescending voice
5555,<|emo_disgust|> She is a very dangerous woman.
5558,<|emo_disgust|> I don't have to live in a bubble then how the fuck do you live with such people huh?
5559,<|emo_disgust|> She can't pick and choose what she wants to do for herself. She is not a woman.
5560,<|emo_disgust|> She’s definitely a bitch. But I’m fine with that. You’re a sweet Mom. I’m glad your okay now. 
5561,<|emo_disgust|> I think the third picture is equally bad.
5562,<|emo_disgust|> That's the worst job I've ever had to do.
5563,<|emo_disgust|> The one throwing a party at the abandoned minefield known as Dobbler [NAME]
5564,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch! I hit him where the tooth is! *scratches chin*
5565,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is fucking destroying Bournemouth
5566,<|emo_disgust|> It’s about 4 feet away from them right now. Get out now!
5567,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking asshole lol.
5568,"<|emo_disgust|> That's pretty lewd, let alone that send it to a wholesome subreddit. You're disgusting"
5569,<|emo_disgust|> No because we want the rich to get more money and be more stupid
5570,<|emo_disgust|> They can't possibly understand that.
5571,"<|emo_disgust|> My cat just attacked me for treats and scratched me on the finger. If he's that dangerous, I'd take the treats and put him inside a kennel."
5572,<|emo_disgust|> Don't I love [NAME]?!
5574,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds awful.
5575,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucken n
5576,<|emo_disgust|> The second picture in that list is worse.
5577,"<|emo_disgust|> This is creepy, but also quite funny as the person who posted it is a relatively new arrival to the area."
5578,<|emo_disgust|> You are stupid.
5580,<|emo_disgust|> A few months ago I would have taken that shot. Hard pass now.
5582,<|emo_disgust|> She's a monster...
5583,<|emo_disgust|> This is so disgusting. Wider and further.
5584,<|emo_disgust|> You’re creepy
5585,"<|emo_disgust|> No, you are a horrible person for making those claims."
5586,<|emo_disgust|> You're so ugly
5587,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you link to a porn company. Your an idiot and there isnt much else you can say.
5588,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird that many games assume you pick one party/vote style over another.
5589,<|emo_disgust|> Because there's a good chance she'll end up regretting it.
5590,"<|emo_disgust|> She went on a Reddit AMA her dude said he's a terrible and extremely impressionable girl, and she just wants you to be friends with her."
5591,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a weird case study in how a company or even a individual can be incredibly evil and completely oblivious to the absolute awfulness of their ways
5592,<|emo_disgust|> It's so ridiculous the way he wrote it but I still love AS3
5593,<|emo_disgust|> i feel very angry about that
5594,"<|emo_disgust|> They said it was a ""filler episode"". Fuck off."
5595,<|emo_disgust|> He must have seen the back of her tooth. She really didn't seem to care.
5596,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is such a fucking scumbag with no self-control and is only getting more disgusting as the season goes on and it gets worse and worse
5597,"<|emo_disgust|> He did it to excuse his bad behavior. Which, honestly, is pretty awful."
5598,"<|emo_disgust|> My heart aches for you, [NAME]!!"
5599,<|emo_disgust|> What the hell.
5601,<|emo_disgust|> You're right. I've said it before - if it's not on there it's not in my head.
5602,<|emo_disgust|> It's a weird thing to say to someone with depression.
5603,<|emo_disgust|> Not sure how we're expected to win at home without him.
5604,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was horrible... I loved the JV players but he was god awful
5605,<|emo_disgust|> That's rude. I hope he does the other one worse.
5606,<|emo_disgust|> Because it's creepy.
5607,<|emo_disgust|> That looks sick!
5609,<|emo_disgust|> She’s ugly
5611,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, this is the first I've seen of this. I'm super angry."
5612,<|emo_disgust|> That’s too many pills
5613,<|emo_disgust|> I’ve never seen an animal so sickly and deformed!
5614,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like i have no idea what to do
5615,<|emo_disgust|> He was probably agitated and crying in his car while waiting to be towed.
5616,"<|emo_disgust|> What a disgusting, cringy, sexist, racist piece of shit 🤣 "
5617,<|emo_disgust|> This guy should go to HELL
5619,"<|emo_disgust|> No, what’s weird is you’re talking about a child. You’re a horrible, disgusting person"
5622,<|emo_disgust|> She should be FIRED
5623,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is not a football fan. He is a man hating racist who hates the South and specifically the Southern South.
5624,"<|emo_disgust|> We're not beating them 100% of the time, and it's really not their fault. The only thing we're trying to do is stop them from destroying the natural world. "
5625,<|emo_disgust|> I had to laugh hard because this made me look bad atwork.
5627,<|emo_disgust|> He does have a long history of making sexist and racist comments...
5628,"<|emo_disgust|> People are gross, ugly, lazy creatures that deserve all of the blame."
5629,<|emo_disgust|> OHHH FUCK YESSS CJJJJJJ IT'S GONE ALL AWAY
5630,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has given us some sweet looks.
5631,<|emo_disgust|> What's your relationship like??? Like how old is your baby? I don't know if you're aware of this but like I'd be surprised if she's less than 2 months old.
5632,<|emo_disgust|> No. They’re awful.
5633,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so fucking annoyed by this
5634,<|emo_disgust|> If I was running away from what was happening I would be freaking out!
5635,<|emo_disgust|> Because it's a publicity stunt for a porn company. Lmfao
5637,<|emo_disgust|> Don't listen to much prog or hardcore though. This shit is pure garbage.
5638,"<|emo_disgust|> He was going to his car at the stoplight. You guys need to calm down, your son just went 30 miles an hour and nearly killed someone."
5639,<|emo_disgust|> It's always seems creepy and weird when these lines come up while watching him onfy 😂
5640,<|emo_disgust|> I'm so sorry. He seemed so emo and insecure.
5641,<|emo_disgust|> You’re a disgusting piece
5642,<|emo_disgust|> No no. All your friends are assholes
5644,"<|emo_disgust|> Your boyfriend has spent the last month-and-a-half in your flat, disturbing you and not leaving your side."
5645,<|emo_disgust|> I want to see them punished more for this
5648,<|emo_disgust|> This kid could write an article about it...
5649,"<|emo_disgust|> He seems like he actually doesnt care. ""I want to tell the man what he will experience in his life."" ""Fuck that"""
5650,<|emo_disgust|> That woman should be outed to the world. Imagine the stench that'll waft up from her grave if she keeps doing this to other women.
5651,<|emo_disgust|> Omg yes. What a nightmare.
5652,<|emo_disgust|> And yet the left are saying it's racist.
5653,"<|emo_disgust|> It's called being an asshole, I don't care who you are. "
5654,"<|emo_disgust|> That's some bullshit defense for a guy that goes 6'11""."
5655,<|emo_disgust|> My fault too for not being up for the weekend. That sucks.
5656,<|emo_disgust|> > So so obnoxious.
5657,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, probably a little too hard for the first couple, but the second couple are pretty damn good."
5658,<|emo_disgust|> This is like [NAME] episode where [NAME] is a moron.
5659,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I can't stand these"" ""I don't know this"""
5660,<|emo_disgust|> I hate the new intro song. Same as the old one. So boring
5661,<|emo_disgust|> And what the fuck? Who decided that shit was fine?
5662,<|emo_disgust|> Wow just wow. I feel personally attacked
5663,<|emo_disgust|> Your wife is an awful human being.
5664,<|emo_disgust|> That was their first lousy loss in nearly four months. It gets worse.
5665,<|emo_disgust|> I don't care what men say because I'm a MAN and I'm going to get you another beer.
5667,"<|emo_disgust|> Not being hateful toward anyones' religion or beliefs, but...heh"
5668,"<|emo_disgust|> What's weird is she says, you know it was *about* him, but when it comes time to hook the girl up... I have no idea "
5669,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is fucking embarrassing.
5670,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is just bad at his job
5671,<|emo_disgust|> What nonsense. The Conservatives did it all the time. It was Labour that started it.
5672,"<|emo_disgust|> He doesn't. He just likes to scream ""IS IT REALLY FUCKING CRY!"" when people don't understand what cruaymaw is"
5673,<|emo_disgust|> i cant help but feel envious and i sometimes look at the other kids
5674,<|emo_disgust|> Damn what a bummer. I’d give it another year if I could. I’ve played against enough worse than this.
5675,<|emo_disgust|> I think everyone just has a bad image for what it's like to be a woman in that environment.
5676,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, there's literally a body double for every [NAME]. "
5677,"<|emo_disgust|> How is a ""loss of rights? How is it a right?!"" How is that Not Predatory on the part of the owner!!!"
5678,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is having two parents with the same opinion.
5679,"<|emo_disgust|> Holy crap, even though I'm fairly new to this, it's already giving me some flashbacks to when I used to play."
5680,<|emo_disgust|> This is me every time I read about these people in the news. Don't tell me what to think.
5681,"<|emo_disgust|> You don't want the truth, you wantlockerheart maga in your box."
5682,<|emo_disgust|> Those were some of the worst defendins I've ever seen. The only thing keeping them from being awesome is the fact that they didn't have lineups like that.
5683,<|emo_disgust|> It’s creepy that he thinks like that.
5684,<|emo_disgust|> So what you are saying is that [NAME] is a racist is you racist.
5685,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling very irritated today
5686,"<|emo_disgust|> If he hadn't done so, then I wouldn't be so quick to sentence him. I still think that he's a dangerous man. "
5688,<|emo_disgust|> If you find it offensive then perhaps it isn't for you.
5691,<|emo_disgust|> This is the one and only time I've ever felt sexual attraction to a man in my life...
5693,<|emo_disgust|> A girl who has justifiably gone out and wed a guy (and I don't give a damn about your age)..
5695,"<|emo_disgust|> My biggest issue with this is [NAME] saying about 3rd party candidates ""they don't get to talk about policy."" "
5697,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME], y'all don't know what I know about the subject matter, thanks we don't wanna go back."
5698,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, I’m sick of these questions."
5699,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking douchebag.
5700,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] this is so creepy
5702,"<|emo_disgust|> But if it's bad, the media will blame the [NAME]. It's so ridiculous."
5703,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is really bad and his defense is really bad, he really is..."
5705,<|emo_disgust|> How are you able to not vomit?
5706,<|emo_disgust|> > There is a growing number of dissatisfied with the political situation in the east lalia
5707,<|emo_disgust|> What a disgusting load of old shite.
5708,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm a woman, don't assume, it will change your mind. I hope it does though"
5709,<|emo_disgust|> I hate crows!!!!
5710,<|emo_disgust|> Your a disgusting disgusting piece of filth.
5711,"<|emo_disgust|> What's the difference? For example, if milk is from cows fed grass, what's the difference? It's dairy. All else equal, grass is better for you."
5712,"<|emo_disgust|> This is extremely creepy. An adulteress is just an old, dirty hooker."
5713,"<|emo_disgust|> > We already knew about the ""aggressively typed"" girl. So what?"
5714,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is getting ready to leave
5715,"<|emo_disgust|> You don't need to do that, the kids have done this to you!"
5716,<|emo_disgust|> i feel rather hateful because of this
5717,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, and I do resent how much I've accepted that."
5719,<|emo_disgust|> Now let me just hit fuck you [NAME]
5721,"<|emo_disgust|> They had a tough loss due to kickoffs, special teams, and missed field goals. "
5722,<|emo_disgust|> That’s crazy! I’m quite new to this but I have good friends
5723,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, she must really suck in her accent."
5724,<|emo_disgust|> I think it might be safe to say that this man is a quite unpleasant and frankly disgusting individual both personally and socially.
5725,<|emo_disgust|> Not to mention that the person I met last week was just as angry and miserable as him.
5726,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing is not having a plan B.
5727,<|emo_disgust|> I'm fucking starving here.
5728,<|emo_disgust|> He's such a nasty POS.
5730,<|emo_disgust|> Wow I had so many expectations for this movie..... I was wrong. Good job
5731,"<|emo_disgust|> They’re either disgusting liars or worse. Either way, I don’t support them and hope they lose in November."
5733,"<|emo_disgust|> The people at sites like this are a little weird and uncomfortable, and a little bad for internet culture overall."
5734,<|emo_disgust|> I’m afraid I will.
5736,<|emo_disgust|> What a sick burn
5737,"<|emo_disgust|> She was not ""shoved into"" a wall. She was physically pushed and shoved and intimidated."
5738,<|emo_disgust|> I was going to say this but I think it's more trolling than anything else
5739,<|emo_disgust|> You get a bad BOTW for being an obnoxious cunt.
5740,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, how dare people tell you what to do - that's their job! Your boss, however, is your responsibility!"
5741,"<|emo_disgust|> When he was a little kid, his dad would always ask when he was going to ""watch an old man fiddle with screwdrivers"""
5742,"<|emo_disgust|> >I know a man who loves hot dogs because he also hates [NAME], a disgusting burger monster "
5744,<|emo_disgust|> Oh I hate that too.
5745,<|emo_disgust|> This is a hot story. What The actual fuck.
5746,<|emo_disgust|> i want to feel like a fucking horrible person
5747,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, that’s just a terrible list."
5748,"<|emo_disgust|> The third picture is creepy, makes me want to run away"
5749,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, that's dark"
5750,<|emo_disgust|> > Which is odd because her husband is a weirdo known for his racist views.
5751,<|emo_disgust|> You're a awful human being.
5752,<|emo_disgust|> She is so gorgeous.
5753,<|emo_disgust|> They don't mind so long as it goes to [NAME] for and [NAME] to give the world [NAME] and [NAME] on the world stage as a real-life JV team.
5754,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh yeah, the stupid abiotic stuff"
5755,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck man I gotta go watch The Big Short right now
5757,<|emo_disgust|> They’re both horrible
5758,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing that's worse than having been abused is having to live with it.
5759,<|emo_disgust|> So fucking heart warming! Brother love man it’s wholesome as shit.
5761,<|emo_disgust|> I can’t stand [NAME]
5762,"<|emo_disgust|> No they don’t, because as you point out, ""stupid people"" won’t understand social issues or will give you a sympathetic hearing. "
5763,"<|emo_disgust|> This is a sad video. Kids these days are much, much worse."
5764,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, this is dope."
5766,"<|emo_disgust|> No. What if I said that it was awful, but I couldn't imagine that all the people in that room would do that? "
5767,<|emo_disgust|> I want to hear my mom explain why they called it a ‘bodysnatchers’
5768,"<|emo_disgust|> If it isn't broken, it is probably use abused."
5769,<|emo_disgust|> Wow that’s awful. I’d like to go back if I lived in the area. That’s awful.
5770,"<|emo_disgust|> It’s just “bad news” for climate change, huh?"
5771,"<|emo_disgust|> >and [NAME] got to spend the year with his aunt, [NAME]"
5772,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing is his music video for the single. Directed by an incredibly dumb and obnoxious [NAME] it's garbage
5774,<|emo_disgust|> Oh no! You're the one who sucks!!
5776,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is in for a miserable year
5777,<|emo_disgust|> i want to feel this kind of tortured anxiety
5779,<|emo_disgust|> What a bummer that we are gonna have a new manager in two years and this is probably the biggest thing holding them back now...
5780,<|emo_disgust|> This is so disgusting. I find it's disgusting that in 31 states and DC you can smoke weed and drive.
5783,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is when they don’t actually say their prayers or anything throughout the evening.
5784,<|emo_disgust|> You know the rest of the story
5785,<|emo_disgust|> That looks disgusting
5788,<|emo_disgust|> This doesn’t make any sense.... I hate this so much.
5789,<|emo_disgust|> I'm a bad democrat and an even worse republican.
5791,<|emo_disgust|> The weird thing is that the majority of them are college/graduate students
5792,<|emo_disgust|> Shut up you shill /s
5793,<|emo_disgust|> Lol. That's awful.
5794,<|emo_disgust|> This is horrible... One of my worst nightmares actually.
5795,<|emo_disgust|> But it still sounds so terrible.
5797,<|emo_disgust|> No hate TGR I am just saying it
5799,<|emo_disgust|> That one looks like it was made with a saw or something. Looks really bad.
5800,<|emo_disgust|> A little tip if you see a lot of weird posts/posts about dating. Get out there.
5802,<|emo_disgust|> Oh damn that!
5804,<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry that can't happen in your homestate. We probably all share the same feelings about losing to a super power
5805,"<|emo_disgust|> How is he going to hit you if you're not grounded? Your hands are bigger than his. Also, he is just not very experienced."
5806,<|emo_disgust|> i have a feeling i was wronged in that opinion
5807,<|emo_disgust|> What absolute garbage
5808,<|emo_disgust|> Just go home already. This post made me want to throw up.
5809,<|emo_disgust|> That's a lot of karma. You'd think they'd be less generous with the money they get for their votes.
5810,<|emo_disgust|> That’s just sick.
5811,<|emo_disgust|> But it's the worst when it doesn't apply. The UK is awful at getting unfair advantage chargesiated of people with the same address.
5812,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh dear, [NAME] is back..."
5813,<|emo_disgust|> So true. I hated everything about him at the time.
5814,"<|emo_disgust|> This is like the movie ""IT'S HELL IN HELL INSIDE"""
5815,<|emo_disgust|> i feel really hated that god made me like some other guy as well
5816,<|emo_disgust|> When they call you [NAME] and you call them [NAME].... they get pissed. They get pissed because they don't get paid.
5817,<|emo_disgust|> If he didn’t take his daughter to the dentist then what the fuck is he doing up there
5818,<|emo_disgust|> You need to see this!!!
5819,<|emo_disgust|> >I just feel so fucking stupid for not knowing this.
5820,<|emo_disgust|> Oh no its [NAME].
5823,"<|emo_disgust|> It’s so weird that we have the same amount of playoff wins as them this year, wow."
5825,<|emo_disgust|> I am truly sorry that you are feeling so financially insecure.
5826,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is when she goes back to her old boyfriend/boyfriend. What a cringeworthy relationship.
5827,<|emo_disgust|> No one ever said [NAME] was worse than [NAME]. Stop saying anything negative against [NAME] and [NAME]
5829,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is when that sweet teen you once knew gets caught.
5831,<|emo_disgust|> I've heard that is a real thing. I'm in my early 20s and it's even worse.
5832,<|emo_disgust|> Aaaand everybody got diarrhea.
5833,"<|emo_disgust|> Why is this getting downvoted. I totally agree, but it's just utterly infuriating."
5834,<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting. Toelicking. Wtf is wrong with people?
5835,<|emo_disgust|> This is one of the worst I've seen. Poor [NAME].
5837,"<|emo_disgust|> No, she definitely looks awful."
5838,<|emo_disgust|> What a weird way to think about things.
5839,<|emo_disgust|> i actually feel agitated a lot lately like i m waiting for the internet to actually take its course
5841,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fucking BITCH
5843,<|emo_disgust|> I swear Denver has the worst sports media personalities.
5844,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn it, [NAME] isn't living up to his word and he needs to be let out of here. "
5845,<|emo_disgust|> Not so much. I did feel personally attacked.
5846,<|emo_disgust|> > he's going to be around for a *much* longer time than I imagine I've been alive That's just damn creepy.
5847,<|emo_disgust|> Who is [NAME]
5848,"<|emo_disgust|> They would have done better in that movie. Actually, I like [NAME] as a person. But it just seemed so rushed."
5850,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a disgusting bimbo
5851,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling extremely dissatisfied with myself
5852,<|emo_disgust|> Well that poor janitor.
5853,<|emo_disgust|> People are disgusting and insane.
5854,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck [NAME].
5855,<|emo_disgust|> You're weird
5857,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking moron.
5859,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was in the worst of the first period and I'm shaking and crying. That's right, we should all just shut up"
5861,<|emo_disgust|> Oh.
5866,<|emo_disgust|> Well done. I like it. Have fun.
5868,<|emo_disgust|> She's the wrong age and looks like the owner of a dog she neglects and treats like a toy. Sad. 
5869,<|emo_disgust|> >[NAME] are a hate sub.
5870,"<|emo_disgust|> When he went to prison, he said he doesn't remember how old he is"
5871,<|emo_disgust|> There you go I fixed it. I swear you did not read the text of article you are critical thinking asshat
5872,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] looks just as bad as [NAME] in terms of pure awesomeness, what a fucking nfl moron"
5873,"<|emo_disgust|> This is the scariest thing I think I’ve read on this sub today. They say be afraid of what you don’t understand, but I think it is [RELIGION]."
5874,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah right. I thought it was weird that she doesn't actually say anything in the scene but I guess she doesn't want to cause much of a scene and is just being a nice girl to get attention
5878,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm not an [NAME]. I like the term ""third party"" a lot. Unfortunately it's become something referring to a voting bloc and not a movement within a movement."
5879,<|emo_disgust|> The weird way this photo was taken... Makes it look like a shaky picture...
5880,"<|emo_disgust|> If he wants to know how a girl treats him, she should stop with that. It's rude."
5882,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is such a fucking selfish prick.
5885,<|emo_disgust|> Because it's a cruel and absurdly effective ad hominem.
5886,"<|emo_disgust|> That sounds awful. I’m so sorry for your loss. Also, I can barely drink coffee right now but this is definitely something I would try."
5887,<|emo_disgust|> That is so disgusting. You'd be shocked what these people can range in age from...
5888,<|emo_disgust|> Wow I’ve sat like all that
5889,<|emo_disgust|> They're a couple days older than [NAME] and [NAME] and it's totally their fault and they need to be punished for their selfishness.
5890,"<|emo_disgust|> Just as important is the fact that if there is a better player in that draft class who we take No. 1 than [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], or [NAME]... that only hurts us further."
5892,"<|emo_disgust|> Not the worst, just really hard to pick that one one. The ones that are really cringy tend to be older movies"
5893,<|emo_disgust|> That’s disgusting. Can’t imagine thinking that is OK.
5894,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I don’t have any friends.
5896,<|emo_disgust|> Wow. That's quite a lot worse tbh with the defective airbag.
5897,<|emo_disgust|> Weird as hell
5898,<|emo_disgust|> What an idiot.
5899,<|emo_disgust|> You're a monster!!!!
5900,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a fucking idiot
5901,<|emo_disgust|> What bothers you?
5903,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn. I'm sorry, what?"
5904,"<|emo_disgust|> If it is ""sincerely held"" I'm appalled that your company requires them to. Stop being so gatekeeper and get rid of them yourself."
5907,"<|emo_disgust|> It's also why I hate today and tomorrow. Because these days are the worst, because there are no awful days on this earth"
5908,<|emo_disgust|> If it's the playoffs and he's going against [NAME] for the reigns I'm already lost. Worst case scenario here is he gets hurt
5910,<|emo_disgust|> I am about to die.
5912,"<|emo_disgust|> You didn't respond to my comments, so I'm going to assume you're a horrible person and nothing you say should make you any better."
5913,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fuckin monster
5914,<|emo_disgust|> Don't you're making me paranoid man
5915,"<|emo_disgust|> No thanks, don't blame me if I die. "
5916,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, I like my gun better, and I'm not a hater."
5917,<|emo_disgust|> They were literally shooting each other for the last 2 seconds before pulling out the.50 cal.
5918,<|emo_disgust|> And yet [NAME] is on fire!!!
5919,<|emo_disgust|> Oh that's so disgusting. No one should do that to their children.
5920,<|emo_disgust|> Omg stop spamming
5921,<|emo_disgust|> Wow that’s awful. I’m so sorry you had to go through that.
5923,<|emo_disgust|> Weird shit i just wrote because I don't like it
5924,"<|emo_disgust|> I've felt this too. When I was growing up, I considered myself Weird Al because I liked Weird Albuter XD"
5926,"<|emo_disgust|> I feel like the worst troll ever, but not by a long shot..."
5927,<|emo_disgust|> My god the neck movement. What in the world is going on
5928,"<|emo_disgust|> That’s worse, she has a good Life to worry about"
5929,<|emo_disgust|> Not just his record but the way he talks.
5930,"<|emo_disgust|> I think you can see his frustration. ""Dude, why are you allowing this to be here?"" "
5931,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, your mom is a weirdo."
5932,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn I wish [NAME] could show [NAME] how easy it is to fuck a woman.
5933,<|emo_disgust|> That’s a lot of ketchup.
5934,"<|emo_disgust|> I feel the same way. I'm a bit of a romantic, and it's pretty gross to see that I went in thinking I could be with just anyone."
5935,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is hurting the Broncos this offseason, and not in a good way"
5936,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a weirdo I guess?
5937,<|emo_disgust|> Because it's creepy and weird and slightly embarrassing?
5938,<|emo_disgust|> That's creepy.
5939,<|emo_disgust|> She was so horrible
5940,<|emo_disgust|> That is an extreme example of something that isn't harassment. harassment is using your body as a weapon on someone who isn't you.
5941,<|emo_disgust|> This is so cute. You can tell he is 7 by the way the dog is curled up at his feet.
5942,<|emo_disgust|> That's a terrible amount of Sesame oil.
5943,"<|emo_disgust|> I still miss out on the possibility of a Thrashers vs subs, so that sucks but at least the game will be closer."
5945,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is when you learn something is literally false. Like [NAME] said...
5946,<|emo_disgust|> The reason I hate Twitter is because everything is about status quo on there. It's just a giant echo chamber for opinionated morons.
5947,<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry you are dealing with so many other negative thoughts. I'm here to listen.
5948,<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest thing about this is that we are giving them two free shrooms... Which they obviously don't want...
5949,<|emo_disgust|> It sounds spasticated.
5950,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]! How dare you put xanax in a shake!
5951,"<|emo_disgust|> Just get the hell out, its expensive"
5952,<|emo_disgust|> This is the nba’ worst possible arena
5953,<|emo_disgust|> They must really hate themselves.
5954,<|emo_disgust|> And the list goes on... if you happen to be one of those people you are a hero to the universe by using karma you bastard.
5955,"<|emo_disgust|> And, most importantly, fuck [NAME] ass. "
5956,"<|emo_disgust|> I know all about it haha, they keep their power tools inside the truck!"
5957,<|emo_disgust|> Oh. That last one makes my skin crawl.
5958,<|emo_disgust|> This is worse than a horror movie tbh. I'm so scared to watch it
5960,"<|emo_disgust|> I’d take a kiss on the throat, then put my head in his face"
5961,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck all that.
5962,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I haven’t been paying much attention lately but I’m scared for the future of video game podcasting.
5963,<|emo_disgust|> You’re the worst kind of person.
5964,<|emo_disgust|> Your dad's an idiot.
5965,"<|emo_disgust|> The more you dig, the more disgusting it gets."
5966,<|emo_disgust|> i have been feeling somewhat insulted by the level of ignorance the media seems to feel about the matters concerned
5967,<|emo_disgust|> It's a shame they don't have an option for upvoting.
5968,<|emo_disgust|> What. The. Fresh. Fuck.
5971,<|emo_disgust|> They want you to like them but not share the same beliefs. It's obnoxious.
5972,"<|emo_disgust|> If anything, the subreddit was more focused on their usual suspects, posting about their favourite bands."
5973,<|emo_disgust|> What a stupid country.
5975,<|emo_disgust|> People are getting paid to hate them and the fake media is playing along to try and make it all better.
5976,"<|emo_disgust|> No, but apparently his brother did. "
5977,<|emo_disgust|> This is creepy and weird. If you go to a church services you'll probably be meeting with a weird old man.
5979,<|emo_disgust|> That guy just had a nightmare and it’s not gonna end well for him... Don’t give it to him.
5980,"<|emo_disgust|> Those things are so horrifying. I was inside the second story, I think the floor was open."
5981,<|emo_disgust|> The comments on r/television are what truly sink this sub. They are literally poetry.
5983,<|emo_disgust|> That's not a fucking card?!
5984,<|emo_disgust|> i feel very bothered by this
5985,<|emo_disgust|> In our society we should be appalled at the idea of dating a child. It's just cruel and unusual.
5987,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn I think I speak for most when I say ""fuck both"" when it comes to game spoilage. It’s a shame. "
5988,<|emo_disgust|> It’s called rape now because they didn’t report it to the police.
5990,"<|emo_disgust|> But it's more than that, it's gotten so bad that even the security guard himself has started walking around wearing shorts..."
5991,<|emo_disgust|> There is a difference between hating a person and trying to create a climate of hate.
5993,"<|emo_disgust|> Why is it ""oh god oh fuck oh frick"""
5994,<|emo_disgust|> There. I said it. You’re trying to convince me you’re decent here.
5996,<|emo_disgust|> You're going to hate it eventually. Don't worry but until then it won't hurt you.
5997,<|emo_disgust|> I'll kill you all
5998,"<|emo_disgust|> So....my opinion is [NAME] wants what's best for the team, is she a bad player?"
5999,<|emo_disgust|> So many stupid people think this is a funny meme.
6000,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] that gross
6001,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] what a fucking pimp
6002,"<|emo_disgust|> You're right that the main character is a weirdo with crazy feelings, and she's also the only one to act like an actual friend (the other supporting characters are okay but not by that much)."
6003,<|emo_disgust|> It's hard to pick a favorite. Maybe because I'm too busy feeling envious to pick favorites.
6004,<|emo_disgust|> I have yet to see a respected and sober commenting sub on this. How disgusting!
6005,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] here...that was an awful open shot....
6006,<|emo_disgust|> Thats quite a bit worse tbh
6007,"<|emo_disgust|> It's not always the most disgusting things that makes it creepy, sometimes it's just horrible."
6008,"<|emo_disgust|> My wife, who also works as a bartender, told me I smell like [NAME] and [NAME] during sex. I didn't say anything, didn't complain."
6009,"<|emo_disgust|> The most optimistic and most effective message I've seen is ""vote your conscience or you might get shut down"""
6010,<|emo_disgust|> This is the most useless complain I've ever seen.
6011,<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting. It is not a vote. It is a statement supported by 31% of the vote.
6012,<|emo_disgust|> And it’s not just the media that is wrong here...
6013,<|emo_disgust|> The people there are insane
6014,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking patsy
6016,<|emo_disgust|> He actually did the exact opposite of what he's been saying.
6017,<|emo_disgust|> This is one of the worst I've seen.
6018,<|emo_disgust|> Well I went to one with the intention of making friends - I was awkward as hell after
6019,<|emo_disgust|> She's a liar and a thief.
6020,<|emo_disgust|> Weirdly enough they do. And sometimes they actually talk about it when it’s creepy. But mostly it’s just weird.
6021,"<|emo_disgust|> I have no idea what you are on about, but I'd sure like to hear more. "
6022,"<|emo_disgust|> If it had a fixed base it would never have needed reflagramming. My god, I love defilers."
6023,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, that's fucking PBR"
6024,<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell thought he'd last week
6025,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is here at the ready... goahead!
6027,<|emo_disgust|> I love this thread so much.
6028,<|emo_disgust|> That one shocked me.
6029,<|emo_disgust|> When your girlfriend calls your ex a bimbo you've lost her.
6030,<|emo_disgust|> That’s just.... weird. I’ve never heard of a doctor refering to patients as pets before.
6031,"<|emo_disgust|> Don't listen to much prog or hardcore, I love some black metal though."
6032,<|emo_disgust|> It’s a horrible idea. You go from being a child to being adult in a matter of months. You are pathetic for thinking that.
6034,"<|emo_disgust|> When I say the ""I hate the spread of disease"" joke too much, it gets trite."
6036,"<|emo_disgust|> I just really hate the fact [NAME] was also [NAME], then after they both left he basically just put the blame on [NAME] and [NAME]."
6037,<|emo_disgust|> Nooooooo that's terrible
6038,<|emo_disgust|> Damn. How.
6040,<|emo_disgust|> They’re not. He’s a moron.
6041,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fucking pro. That's just how they say you can't see the face of the devil.
6042,<|emo_disgust|> What a weird way to present a news bulletin.
6043,"<|emo_disgust|> That scene was so cringe-worthy, and yet you don't think it would happen with [NAME]?"
6044,<|emo_disgust|> It really is just a terrible logo for a terrible company
6046,<|emo_disgust|> Man.... This kid is a fucking monster.
6047,<|emo_disgust|> This is actually fucking creepy.
6049,"<|emo_disgust|> I have been a fan of his since the beginning of the season, but [NAME], [NAME].... I just can’t. "
6050,<|emo_disgust|> There's a disturbing amount of fba in Turkey these days.
6051,<|emo_disgust|> They’re looking like [NAME] and [NAME] with a tuck!
6053,<|emo_disgust|> I'm just going to have to put the word racist in question.
6055,"<|emo_disgust|> I love taking my girlfriend to Victorias Secret, we trade stories. She is the best. "
6056,<|emo_disgust|> Don't blame us because you're sitting through the first six minutes of a basketball game and still decide to watch porn.
6057,<|emo_disgust|> I'd rather face death than an uncertain future. I want an uncertain future.
6058,<|emo_disgust|> The carpool thing is a hilarious rip-off.
6059,"<|emo_disgust|> How dare you talk about a dead body parts trade, kid <3"
6060,<|emo_disgust|> This is the first time I've seen [NAME] talk bad about a woman. Not once in a million years will I find him this toxic
6061,<|emo_disgust|> Thats a bollocking response. The point is that its creepy and weird and seems to spring from a weird older men's subreddit with an obsession with creepy men.
6062,<|emo_disgust|> I will gladly pay 10 times what that guy is asking just to say I disagree with him.
6063,"<|emo_disgust|> The more you wind me up the worse it gets for her later on, especially when they get called on their bullshit."
6065,<|emo_disgust|> And it looks f*cking horrific
6068,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, I got you..."
6069,<|emo_disgust|> Why do you have a Reddit account tho?
6070,"<|emo_disgust|> This is a great example of that “I’m in the wrong” bullshit, what a great catch."
6071,<|emo_disgust|> Because we're a bunch of wimpy weak minded n***s who never learned anything from our forefathers even though it pains them deeply to do so
6072,<|emo_disgust|> Because they're dissatisfied with their lives
6073,<|emo_disgust|> He's the one who fucked about with my mom. I'm the one who's screwed over.
6074,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, there's always the risk of a violent revolution."
6075,<|emo_disgust|> I don’t have my heart set on a playoff spot but we all know [NAME] cares more for his fantasy team than his squad. 
6076,<|emo_disgust|> You should go down there.its a horrifically ugly place and its full ofstupid old men who may well be from there.
6077,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Greed, not greed, my friend! And there will be no more!"""
6078,<|emo_disgust|> This is the saddest thing I've read today. I'll link it anyways. Thank you for making internet so shitty.
6079,"<|emo_disgust|> You can't just say the word ""gun"" and expect the response, right?"
6080,<|emo_disgust|> I really hate [NAME]
6083,<|emo_disgust|> This is stupid
6086,<|emo_disgust|> Why are you even here. Fuck off.
6087,<|emo_disgust|> That's so sick.
6089,<|emo_disgust|> Because it's a terrible idea.
6090,<|emo_disgust|> How dare the media give a platform to [NAME] and his disgusting behaviour!
6092,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. Good to know she's in better hands.
6094,<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting. Apt.
6095,<|emo_disgust|> That's so disgusting. VWP
6096,<|emo_disgust|> The problem is that you think that a man's worth is determined by his performance on the court. Stop with the bullshit
6100,<|emo_disgust|> Thats just disgusting. He should be embarrassed.
6101,<|emo_disgust|> Oh god yer awful
6102,"<|emo_disgust|> I was born in 1987 and while I love Playstation 2 & 3, I also loved CrystalDisk Wars. Fuck that show"
6103,"<|emo_disgust|> Because it's a terrible, terrible idea."
6104,"<|emo_disgust|> The only stupid thing I say is ""uhh, well I have a girlfriend"" I like myself enough for the third time in my life."
6105,"<|emo_disgust|> What? [NAME]! I've seen him at the Berto gym, he literally scolds people about their gym and they're totally not terrible."
6106,<|emo_disgust|> Oh man I was so dumb lol
6107,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damnit.
6108,<|emo_disgust|> He has weird hair
6110,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, it's a little creepy. Who does that?"
6111,"<|emo_disgust|> I thought to myself, why would [NAME] want to become a worse [NAME] after he helped you becoming a worse [NAME]!!"
6112,"<|emo_disgust|> My mother used to do this. She would sometimes say, ""I don't like kids but here's a hot dog!"""
6113,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Don't do that, guys. It's dangerous!"""
6114,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I hate Reddit as a whole.
6115,<|emo_disgust|> Oh my gosh! That poor janitor who just tossed away the money from the till (!!!)
6116,<|emo_disgust|> She doesn’t and I don’t know why
6117,<|emo_disgust|> He’s scary
6118,<|emo_disgust|> Not to worry. His replacement will look even worse.
6119,<|emo_disgust|> I am so disgusting that I thought that was a joke...
6120,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck so obvious
6121,<|emo_disgust|> How is this not racist? What a blanket statement.
6123,<|emo_disgust|> >Dmitry's got a long history of strange behavior. Go figure.
6124,"<|emo_disgust|> I think it would be more appropriate to call them ""aggrieved"" rather than ""hurt""."
6125,<|emo_disgust|> What a hate sub
6127,<|emo_disgust|> Oh and y'all still didn't get your fucking point across... So mean
6129,<|emo_disgust|> It is so damn disgusting
6130,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, [NAME] has his reasons for wanting to run, I guess."
6131,<|emo_disgust|> Well damn I want them to play as [NAME] the game is long and I feel so bad for the guy
6132,<|emo_disgust|> The [NAME] of horror!
6133,<|emo_disgust|> You're a disgusting freak
6134,<|emo_disgust|> People who are so angry with everyone and everything around them is the opposite of what most people need - hope instead is a healthy amount of anger.
6135,<|emo_disgust|> That’s disgusting. She’s disgusting. I hate her so much.
6136,<|emo_disgust|> I still like to take my chances in the worst.
6137,<|emo_disgust|> Youre a mean person.
6138,<|emo_disgust|> She looks like [NAME] in Sex and the City
6139,<|emo_disgust|> Damn. I remember the dude getting irrationally angry and callous. It was also during the height of his stardom where he became extremely boring.
6140,<|emo_disgust|> I was so excited when she told the story! Geez that's just so awful.
6141,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was awful for us [NAME]
6142,<|emo_disgust|> She still calls herself a feminist... Stop asking stupid questions to get attention!
6143,<|emo_disgust|> When I was a kid my parents had a field trip to Gladstone Arizona during our visiting weekend. It was quite interesting! Thanks for sharing!
6144,<|emo_disgust|> Weird. Good job on your part. I have some weed issues too but nothing like that.
6145,<|emo_disgust|> That was an incredible goal
6147,"<|emo_disgust|> Because of this, I'm unable to wear contact lenses."
6148,<|emo_disgust|> >the worst game in the world if you're a Sydney based reader. I don’t want to believe that myself so I can enjoy it
6150,"<|emo_disgust|> I always get hard on this post, don't you?"
6151,"<|emo_disgust|> In my opinion, the worst is when a movie star takes a picture of themselves that is worse than a beach pic and then tries to defend it."
6152,<|emo_disgust|> He is so dumb but I love him
6154,<|emo_disgust|> This thread makes it sad I'm a vegan.
6155,<|emo_disgust|> You're a horrible human being and an awful hypocrite.. go take a shower and grow up
6156,<|emo_disgust|> Holy crap I didn't even know that was a thing.
6157,"<|emo_disgust|> Not gonna happen, I mean you get what you deserve, right? Well done. "
6158,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] who?
6159,<|emo_disgust|> i always feel a little offended by that
6160,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch. How did she get past the second layer of security?
6161,"<|emo_disgust|> The new rules mean they are less likely to get loans, which sucks."
6162,<|emo_disgust|> Wow. Never thought I’d see a comrade there
6163,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck all you wanna talk about hoe got a fucking idea bro. He's got the fucking ballin
6164,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch! You're dirty! Now get outta here with that smelly f*cking money!
6165,<|emo_disgust|> i feel that theres nothing wrong if you dont see them as your friends
6166,<|emo_disgust|> I’d rather them than us both
6167,"<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck, seriously."
6168,<|emo_disgust|> The least disgusting person ever to grace reddit...
6169,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] can’t save the world. Damnit dammit
6170,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck that job.
6171,<|emo_disgust|> He got kicked around for months after he was found guilty of embezzling government money...he didn't get punished seriously
6172,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird considering they have apparently had worse air quality in New York than in London.
6175,"<|emo_disgust|> The worst is when we are totally sure we know the answer, and it turns out to be incorrect"
6177,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I’m crying on /r/tworeddit
6178,<|emo_disgust|> He really likes his beer.
6181,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that's a lot of karma!
6182,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking idiot I am.
6183,<|emo_disgust|> I hate the way your brain works OP. Always did enjoy bugs bunny humour.
6184,<|emo_disgust|> Because we all love him on Yelp:-)
6185,"<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting. Those are the only two options. Abortion is still a crime, her death should be the consequence"
6186,<|emo_disgust|> This is pretty disgusting.
6187,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck all the snow in the city. Fuck that.
6190,<|emo_disgust|> Who wants a free roll up in the refuse? It's not like you're trying to turn it's residents against each other.
6191,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] are horrible
6192,<|emo_disgust|> Shut up cowpoke
6194,"<|emo_disgust|> Well the worst is having a child out of wedlock, but I don't have kids.."
6196,<|emo_disgust|> Oh wow I’d never thought of that
6197,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck you and your stupid ass ideas.
6198,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm a little drunk but just barely so, I was scared as shit when I saw it."
6199,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking asshole lol
6201,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] you people are so fucking dumb
6202,<|emo_disgust|> That's a no-no. It's rude and immodest.
6203,<|emo_disgust|> This is one of the worst I've seen. I've seen worse.
6204,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a terrible writer.
6205,"<|emo_disgust|> I get it. I don't hate the game, but I'm a lot older now."
6206,<|emo_disgust|> That is the worst take I have ever heard on cooking ever. Worst ever.
6207,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has a fucking gun oh my god
6208,<|emo_disgust|> Oh that's lovely
6209,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is one of the worst receivers in the league... just ask [NAME].
6210,<|emo_disgust|> What a pathetic position to take
6211,"<|emo_disgust|> How'd he get away with that, no-no-no?"
6213,<|emo_disgust|> That's creepy and weird. Do you mind if I clip this to my wall as a reminder that you're a creep?
6214,<|emo_disgust|> Man I hate this too hah
6216,"<|emo_disgust|> This is awful.. One of the first things I said to him was ""no."""
6217,<|emo_disgust|> You are disgusting and your parents are worse.
6218,"<|emo_disgust|> She might be a horrible person, but honestly I'd take her at her word for now. Probably her worst fear."
6219,<|emo_disgust|> The fuck? Why is he smiling for?
6220,<|emo_disgust|> He can’t protect his wife. She’s gone. He has no other option.
6221,<|emo_disgust|> Oh boy that poor janitor.
6223,<|emo_disgust|> My bad xD
6224,<|emo_disgust|> This is the weirdest thing I've seen on this subreddit today.
6225,<|emo_disgust|> Lol the comments on that thread are what I expected and that's the biggest red flag I've seen for that sub.
6226,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, it's weird as well."
6227,<|emo_disgust|> It's more that I don't think you've met or heard anything about the situation because you seem to be inarticulate from the very start.
6228,<|emo_disgust|> The guy was an absolute monster. I hate him so much and I'm so sorry he went on to do horrible things.
6229,<|emo_disgust|> But so is racism. Isn’t that racist? R1
6230,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not ashamed to wear shorts in public.
6231,<|emo_disgust|> Not exactly the same as racist bigots calling for a ban on 'brown skin'.
6232,<|emo_disgust|> They do not say “good bye” like in a car accident.
6234,<|emo_disgust|> And they are actually all worse than [NAME]
6235,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] fucking [NAME] stop
6236,"<|emo_disgust|> Lol I'd bet she doesn't have any shame since she's a model, that she would be ashamed of what she wore.."
6237,<|emo_disgust|> They are just gonna argue with each other
6238,<|emo_disgust|> Lol I just looked at your history and it says you are from South Asia. Interesting.
6239,<|emo_disgust|> The only one to have actually met [NAME]. He and [NAME] would argue a lot and she would always end up hurt.
6240,<|emo_disgust|> And you wonder why there's no video of [NAME] fighting [NAME].
6241,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds awful. I know [NAME] lives for the night shift and hardly ever has sex but that's just it.
6242,<|emo_disgust|> She's a terrible debater she's terrible at debating
6243,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]...the worst
6244,<|emo_disgust|> I feel like the biggest douche in our circle jerk. I also hated making fun of his name.
6245,<|emo_disgust|> People were upset of him for being associated with the KKK.
6246,<|emo_disgust|> Wow I'm sorry that happened to you. Stay strong!
6247,<|emo_disgust|> I feel so fucking bad for the people who actually saw the movie
6248,<|emo_disgust|> How is this bad?
6249,<|emo_disgust|> I’ve had it with seeing these stupid memes since January.
6250,"<|emo_disgust|> If we start 2018 with a bad starting 15, we’d be in for a horrible summer"
6251,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking see it
6253,"<|emo_disgust|> I think you miss the meaning of the word ""scum""."
6254,<|emo_disgust|> It actually made my skin crawl
6255,<|emo_disgust|> Worst game I've ever seen [NAME] play.
6256,<|emo_disgust|> I think I prefer the dinkyard concept. You could maybe imagine it as a cleaning lady/maid but for the most part it's a janitor
6257,<|emo_disgust|> In other words. You don't deserve your freedom because some random group of people decided they wanted to decide for YOU.
6258,<|emo_disgust|> This is how you get anass
6259,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh no, is that it?"
6260,<|emo_disgust|> This is so disgusting. No one should act like this.
6261,<|emo_disgust|> Lol they just do
6262,"<|emo_disgust|> Omg, I knew a girl who went from zero to almost 20 in under 2 months! "
6264,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not the only person who has seen that. The dude in the GIF looks like his veins are on fire.
6266,<|emo_disgust|> It's very weird.
6267,<|emo_disgust|> It's so infuriating to be so dependent on government programs.
6268,<|emo_disgust|> What a worthless list
6269,<|emo_disgust|> The only ones affected are the teachers and the cops that are supposed to protect the public.
6270,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that we're making an appearance is a pretty big thing for this sub right now.
6271,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck you.
6272,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, there's more. He had a history of making sexist and racist statements."
6273,<|emo_disgust|> It is a highly underappreciated movie. It shows just how bad some of today's society are at being terrible adults.
6274,<|emo_disgust|> i feel very ungrateful for my family life the way i have it and i think it comes down to having no worthwhile life and feeling like life is so dull and predictable
6275,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has a prog rock album because he fucking loves it
6277,<|emo_disgust|> It's like the equivalent of saying [NAME] sucks while giving a FUCK about the OkC game?
6279,<|emo_disgust|> I have never seen a more triumphant deadpan line.
6280,<|emo_disgust|> The only other character who has been in Persona 5 is [NAME] in a very similar form.
6281,<|emo_disgust|> I don't like sleeping in the couch :(
6282,<|emo_disgust|> I guess I hate it when people downvote me just because I said something.
6283,<|emo_disgust|> It’s [NAME] I hate.
6285,<|emo_disgust|> I hate it.
6286,"<|emo_disgust|> That'd be a lot better ""fuck the state"""
6287,<|emo_disgust|> He’s a scumbag.. How dare you.
6289,<|emo_disgust|> Damn man I really care about this.
6290,<|emo_disgust|> That shit really just made my skin crawl
6294,<|emo_disgust|> The “News” paper is a absolute shill for [NAME] and his cronies. It’s disgusting.
6295,<|emo_disgust|> I have no idea what that even means. Who’s an actual [RELIGION] now?
6296,<|emo_disgust|> She is a child. Absolutely call an ambulance right now unless you're about to faint from shock.
6297,<|emo_disgust|> It was awful; I loved watching it.
6298,"<|emo_disgust|> She has already lost, and it may never be recoverable."
6299,<|emo_disgust|> So fucking callous!!!
6300,<|emo_disgust|> This is not a smart economic strategy.
6301,<|emo_disgust|> Wow so cringe
6303,"<|emo_disgust|> If people have those desires, I don't see how they could ever be fulfilled. "
6304,"<|emo_disgust|> The way I see it, the best defense is a good offense. That's why I think ""hockey pun"" should be illegal."
6305,<|emo_disgust|> i am now feeling really agitated and stressed
6306,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like a bitchy whore
6307,<|emo_disgust|> If this is true it makes me wonder how he knew that
6308,<|emo_disgust|> Don't tell anyone that. Just out of curiosity.
6309,<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting.
6310,<|emo_disgust|> >[NAME]. The secondhand panic and embarrassment 
6311,"<|emo_disgust|> Well that sucks, but at least now you will know parents are lying. /s"
6313,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn just look at that shit right there. Take it easy, comrade!"
6314,<|emo_disgust|> How is this bad tbh. All this is great news for us customers though.
6315,<|emo_disgust|> If I’m doing wronged I’ll callrecovery.
6316,<|emo_disgust|> You cant't have the full compliment unless you drink piss.
6318,<|emo_disgust|> I feel bad for the kids because their parents wouldnt let them put a big sign outside of their church that read “BEFORE YOUR GOD”
6319,"<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing is saying the same thing 10, 20, 30 years later..."
6320,"<|emo_disgust|> Just because you're uncomfortable with uncomfortable and disgusting, it doesn't mean everyone else is."
6321,<|emo_disgust|> Wow this is a really bad list
6323,<|emo_disgust|> I think I'm in love
6326,<|emo_disgust|> Damn this sucks. So glad you’re okay. Stay strong!
6328,<|emo_disgust|> Don't tell me what to do.
6329,<|emo_disgust|> Damn what a journey.
6330,<|emo_disgust|> But why? It’s too damn expensive to heat the country..
6331,"<|emo_disgust|> What a weird and slightly racist thing to say, especially given that your parents were Inuit."
6332,"<|emo_disgust|> I feel you. I've had serious depression, anxiety, and was even considering suicide by eating PrEP. It's all gotten so bad that i've just given up."
6333,"<|emo_disgust|> Who doesn't have something that was once valued $100 or more, no matter where they live?"
6336,<|emo_disgust|> The more you wind me up the worse it gets for you later
6337,<|emo_disgust|> Your creepy creepy pictures with her...
6338,<|emo_disgust|> The sad part of this is that the more guns we have the more violent people we're gonna have. This is not a peaceful solution. Stop blaming the wrong people First
6339,<|emo_disgust|> In a worst case scenario he could die of diarrhea
6340,"<|emo_disgust|> It literally makes no sense that my high school guidance was all about hating the word ""lezgul."""
6341,"<|emo_disgust|> Just because he speaks out about horrible things, doesn’t mean he isn’t awful person."
6343,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a disgusting insecure manchild.
6344,"<|emo_disgust|> It is weird that her ""ex boyfriend"" is also [NAME] dad, then her parents tried to fight him while [NAME] are both parents to her!"
6345,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn that’s a burden, I think I’m going back to beer some time soon."
6346,<|emo_disgust|> I've had these feelings before and haven't expressed them. It's awkward.
6347,"<|emo_disgust|> Your dad has some weird tastes, I would agree."
6348,<|emo_disgust|> She really is a horrible person..
6349,<|emo_disgust|> I want to lose more.
6353,<|emo_disgust|> No. We don't care. Fuck off.
6354,"<|emo_disgust|> But you’re saying it would make rape so awful that it would make women afraid to have sex with them, huh?"
6355,<|emo_disgust|> That was a brutal 1 on 1 with him
6357,"<|emo_disgust|> Fuck that, I wanted to play the mode"
6358,<|emo_disgust|> This is the kind of crap that gets posted on this sub (and not getting downvoted) I hate it.
6359,<|emo_disgust|> Your wife is a piece of shit...or worse
6360,<|emo_disgust|> The fake news media is literally the enemy of the people. Their only goal is to make money. It’s disgusting!
6361,<|emo_disgust|> >This just reminded me I've been a good apple
6362,"<|emo_disgust|> And if people complain that we have an inflated team wage bill, well, it's probably because of those players being paid far less than their peers."
6363,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah it’s kinda awkward to be walking by someone in a suit without saying anything.
6364,"<|emo_disgust|> I get these all the time, I keep them in my car or hide them under my furniture. Also, I hate to keep them around in my crawl space. "
6365,<|emo_disgust|> She's a monster.
6366,<|emo_disgust|> You're disgusting and should be ashamed for your disgustingness.
6367,"<|emo_disgust|> What a bummer, but I’m not a [NAME] [NAME] or [NAME]. These are horrible people. "
6368,"<|emo_disgust|> You're looking at the wrong sub, I'm sorry it's so shitty."
6369,<|emo_disgust|> Because she's the one who humiliated you. /s
6370,<|emo_disgust|> How the hell does this sub get their shit together.
6371,<|emo_disgust|> Why the fuck do I feel sympathetic towards her?
6372,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] the most obnoxious and obnoxious human being to have walked the face of the planet.
6374,<|emo_disgust|> My favorite gusgasm
6375,<|emo_disgust|> >[NAME] I hate these
6376,<|emo_disgust|> There will never be a day when I do not love and fear the same thing.
6377,<|emo_disgust|> What the fuckkkkk are you on about again?
6378,<|emo_disgust|> Weirdly enough his jersey numbers are ‘38’ and ‘45’
6379,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] i hate Twitter
6381,"<|emo_disgust|> No, it's not ""haha, you suck"" but rather ""I'm so angry and realize that I've done bad things"" "
6383,<|emo_disgust|> Now I have [NAME] in my head for the entire 50 min!!! He is one of the best!
6385,<|emo_disgust|> That's really disgusting. Is there any way we can pressure the company further?
6386,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] I meant [NAME].
6387,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] that poor sap
6388,<|emo_disgust|> I would prefer death to this
6389,<|emo_disgust|> You are absolutely correct. It's farcical that we continue to allow some psychopaths to exist without being called on for their behavior.
6390,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I never would have guessed the writers liked him that much.
6392,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh noooo. I can't imagine. What goes through his head? I mean, he's a grown man. I can just imagine."
6393,<|emo_disgust|> That woman should be sent to a mental institution.
6394,<|emo_disgust|> This is a disgusting post
6395,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh no, I forgot about the ""inaccurate"" version."
6396,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm with you, pulju has been looking dangerous lately"
6397,<|emo_disgust|> They are just bad at what they say they do
6398,<|emo_disgust|> Damn i’d heard that in St Louis and that made me feel even worse.
6399,<|emo_disgust|> She should not have run for president in the first place! Your party has lost!
6400,<|emo_disgust|> Damn. I wish I could give these guys a hug. But I can't. 🤢
6401,<|emo_disgust|> The only decent reply was [NAME] and [NAME] are assholes.
6402,"<|emo_disgust|> But the big question, why would she have left [NAME]? She could have convinced her own wife that the guy was really worthless."
6403,"<|emo_disgust|> He's a mean, ugly, disgusting human being"
6406,"<|emo_disgust|> I have a gut feeling that this is a big one, because [NAME] is so consistently bad"
6408,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't know any, my wife and I have been together 5 years. We still argue. "
6409,<|emo_disgust|> Just think of the children!
6410,<|emo_disgust|> Wow.... I’m so sorry for your loss
6412,"<|emo_disgust|> That's more like a yes-no. ""Require condomlessness for all married couples"" sounds awful to me."
6413,<|emo_disgust|> I'd throw a fit if a milk carton was upside down on the floor
6414,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] noooo!
6415,<|emo_disgust|> If the message is getting through I'm dissatisfied.
6416,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm a guy, too. I've never had a single girl in my life! "
6417,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating that it's just not funny.
6418,<|emo_disgust|> I would've kicked a tiresome old man out of a jail if he'd let a dog run around with his cats
6421,<|emo_disgust|> There was a creepy old man in the area who assured him he wasn’t from anywhere particularly important. I don’t know where to begin to describe his character.
6422,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was so right. It's just sad how many terrible writers get ignored in podcasts.
6424,<|emo_disgust|> The amount of hate [NAME] gets is insane. It’s not like he’s anything Except a drunk.
6425,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is terrible... how awful.
6426,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, it's kind of like ""what if [NAME] wasn't a fake?"""
6427,<|emo_disgust|> That poor wench
6429,<|emo_disgust|> Not gonna lie. This is my favorite wild memory.
6430,<|emo_disgust|> She’s actually a horrible person. I’d drop she’s Literally any of the above.
6431,<|emo_disgust|> People need to stop using words like that to describes themselves
6432,<|emo_disgust|> That's weird. He's never said that.
6433,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] looks bad
6436,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking [NAME] is having an unbelievable season this year.....
6437,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] fucking does this mean its ok to slut shame people for being intelligent, creative, and self-assured?"
6439,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is the worst Of any sports team Unis!!!
6440,<|emo_disgust|> This is the saddest thing I've seen today. The way he held the news at the end was so terrible.
6442,<|emo_disgust|> Those are the only two words that begin with ‘motherfukers’ which is odd
6443,<|emo_disgust|> You are a horrible human being.
6444,<|emo_disgust|> My son told me he hates me
6445,"<|emo_disgust|> No, they don’t. This is how people get away with things."
6447,"<|emo_disgust|> My god, this is so painful"
6448,<|emo_disgust|> Just to provide context to your ridiculous comparison
6449,"<|emo_disgust|> The only thing worse than this is if it's a good thing. Like, you see, with this kind of law passed, violent offenders will start resenting violent offenders."
6450,"<|emo_disgust|> I thought it was funny that he'd changed his username to ""Poopey"" after the debacle with Incels."
6451,<|emo_disgust|> That's a terrible amount of bp for just a generic dk. Not saying I don't support her but what a crazy deal
6452,<|emo_disgust|> What a bummer it was over a decade ago now
6453,<|emo_disgust|> I got my hopes up when it was announce that [NAME] was coming back as the ringleader because I was really high on the cancelled One Piece movies. I hope it works out for him.
6454,"<|emo_disgust|> This is so horrifying but also so very good. Thank you!!! We need to ""clean"" vaccinated kids and that makes me so angry, even more than this. "
6455,"<|emo_disgust|> So sorry you are suffering, spiritually and physically. May we all come together and heal?"
6456,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't actually think he was a fascist, he just (apparently) didn't like the idea of a government run economy."
6457,<|emo_disgust|> Damn. I want my fucking cake back.
6458,<|emo_disgust|> The real reason you're an asshole is that you care about your appearance more than your health.
6459,"<|emo_disgust|> The way I wrote that made me think he was going to give me a weird vibe. He's very confident with his answers to this sub, so I was really wrong "
6460,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck it...
6461,<|emo_disgust|> Your company sucks?
6463,<|emo_disgust|> i know i can relate but i cant say for sure if or not because i feel kinda stupid
6464,<|emo_disgust|> People hate him.
6466,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like im so cold even the air comes in with the cold wave
6468,<|emo_disgust|> And that head is still hanging around despite being badly shaken. This is just cruel.
6469,"<|emo_disgust|> >I don't really have an answer for you, but I do have a couple things to say on behalf of the general population. Love to be insulted but don't want to be insulted."
6470,<|emo_disgust|> Now I'm wondering why the fuck the damn loudspeaker heard his wedding ring instead of fucking congratulations!
6471,<|emo_disgust|> I didn't like it at all but I'm not intogg like a month ago lol
6472,<|emo_disgust|> So now the City Manager's Office is in league with the Insurance Brokers. How do you look [NAME] in the eye? How do you get this guy? 
6473,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling very petty right now
6474,<|emo_disgust|> I have a serious case of irritable bowel syndrome and I'm still not in the mood to get on an actual date.
6475,<|emo_disgust|> So the main thing I'll bring up is how I don't want him using his new power to rape and beat women. Stop making him a monster 
6476,<|emo_disgust|> This is just the worst I've seen
6477,<|emo_disgust|> It’s called “screen door”. Can’t imagine having a heart murmur while being walked through a door. Sad.
6478,<|emo_disgust|> The fuck? I just got here and noticed this tbh.
6480,<|emo_disgust|> Whoops. I don't know anything about politics except how much I hate [NAME].
6482,<|emo_disgust|> Not surprised because we're an embarrassment to both the Steelers family and the state of Kentucky
6483,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn what a comeback. I didn't think it was possible until it started.
6484,<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck are you talking about.
6485,<|emo_disgust|> Your dog is being bullied. Take a stand and get a collar. You might be one of those kids! That bully needs to be reported to animal control.
6486,<|emo_disgust|> You don't like the cold? Or maybe you're just all warm and bothered by the cold?
6487,<|emo_disgust|> That's a nasty bruise under his eye!
6489,<|emo_disgust|> I can see his daughter doing this I can’t even imagine. She’s a horrible person but she can’t even do shit that’s even remotely compared to what she did
6490,<|emo_disgust|> A FUCKTON OF THEM. WHY DARE YOU.
6491,<|emo_disgust|> People think you're weird for posting that.
6492,"<|emo_disgust|> No, what’s happened is [NAME] got caught making a child porno, and now he’s been banned from all Reddit. The same person who thinks Reddit pedophiles need to be arrested. "
6494,<|emo_disgust|> i feel more of a hatred towards them because of my fear for how they might become a burden to me
6495,<|emo_disgust|> Wow this is horrible. is a horrible thing to say.
6497,<|emo_disgust|> Wow the way he's breathing that's so odd.
6498,<|emo_disgust|> But I'm mad at the people who made it for your little thread lol
6499,<|emo_disgust|> So much wasted motion.
6500,"<|emo_disgust|> You're one ugly, ugly ugly woman."
6501,"<|emo_disgust|> The other day, my mother told me something entirely opposite to what I said. It broke my heart. "
6502,<|emo_disgust|> i feel all tortured by what happened on julianne
6503,"<|emo_disgust|> In that case, it's even worse."
6506,<|emo_disgust|> Fuuuuuuuuuck. I'm so sorry. Are you being punished for saying those things?
6508,<|emo_disgust|> Oh my [NAME] please no
6510,<|emo_disgust|> Shut up?
6512,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] just can’t get it together
6513,<|emo_disgust|> The whole thing is Absolutely stunning
6514,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, [NAME] is on fire!!!"
6515,"<|emo_disgust|> The carpool part killed me. The stop sign part wasn’t that bad, though. "
6516,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, I hate when people describe an attraction as a choice... that's a pretty vague description. "
6517,"<|emo_disgust|> The last article was really stupid and bad, and all I can say is that [NAME] sucks because he was writing on a Saturday morning. "
6518,<|emo_disgust|> i need this to be a truthful reflection of my feelings for it will only serve to irritate me
6519,<|emo_disgust|> Now let me add to all that - this scene was extremely unsatisfying to watch.
6520,<|emo_disgust|> The only acceptable reply. Not a fucking order.
6521,<|emo_disgust|> I don’t know who [NAME] is but I hate him.
6522,<|emo_disgust|> No comment from me on that one
6524,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds awful. I'm sorry. Cheers.
6525,<|emo_disgust|> That was the worst possible outcome
6526,<|emo_disgust|> And [NAME] just went for it too....lol
6528,"<|emo_disgust|> It's actually creepy, honestly."
6529,<|emo_disgust|> She has a weird face
6530,<|emo_disgust|> I hate this.
6531,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, [NAME] was absolutely garbage tonight. "
6532,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is having to pay $300+ for goods that are actually worthless
6533,<|emo_disgust|> What a sickeningly selfish goal. Foul-mouthed selfish poser.
6534,<|emo_disgust|> The reason this is a lot of hits is because most workers have a very simple set of expectations when it comes to tips. Those expectations are incredibly cringy.
6535,<|emo_disgust|> I think this is the first time Ive ever Been this mad ata a fly
6536,<|emo_disgust|> Because the people who suffer from delusions are just a few unfortunate enough to be born with them.
6537,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck no. I am not a hypocrite for wanting to see an end to all animal suffering...
6538,"<|emo_disgust|> My condolences. Love the work, but this is just damn frustrating."
6540,<|emo_disgust|> But even then I don't think it's a terrible pool but I'm still pretty new to the scene.
6541,"<|emo_disgust|> They do. But that's my point, they're disgusting and disgusting people."
6542,<|emo_disgust|> i feel quite irritable and frustrated with my life right now
6543,"<|emo_disgust|> This is scary. Keep safe! Love from throughout the ages, RIP."
6544,<|emo_disgust|> I don’t care if it was during the 2016 election cycle and I’m still not used to it or not caring.
6545,"<|emo_disgust|> Man I tell you, I’ve seen a lot worse. I hope you make it through this. Stay strong"
6546,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a horrible defender but man oh man can you spot the damn butterfly
6548,<|emo_disgust|> A lot of people don’t believe in [RELIGION] so there is a lot of hypocrisy going on there.
6549,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is the most useless phantom thief build I've seen
6550,<|emo_disgust|> Oh god what the hell
6551,"<|emo_disgust|> It's weird, sometimes I post pics of our favorite foods and I'm like omg, damn, I can't be the only one"
6552,<|emo_disgust|> The worst: Having your bed inspected by a licensed health professional
6553,<|emo_disgust|> No he didn't. I was worried that the back was gonna pop out like a sunrocke
6554,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was horrible for us
6555,<|emo_disgust|> No. Your a horrible human being.
6557,<|emo_disgust|> Man I hate Twitter
6559,"<|emo_disgust|> > How dare you comment on a meme, boy am I fucking hungry now. Me either downvote, or do I have bad internet."
6561,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is just another tool in the government's arsenal to harass and harass and harass. Stop using him, you cowards."
6566,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry, what?"
6567,<|emo_disgust|> Oh good lord that was bad
6568,<|emo_disgust|> i just found out that my friend is also broke and has tried so many things in her life to be like ian and she has the most stubborn attitude and she just says no.
6569,<|emo_disgust|> Oh yeah that
6570,"<|emo_disgust|> People have no shame. Shame is the absence of shame, or at the very least the denial of shame. "
6571,<|emo_disgust|> The main reason this game is still struggling is probably [NAME].
6572,"<|emo_disgust|> Because people have the mindset, ""boys can't do wrong, therefore all girls can't do wrong"" "
6573,<|emo_disgust|> I want to end myself when [NAME] does
6574,<|emo_disgust|> The first comment is so awful.
6575,<|emo_disgust|> How many tries has it taken to get this? I'm so exhausted 😺
6576,<|emo_disgust|> It also seems extremely racist.
6577,"<|emo_disgust|> No,no, it’s all good friend."
6578,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck those guys
6579,<|emo_disgust|> Now you've said it yourself. That isn't a good thing to see.
6580,<|emo_disgust|> I'm so fucking jealous.
6581,"<|emo_disgust|> I mean I liked her until the ""I hope he doesn’t fuck your mom so I can’t fuck my dad so I’m not a problem"" part"
6583,<|emo_disgust|> i was feeling quite annoyed when i discovered i could now choose where and how i wanted things to be
6584,<|emo_disgust|> It's been around since around 2005. It's weird and wonderful.
6585,<|emo_disgust|> I'm kinda worried about this.
6587,<|emo_disgust|> People going on about their worst fear is pretty odd.
6588,<|emo_disgust|> I’m going to have to go with the second option here. It’s too damn creepy.
6589,"<|emo_disgust|> No offense, but your parents are assholes."
6590,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I miss AG
6591,<|emo_disgust|> I've seen that a lot. Where's the photo of the driver? (?)
6594,<|emo_disgust|> If you had the same opinion I'd back you up. I'd want to have the conversations first though.
6596,<|emo_disgust|> That’s awful. He’s devastated. I’m sending you thoughts and prayers. 
6597,"<|emo_disgust|> They can get pregnant in the back country, I am sure. It just makes sense."
6598,"<|emo_disgust|> I feel pretty bad for the guy, but man, what a situation."
6600,<|emo_disgust|> But everyone hates [NAME] and [NAME] in this world!
6601,<|emo_disgust|> The fuck downvoted
6603,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, not content with just stealing information from media that should be more concerned with making money."
6604,"<|emo_disgust|> The worst was actually the video that followed it. When [NAME] starts freaking out, he looks like he thinks the kid is a hamster."
6605,<|emo_disgust|> People are an awful lot worse than I thought.
6606,<|emo_disgust|> You're in a bubble then. I just have bad judgment sometimes. But the things you're saying are awful. Sad.
6607,<|emo_disgust|> This is a very well intentioned post. I'm glad you made your own choices.
6608,<|emo_disgust|> Well it looks like they got it wrong lol
6609,"<|emo_disgust|> I swear if this thread is anywhere above average in quality, it’s probably because the likes of this aren’t real fans of the Edmonton sports teams."
6610,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is waiting for the best
6611,<|emo_disgust|> This is just the worstest thing I've ever seen. The bad part is [NAME] is making it worse.
6612,<|emo_disgust|> He just needs to kiss [NAME].
6613,<|emo_disgust|> She is a murderer. Stop being such a-holes.
6614,<|emo_disgust|> That was an ugly 4v3
6615,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so selfish saying it but i did what i had to do
6616,<|emo_disgust|> The guy who does it is a disgusting piece of shit. Do you think he’s good at his job? Maybe he really is.
6617,"<|emo_disgust|> So, as you can see, [NAME] was very vague with his answer."
6619,<|emo_disgust|> Man being attractive is so subjective it’s actually quite terrifying.
6620,<|emo_disgust|> Why is everyone's favorite fatass posting a status update about how she's lost weight she's just been dieting her whole life.
6621,<|emo_disgust|> And by the way I don't even give a shit about karma... Fuck off
6622,<|emo_disgust|> What a crazy person she is
6623,<|emo_disgust|> That's not a fucking card?
6624,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh man I thought he was a [NAME] fan, not a [NAME] fan"
6625,<|emo_disgust|> Weird game lol
6626,"<|emo_disgust|> No more of that ""it's more your choice"" bullshit. We need to stop being the ""you can do what you want"" crowd and instead embrace the positive, compassionate, hands on parenting approach we've been hearing for a long time. "
6627,"<|emo_disgust|> I did so too. He’s just so...fucking obnoxious, his voice is kinda creepy"
6629,"<|emo_disgust|> How dare you ask a question straight from the pages of [NAME]. You ask a question straight from the minds of [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME]!"
6630,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]. That's awful. I am so sorry you were victimized by that.
6631,<|emo_disgust|> That would be sexual assault.
6632,<|emo_disgust|> i feel that it would be wrong if i did not leave this message
6633,<|emo_disgust|> Who fucking cares
6634,<|emo_disgust|> This is a disgusting tip. Please makeamore you disgusting creatures and send them all their snacks
6635,"<|emo_disgust|> We're all just animals, pal."
6636,<|emo_disgust|> Man I'm jealous.
6637,<|emo_disgust|> If a man comes off as creepy I'm less likely to want to talk to him.
6638,<|emo_disgust|> If she didn't want him to play for the team which one of these three do you think is cheating? Didn't want him playing with [NAME]!
6639,<|emo_disgust|> He’s horrible
6641,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] this is awful.
6642,<|emo_disgust|> That was a horrible call
6643,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is so disgusting
6646,"<|emo_disgust|> I mean he did get 1.5 per cent against Sydney last week but as I said against Melbourne we're talking about a really, really low shooting percentage."
6647,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is worstassassassassa anybodys ever could ntag anyone
6648,<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck did I just read
6651,<|emo_disgust|> Your character's so dumb
6653,<|emo_disgust|> That's so disgusting. Those kinds of TBM relationships are incredibly healthy and healthy people are more likely to lose fat. Stop with the BPD bullshit.
6654,<|emo_disgust|> Because we all hate them...
6655,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] and [NAME] looked rough as well.
6656,"<|emo_disgust|> Fuck [NAME] for continuing to host these shows despite years and years of being blatant about his disgusting, unhealthy lifestyle."
6657,"<|emo_disgust|> Now read she wanted to be ""traditionally"" straight to left. Looks pretty odd."
6658,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not saying she didn't tell you she wasn't fine. I'm saying that if it was up to you then you should have let you go.
6659,<|emo_disgust|> The real villains are a mixture of government workers and big corporations that make our jobs insecure and pay so little that it's ridiculous.
6661,"<|emo_disgust|> It's like if there was a ""biohacker"" show on Fox that used real people to guest star. I'm shocked they lasted that long."
6662,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] who said they hated me??? That is an absurd thing to say to a 15 year old
6663,<|emo_disgust|> Oh absolutely! It’s the worst feeling ever
6664,<|emo_disgust|> And this is why I call myself a [NAME]
6666,"<|emo_disgust|> Aah damn it, I didn't know that [NAME] is in fact [NAME] 😂"
6667,<|emo_disgust|> I was angry at the phone calls people were making to their neighbors about my loud music.
6669,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah a drunk girl getting into a car and smashing into people is pretty much par for the course for these areas.
6670,<|emo_disgust|> You are a horrible person.
6671,<|emo_disgust|> Omg this is too good.
6673,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh look, it's an adult!"
6674,<|emo_disgust|> It's honestly pretty disgusting.
6675,<|emo_disgust|> You've got your fucking problems...
6676,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck yeah.
6677,<|emo_disgust|> How do you say the n-word? It’s one of the most loaded words in the English language.
6678,"<|emo_disgust|> I actually got flayed by a dog in real life, it was so vicious I think I unintentionally bit the dog's lip for a good 5 seconds. It was all so teeth!"
6680,"<|emo_disgust|> Well this may be true, but it does look awful considering most of the food on offer comes from Turkey factories."
6681,"<|emo_disgust|> I just hate the ""I don't know"" people"
6682,<|emo_disgust|> >it is a lie and it will always be a lie Because logic tells you lie 
6684,<|emo_disgust|> He's got a fucking gun.
6685,<|emo_disgust|> i didnt feel a cold coming on
6686,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch!!! And I've never had a single one of them spit in my face
6689,<|emo_disgust|> This is a favorite of mine.
6690,"<|emo_disgust|> Who fucking cares. If you don’t want to swear it down it’s ok, just don’t fucking swear it down. Fuck ‘em."
6691,<|emo_disgust|> This comment is getting way too popular. Stop posting them. They just make me angry.
6693,<|emo_disgust|> He’s a horrible player.
6694,<|emo_disgust|> She's definitely a weirdo.
6695,<|emo_disgust|> When will a man call his wife a whore...
6696,<|emo_disgust|> That’s a great way to accidentally kill 10 people
6697,<|emo_disgust|> It's so disgusting that we continue to allow this. #usleepover
6698,<|emo_disgust|> i actually feel very insulted and disgusted by the way the government is run
6699,<|emo_disgust|> How dare [NAME] mention [NAME] during a pre-tournament game! Who the hell knows about [NAME]!
6700,<|emo_disgust|> I'm disgusted that you would malign a 2D printed JV riding a Goddamn raptor
6701,<|emo_disgust|> The last message was particularly painful to read.
6702,<|emo_disgust|> Damn straight! I need to get one!
6703,"<|emo_disgust|> It actually sounds weirdly fake, like something out of a video game. "
6704,<|emo_disgust|> What is scary? A machete? A sword? A gun? A machete in a machete? A sword in a machete? Not a sword in a machete! Not a sword in a machete!
6705,<|emo_disgust|> i thought it was a bit creepy that you had to put a big wordmark on top of the page to prove you were a virgin
6706,<|emo_disgust|> The only positive thing that can possibly come from this is getting the nukes off Nuked countries
6707,"<|emo_disgust|> The top comment is worse, ""Dude"""
6708,<|emo_disgust|> You're a terrible person for being so.
6709,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, what a fucking weird and awkward thing to say."
6710,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating to me.
6711,"<|emo_disgust|> When the man had the heart attack, he had a knife with him. And two small children with him."
6712,<|emo_disgust|> She's just a kid.
6713,<|emo_disgust|> Oh it isn't just me...
6714,<|emo_disgust|> Don't say we didn't warn you!
6718,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, how'd the refs not recognize that? I felt like 2 fullatures ago. My confidence is eroding as f"
6719,<|emo_disgust|> He's got like a MOTHERFUCKER face
6720,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing is his brother. He sounds like he’s taking something deep down with him... That’s the only way to get it out from under your feet
6721,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a horrible writer.
6723,<|emo_disgust|> So much fake news. Broke and jealous.
6724,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not convinced [NAME] fits in anywhere.
6725,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, [NAME] just killed himself I can’t believe it"
6726,<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting. Those women are the worst.
6727,<|emo_disgust|> In that situation I would not have thrown my beer away
6728,"<|emo_disgust|> ""We should kill everyone that dares speak out for [NAME]!"""
6729,"<|emo_disgust|> And I've got to say, the reason I'm writing this post isn't because I'm upset, but because I don't fucking care, I'll continue to play through this game and enjoy my time if I see no progress towards killing theobe"
6730,"<|emo_disgust|> A little girl is about to get her ass handed to her by a man, probably a cop or a bouncer."
6731,<|emo_disgust|> That is so fucking creepy. Good riddance to awful rubbish.
6732,"<|emo_disgust|> The man was eating away at a tree limb, probably like aARD."
6734,<|emo_disgust|> > I'm literally screaming.
6737,"<|emo_disgust|> You are an awful human being, you should be ashamed of yourself."
6738,"<|emo_disgust|> I have no idea what [NAME] is, but I hate reading these generic posts."
6739,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like i should look a little dazed and wonder why its so freaking hot
6740,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is worse though because he never finished with a goals per game average...
6741,<|emo_disgust|> Who gave you the order? I would have given myself two whacks.
6743,<|emo_disgust|> No surprise there. Abortion is extremely difficult for poor people.
6744,"<|emo_disgust|> Don’t worry, mom! We’ll be fine."
6745,<|emo_disgust|> This thread is a good indicator of where the culture has gone. Horrific.
6746,<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting. The secondhand panic and embarrassment I feel is surprising.
6748,<|emo_disgust|> I was wondering what he’s on for’ Christmas’
6749,<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell thought he had a beard!
6751,<|emo_disgust|> I've watched too many reality shows to take them seriously.
6752,<|emo_disgust|> This person should be outed to the world. I feel like this is the most reckless thing I've seen on this sub yet
6753,<|emo_disgust|> You're an ugly little shit
6754,"<|emo_disgust|> This is awful, and the only thing that's coming out of her mouth is anger. Not a good start. "
6755,<|emo_disgust|> i had to take it and walk away without putting much stock in it except to say im still feeling a little pissed off
6756,"<|emo_disgust|> That’s a weird number, 0-9."
6758,"<|emo_disgust|> The only thing worse than this guy was if this story were told by a sympathetic, everyday person."
6759,<|emo_disgust|> She did worse than murder. kidnapped her. raped her. stole from her. done to her.
6760,<|emo_disgust|> What the hell!?
6761,<|emo_disgust|> You took it way too far.
6762,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I can’t have nice things.
6763,<|emo_disgust|> There are some weird things about being born that way.
6764,<|emo_disgust|> It's too damn creepy
6765,"<|emo_disgust|> When the [NAME] does it, well I dont think it is illegal, but it would definitely piss a lot of people off."
6766,<|emo_disgust|> This is the single worst thing I've seen on Reddit in a while.
6767,<|emo_disgust|> Because people like him are ruining Germany
6769,<|emo_disgust|> i feel just as mad about that now as when i was a kid
6770,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck why you keep trying to suck my balls?
6771,<|emo_disgust|> Why are you so angry...
6772,<|emo_disgust|> Because they fear for their lives...
6773,<|emo_disgust|> You realize it's bullshit right?
6774,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm glad as hell you're not his wife, that sounds awful."
6775,<|emo_disgust|> I miss the west coast. This is the perfect example why the NHL needs to get in Canada's face more
6776,<|emo_disgust|> She’s the worst :(
6777,<|emo_disgust|> Lol you're disgusting
6778,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn I just wanted to be a mom, this is just awful."
6779,<|emo_disgust|> i feel that ive been guilty of such things only to look on in disgust
6781,"<|emo_disgust|> There's probably a lot of lies and bullshit in this thread. Worst of all is the ""I don't want to get fired because of this"" bullshit."
6783,"<|emo_disgust|> You know, the guy that makes fun of the color blue for being associated with communism?"
6784,<|emo_disgust|> And I thought [NAME] was the scariest psychopath...
6786,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] fucked all the kids in the school..
6787,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I love me some winter depression
6789,<|emo_disgust|> What a disgusting post omg
6790,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah he's probably been guilty of plenty of other illegal activities.
6792,"<|emo_disgust|> Soooo he is in fact a ""fucking"" [NAME] lol"
6793,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is saying something on the internet that could get you killed.
6794,"<|emo_disgust|> He was a guest co-writer on the show. In that capacity, you are unfortunately spot on."
6795,<|emo_disgust|> They say politics is the arena of the ugly....
6797,<|emo_disgust|> They didn’t even take into account the fact that he’s a college student and not a retired cop
6798,<|emo_disgust|> I always thought they were a bit weirdly British.
6802,<|emo_disgust|> This is weird
6803,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I haven't been eating shit since I got out of the military, so that probably helped. "
6805,<|emo_disgust|> She's also responsible for passing laws which allow for the collection of personal information through the use of Predator-style drones and now the US is fighting back with drones!
6807,"<|emo_disgust|> I don’t think they are. My bet is they do but as a remainer, it’s infuriating. "
6808,<|emo_disgust|> Weird way to spell Disenchanted
6809,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fucking talwpie.
6810,<|emo_disgust|> Just horrible.
6811,<|emo_disgust|> Those ears...those ears...that's what I heard
6812,<|emo_disgust|> You should call them ugly cunts
6813,<|emo_disgust|> What the hell kind of school does this?
6814,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is pretty damn amazing sometimes tbh
6815,"<|emo_disgust|> Not to be critical but a lot of people call themselves ""feminist"" and some call themselves ""progressive"" and some call themselves a mix of the two."
6816,<|emo_disgust|> I'm really not sure what to say... this thread is pretty interesting
6817,"<|emo_disgust|> He reminds me of the guy who was recently arrested on suspicion of selling fake used cars, I thought that was terrible"
6819,<|emo_disgust|> That was a horrible open shot....
6820,"<|emo_disgust|> If something is truly awful, it’s worse than being a worse version of yourself."
6821,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, it’s sad they think that."
6824,"<|emo_disgust|> This is really disgusting, I can't imagine there wouldn't be a mass boycott happening if this had been the case."
6826,<|emo_disgust|> I’m very sorry! Your sister must be in shock...
6827,<|emo_disgust|> Wow I had no idea [NAME] was married
6828,"<|emo_disgust|> Man I hate when people say, ""All meat comes from slaughtered animals."" *aggressively tells friend.*"
6829,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh look, it's your fault for being ugly."
6830,<|emo_disgust|> When you see a child get shot in the head you realize what a horrible thing to do.
6831,<|emo_disgust|> They’re just assholes.
6832,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is trash. He is not a statesman.
6833,<|emo_disgust|> I like it. It's more For ladies Only here
6836,"<|emo_disgust|> Ouch, now I feel bad for you [NAME]."
6838,<|emo_disgust|> He was in an awful accident. A man's fault for driving.
6839,<|emo_disgust|> Oh no I didn’t hear you say her hair is greasy.
6840,<|emo_disgust|> What a weird dude
6841,<|emo_disgust|> Why tho? Because it actually makes me really mad how much [NAME] is wrong with this. He's very good at this. The rest are also very bad
6842,<|emo_disgust|> So the false accusation is almost beside the point. It's creepy that she's lied to her face-to face with no record of any crime.
6843,<|emo_disgust|> It is strange but true
6844,<|emo_disgust|> I knew someone posted it but I couldn't find the link. Sorry if that was the post
6845,<|emo_disgust|> No one loves me
6846,<|emo_disgust|> Now that’s wild abuse.
6847,<|emo_disgust|> It's not *my* fault the girls I slept with were all horrible people.
6848,<|emo_disgust|> No wonder the unemployment rate is sky high.
6849,"<|emo_disgust|> The saddest thing is she’s 30. Just gonna say, divorce is hard but if that isn’t out of your reach then you probably don’t care. "
6851,<|emo_disgust|> Why can't I just be more thankful for the blessings I have and be able to turn that pain into something positive now
6852,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, there it is"
6853,<|emo_disgust|> But how dare she not find domestic abuse funny! /s
6854,<|emo_disgust|> The weird thing is that half the stories that concern me concern people who are neither [NAME] nor [NAME]
6855,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] are a cancer in our society
6856,<|emo_disgust|> Oh. The irony.
6857,"<|emo_disgust|> This, to me, is the most infuriating."
6858,<|emo_disgust|> i still feel very resentful and mad at myself
6860,<|emo_disgust|> The worst of the Worst. Just remember that you are not special or that there are worse things in the world than this. But realize that you are special! 
6861,<|emo_disgust|> Why would anyone want to drive on that road? You just don’t want to get into a crash like that.
6863,"<|emo_disgust|> That's a really good point, I'm honestly stumped."
6864,"<|emo_disgust|> People saying ""it's stupid and terrible"" are the exact same people that said ""it's not stupid, it's amazing how amazing it's gotten"""
6865,<|emo_disgust|> Weird game to play with Stick people
6866,<|emo_disgust|> He’s an anti-Semite. That’s his entire argument. Disgusting.
6867,<|emo_disgust|> That's so frustrating. I can't imagine thinking worse than that.
6868,<|emo_disgust|> But even worse. They are turning into ISIS. Because our government has let them. What a joke.
6869,<|emo_disgust|> It could be worse. Imagine if he doesn’t get injured and sign another QB. Imagine he goes back to NO at any point.
6870,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]! I'm sick of losing to Winnipeg and I hate your face
6871,<|emo_disgust|> I love you but.... [NAME]
6872,"<|emo_disgust|> I have no idea if he's right, but I'm definitely not being a moron. Thanks. I really appreciate it. "
6874,"<|emo_disgust|> Well that sucks, good luck to you. I hope you and him make it. Hugs "
6875,"<|emo_disgust|> It was a bad one, I don't think it was that bad"
6877,<|emo_disgust|> We deserve what we get. No apologies needed.
6878,<|emo_disgust|> The people at /r/Drama are the ones being drama queen-like and unappreciative of the roleplay and giving the other authors room to post more.
6879,<|emo_disgust|> That's so disgusting. How do you sleep at 3am?
6880,<|emo_disgust|> He is an irate old brown woman.
6882,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I see it all the time and it's gross
6884,"<|emo_disgust|> I’m a huge fan of his, but he absolutely does get walked all over."
6885,<|emo_disgust|> She reminds me of a California Raisin!!
6886,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. :(
6887,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that she is half asleep makes me think she's about to fall asleep.
6888,"<|emo_disgust|> Who's worse, a corrupt newspaper or a mafia crime family"
6889,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird that they have one off Whiteout road in the middle of nowhere
6891,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst advice I've ever read. Your friends can agree with you. Stop comforting people like this.
6892,<|emo_disgust|> The lack of color in this drawing is... pretty bad.
6894,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was a good two year vet but he just doesn’t have the legs to defend.
6895,<|emo_disgust|> Well damn. Have at you bitches.
6896,"<|emo_disgust|> The first thought that crossed my mind was ""man this is horrible"" but what the hell. I was so wrong."
6897,<|emo_disgust|> It's not a *scary* picture; it's a picture that genuinely terrifies me.
6898,<|emo_disgust|> Damn it
6899,<|emo_disgust|> It’s a weird thing people do. I’m just wondering how.
6900,"<|emo_disgust|> But anyway the thing is, it's a shame because it will probably draw a lot of people to the area. It'll probably also get a lot more people coming."
6901,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, you just outsmarted them there. Surprises me how often that works."
6902,<|emo_disgust|> He still a freakin' idiot tho
6903,<|emo_disgust|> Oh damn the cold was on!!!!
6904,<|emo_disgust|> That damn [NAME] jersey.
6905,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking weird thing to say.
6906,<|emo_disgust|> Why are you so angry? You're not angry as a person. You're angry because you think people like you somehow have a special place in society.
6907,<|emo_disgust|> It’s stupid and it hurts.
6908,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you say that already?
6909,<|emo_disgust|> He’s going to hell...
6910,<|emo_disgust|> Who is this? I hate him!
6911,<|emo_disgust|> You are a hideous shade of your own shade. One of the worst people I have seen.
6912,"<|emo_disgust|> That is sick. Im disgusted that she thinks Reddit is any more ""progressive"" thanahoo!"
6913,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has never missed a field goal in his career...at any level.
6914,<|emo_disgust|> So much bullshit
6915,<|emo_disgust|> And that hat? Who wore that?
6916,<|emo_disgust|> Damn no shame in that.
6917,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird, I'm not a [NAME], so I'm probably 5'11"" or so."
6918,"<|emo_disgust|> The only advice I can give is to avoid Reddit entirely. That's pretty heavy, and I hate it."
6919,<|emo_disgust|> Well what do you guys have against the rich? They actually gave some away.
6920,<|emo_disgust|> The media bias is astounding.
6922,<|emo_disgust|> This is what keeps me awake at night. Imagine if your sister got caught with 10lbs of meth and asked you to get help.
6923,"<|emo_disgust|> I hate the ""I don't care!"" people."
6925,<|emo_disgust|> He’s a disgusting insecure rich insecure idiot
6926,"<|emo_disgust|> They just don’t like women who are pregnant. They’re just totally sicknesses, which I can understand. I also have sleep apnea and it sucks"
6927,<|emo_disgust|> That’s rude af. I’m sorry you have such a hard time.
6928,"<|emo_disgust|> But wait, wasn't the city itself in ruin? What about the surrounding area?"
6930,<|emo_disgust|> Why is this still downvoted 5 days?!?!?!? Why is this not upvoted 5 days?!?!?!?
6931,<|emo_disgust|> That comment was later removed by /u/The_OD] but it still makes me sad.
6932,<|emo_disgust|> I dont like the way you worded this comment.
6933,<|emo_disgust|> She's a terrible debater.
6935,<|emo_disgust|> i feel i had a little bit of a rude awakening today
6936,<|emo_disgust|> i was feeling a little bit agitated and anxious right now
6937,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm really sad, but it sounds like [NAME] has a really good chance at being our coach."
6938,"<|emo_disgust|> Damnit [NAME], where the fuck does the sun go after it shines?!"
6939,"<|emo_disgust|> You don't know what you're talking about, and what you're implying is completely false."
6940,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]. I want to murder those people for saying those awful things.
6941,<|emo_disgust|> Why everyone hates [NAME] so much I’m surprised Google hasn’t done a similar thing.
6942,<|emo_disgust|> Man I hate Instagram.
6943,"<|emo_disgust|> It's bad form to show hate for a fellow [NAME], how can you be that bad of a guy?"
6944,<|emo_disgust|> This is so creepy and so sad. #playdespacito
6945,<|emo_disgust|> I'm just saying that you have a huge amount of self-doubt and that makes it even worse
6947,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a cancer on our sports media.
6948,<|emo_disgust|> It sounds like this is the only game he actually played - seems like a weird character to play with someone like that...
6949,<|emo_disgust|> They probably just did for the sake of not making the labor market more competitive.
6950,<|emo_disgust|> This hurts me just thinking about it.
6951,<|emo_disgust|> Just goes to show how evil the left is
6952,<|emo_disgust|> There is a special sadness in finding out that no matter how hard you look it won’t happen
6953,<|emo_disgust|> I dont give a damn about his football team or basketball team.
6954,<|emo_disgust|> They should just be glad they woke up. It should have just been us. They were in a treehouse with the rest of us.
6955,<|emo_disgust|> Who cares :D
6956,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you put x on the same level as [NAME]! Outrageous.
6957,<|emo_disgust|> It was in a movie that focused on drugs and I felt that scene was disgusting. Your dad is an obnoxious drunk but that scene is actually a metaphor for a lot of messed up shit.
6958,<|emo_disgust|> If you were to give me a grade for this article I’d give it a B
6959,<|emo_disgust|> It's called the gulag. It's the world's most repressive penal code.
6960,<|emo_disgust|> If your going to do something then it is probably not worth doing.
6961,<|emo_disgust|> But he’s worse than [NAME] who is just awful
6963,<|emo_disgust|> I hate these memes.
6965,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst thing I've ever seen. It really is.
6966,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking hell..
6967,<|emo_disgust|> Oh the horror!
6969,<|emo_disgust|> That was a brutal shift by the backchecks. [NAME] on Dzone still seems awful but at least he was aggressive.
6970,<|emo_disgust|> He isn't angry. He's just sad.
6971,<|emo_disgust|> She looks like [NAME] and is a hideous hag.
6972,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting and disgusting. The man in the orange jacket should be sent to priso- oh I forgot about priso
6973,<|emo_disgust|> What a stupid thing to say.
6974,"<|emo_disgust|> No, this is a lie/ fabrications. They've tried this many times and it's just not effective."
6975,<|emo_disgust|> We didn't actually want [NAME] in our team. He was great in our offense but not so great in our defense.
6976,<|emo_disgust|> I hate Facebook
6977,"<|emo_disgust|> How dare you say that [RELIGION] is a religion. You are a ignorant, heathen. How dare you."
6978,"<|emo_disgust|> The fuck? Those are some bulge-ass muscles, kidd. Those are real, real fucking bulges. "
6980,"<|emo_disgust|> Who is afraid of [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], the fire ants? And [NAME] himself! We will victorious!"
6981,<|emo_disgust|> This is the kind of thinking that led directly to 9/11....
6982,"<|emo_disgust|> That whole ""thug"" part killed me! I really want to see that part tbh."
6984,<|emo_disgust|> It was a terrible call...the refs missed it
6985,<|emo_disgust|> I think it's just a terrible system. If [NAME] is 30 in 2020 he can just get worse and worse...
6986,"<|emo_disgust|> I just don't feel he was abused at all. Even compared to [NAME], he was basically a worse defender."
6987,<|emo_disgust|> Shut up Dude
6988,<|emo_disgust|> I just can't. All the feelings of being unloved and hopeless and rejected and alone are still with me.
6989,<|emo_disgust|> I want it so bad but I’m only 16.
6990,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, it's still a bit creepy."
6991,"<|emo_disgust|> So...yiff, too bad there is some actual good in there. What a shame it isn't more common. Just saying."
6992,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck those lousybums
6994,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] this is so disgusting.
6996,<|emo_disgust|> That would be a flagrant abuse of our precious civil rights act.
6997,<|emo_disgust|> The one on the left looks kinda scary
6998,<|emo_disgust|> Weird. Maybe more of a lefty leaning anarchism which is probably why it has been around for so long.
6999,<|emo_disgust|> This guy had a bad year.
7001,"<|emo_disgust|> Not [NAME] you dumbass, get a medical degree before you fuck me up"
7002,<|emo_disgust|> Oh absolutely! All the people in there are lovely people and the place itself is really quite nice.
7004,<|emo_disgust|> I don’t even like her I don’t think she’s that bright 🤰
7005,"<|emo_disgust|> You have made your wife and children into overnight guests, and you're outraged because her family members are guests. "
7006,<|emo_disgust|> I'm in my late 40s and I still cringe at the things I'm seeing here.
7007,<|emo_disgust|> Lol [NAME] - you're such a weirdo
7008,<|emo_disgust|> I can’t really think of any [NAME] moments where I would fault them at all. They’re a fucking machine.
7009,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking hate [NAME].....
7010,<|emo_disgust|> What the hell?!
7011,<|emo_disgust|> Because people have a right to say dumb shit in the fucking internet.
7013,<|emo_disgust|> I've heard of this...I've also asked many people who have said the same but haven't been able to get a response.
7015,<|emo_disgust|> >Clerks are goddamnable. And I swear that the men in this video are fucking horrifying.
7016,<|emo_disgust|> The saddest part is he doesn’t even know it was a dare.
7017,<|emo_disgust|> I was getting kind of freaked out watching this
7018,<|emo_disgust|> I don't care for people that spend time on Reddit
7019,<|emo_disgust|> Now you're saying the city councilman who resigned because he wanted to live in his house all the time is a charlatan.
7022,<|emo_disgust|> Man so annoying.
7023,"<|emo_disgust|> That would be such an awful loss. Especially since you're looking for a new start. Stay, [NAME] is a great player but it's not his fault. :("
7024,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] looks awful
7025,<|emo_disgust|> Weird. Just weird.
7026,<|emo_disgust|> That’s disgusting. What kind of background do you have that would allow this?
7027,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, who cares?"
7028,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] and [NAME]: [NAME] and [NAME] was pretty much the worst supporting pair we have right now
7029,"<|emo_disgust|> My mom always says: ""Buying a house is like going to the Best high school in the land. Your going to be there until your 30's"""
7031,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is an absolute fool.
7032,"<|emo_disgust|> I'll have to agree, there were some absolutely awful moments in this movie. The use of shakycam made some of them worse. But the endearing side projects that character build up to were a icing on the cake."
7033,"<|emo_disgust|> Weirdly enough, not all men harass women..."
7034,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck off. Maybe you and your friends are onto something.
7035,<|emo_disgust|> I find�s weird but okay I've gotten used to it.
7036,<|emo_disgust|> You're a mean person and the only thing that saved you was your superior intelligence.
7037,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fucking idiot, but I still love football..."
7039,"<|emo_disgust|> ""You look like a man, not a woman"" I've watched that."
7041,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, I wanna hear these guys admit they sucked."
7042,"<|emo_disgust|> He’s a pro-Assad piece of shit, and a kook. Not quite the same thing."
7043,<|emo_disgust|> Well then what the fuck is your plan?
7044,"<|emo_disgust|> No, it's not.... I'm ashamed"
7045,<|emo_disgust|> When it’s on someone’s profile picture I think it’s pretty cringe.
7046,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, that's one way to get a girl out of a corner"
7047,<|emo_disgust|> i feel slightly offended
7048,<|emo_disgust|> This is a sad article. People with autism are extremely complicated.
7049,"<|emo_disgust|> Not the best either, but I like the picture..."
7050,<|emo_disgust|> It is strange how some people just won’t accept reality and will instead celebrate ignorance and idealism.
7051,<|emo_disgust|> This is so cringe. I actually had to load this up.
7052,<|emo_disgust|> i start feeling dissatisfied
7053,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh my [NAME] your job is to protect your parents, why are you here ruining their chances for anything?"
7054,<|emo_disgust|> She is probably cheating on you. :(
7055,<|emo_disgust|> I have a feeling OP is just as guilty...
7056,"<|emo_disgust|> How is it disgusting? I can't see a big slap, even an eyebrow, anywhere! "
7058,<|emo_disgust|> This is really creepy.
7059,"<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit, [NAME]!"
7060,<|emo_disgust|> People are a lot funnier when they start making horrible jokes on purpose.
7061,<|emo_disgust|> Holy crap I just posted that video
7062,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I know a woman who survived an attack by a dog
7063,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, lordy, that was worse than 5 threes."
7064,"<|emo_disgust|> I can smell the worry in her eyes as she gets to her feet. ""I'm sorry you are feeling so homesick I sent you away""."
7065,<|emo_disgust|> That is awful. I love playing him but that was a terrible call.
7066,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I can't believe he went on that show, it would absolutely destroy my opinion of [NAME]"" Wow that’s the exact quote I said to him."
7067,<|emo_disgust|> This is so cute.
7068,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I guess but that doesn't mean we havent beaten them in the league
7070,<|emo_disgust|> I am more than pleasantly surprised he did not campaign for her
7071,<|emo_disgust|> You’re not good because you don’t like [NAME] or the team he's on or the guy he hired. You’re bad because none of those are any good or bad in themselves.
7072,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, that's racist."
7073,<|emo_disgust|> If there is still snow on the ground at this time of year it is probably hail.
7076,"<|emo_disgust|> The last message was particularly bad as it read: ""This message is being sent to a group of potential rapists"""
7077,<|emo_disgust|> You're a monster
7078,<|emo_disgust|> I know a guy who is. If it's anything like [NAME] is it's even worse.
7079,<|emo_disgust|> Whoa this is really creepy
7080,<|emo_disgust|> Weird comment.
7081,<|emo_disgust|> The dude is a weirdo.
7082,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is playing dirty here. He has to know there's no way [NAME] should be in this locker room
7083,<|emo_disgust|> You had a close bet on a dude. You lost. What a fucking asshole.
7085,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, I can deal with those myself. I hope they go well for you guys. Sorry to heard about the unfortunate event."
7086,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is worse, btw"
7087,<|emo_disgust|> He looked like a porn star in drag
7088,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fucking psychopath
7089,"<|emo_disgust|> Lol, yeah, it’s terrible for his ego "
7090,<|emo_disgust|> No. This makes me wanna die
7091,<|emo_disgust|> I hate to say that but...yuck
7094,<|emo_disgust|> I didn't know you're that close of a friend.....fuck off
7095,<|emo_disgust|> This is a pretty good clue that [NAME] is a terrible romantic.
7096,<|emo_disgust|> This is so creepy omg lmfao
7097,<|emo_disgust|> She might actually be a horrible democrat though. I’m pretty sure she’s been too busy being a horrible democrat to do much else.
7098,<|emo_disgust|> Oh man that's just so cringe
7099,"<|emo_disgust|> Whoops, sorry. Wasn't thinking of the root of the problem. is bad because we let them"
7100,<|emo_disgust|> Now my entire bad pun is just a metaphor
7101,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, what a shame. My [NAME] used to do the exact same thing. So I had to ask her about it..."
7102,<|emo_disgust|> No. That’s creepy and weird
7104,"<|emo_disgust|> No, that’s the worst possible outcome. :("
7105,"<|emo_disgust|> Lol I'm from Turkey and hate everything aboutErdoğan, from the minute he entered office to now. Even his jokes are funnier when you're from Turkey."
7106,"<|emo_disgust|> You should send them some cake, their reaction can be hilarious!"
7107,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't care for her at all, and then there's still this"
7108,<|emo_disgust|> If you have anything in common or knowledge with the guy in question I am very sorry. Stay away from him and do what you can to distance yourself.
7109,<|emo_disgust|> How unfortunate that this was written about him...
7110,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]? He's the son of [NAME] and [NAME]. I hate him, god damn him"
7111,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, don’t blame [NAME] for that...."
7112,<|emo_disgust|> I hate to say this but I love [NAME]. I wish he'd stay.
7113,"<|emo_disgust|> That's so disgusting, and a slap in the face to any other woman who faces similar situations."
7114,<|emo_disgust|> That’s a terrible upper body position to be in if your head is just above the floor
7116,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is such a fucking idiot lol.
7117,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], that dress is awful."
7118,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, sorry. Can I have a moment of silence for your loss today?"
7120,<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting. Now go and make a profit from child abuse.
7121,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is bad on third down.ively.
7122,<|emo_disgust|> That is beyond fucking creepy.
7123,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, hate that [NAME] is our speaker."
7124,<|emo_disgust|> Because itoffends your FUCKING stomach
7125,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, people will always say things that aren't actually true."
7128,<|emo_disgust|> i feel a bit agitated and out of it all day today which is my usual state
7129,<|emo_disgust|> No the real problem is he abused his parents relationship. He need to get his life together and divorce his ex while she is still a virgin. 
7130,<|emo_disgust|> My mother is the world's most useless incompetent person ever.
7132,<|emo_disgust|> When that intro drops I get so into it and get so into it that I accidentally bang the ceiling
7133,<|emo_disgust|> Wow that's disgusting
7134,<|emo_disgust|> You fucking know he won.
7135,<|emo_disgust|> I do not. This is creepy.
7136,<|emo_disgust|> Not really a surprise. He's had relationships with women who are significantly older.
7137,<|emo_disgust|> We will never find a forgiveness even as much as we want to. We are all created equal and noone deserves to be treated worse than this
7138,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is hurting your jersey
7139,<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry. That whole thread smells even worse than the pizza thread.
7140,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fucking piece of shit.
7142,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so selfish for loving the world around me so much and only caring about myself
7144,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is bad
7145,<|emo_disgust|> What a sad and angry statement. I'm so sorry you had to go through something like that.
7146,<|emo_disgust|> i feel really pissed off about this
7147,<|emo_disgust|> They'd hate it too if we brought in a bunch of internationals and started giving them $100k+ a year.
7150,<|emo_disgust|> That’s worse
7151,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fuckin monster, and I LOVE him."
7152,<|emo_disgust|> That’s some sick body language from you that’s just awful.
7154,<|emo_disgust|> It's absolutely disgusting.
7156,"<|emo_disgust|> No, it’s not. It actually makes me feel worse. She just wanted to be with me, but now she wants to be with a guy/girl She hasn‘t even kissed yet"
7157,<|emo_disgust|> The weird thing is I thought I was the only person that hated them.
7158,"<|emo_disgust|> No, no. It is not."
7159,<|emo_disgust|> The fact his left arm is still armadillo is probably the most disturbing part. [NAME] is so dumb with his arm.
7160,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] that was disgusting. Lord [NAME] has absolutely failed [NAME].
7161,<|emo_disgust|> You're horrible
7163,<|emo_disgust|> Well good for you! I would never even dare put forward as opinion. But I understand your frustration sometimes!
7164,<|emo_disgust|> That one hit was close to the goalpost and the ref was wrong
7165,<|emo_disgust|> Because people who post hate on him tend to have low standards for others.
7166,<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting. An STI should be difficult and specific. This is not it.
7167,<|emo_disgust|> A fat DnD kid told a DnD kid to stop being a baddy for being a [NAME] for playing hockey.
7168,<|emo_disgust|> So disgusting
7169,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is here to complain about shit, the newbies don’t even deserve an interview"
7170,<|emo_disgust|> Oh fuck off. Being upset about something does not grant you rights. You have no rights to an opinion you don’t like.
7171,<|emo_disgust|> She would be an awful president.
7172,<|emo_disgust|> Man... This was the worst pass I've ever thrown.
7173,"<|emo_disgust|> Not a problem in itself, but I hate when people assume things “we’re so OP “by their standards”."
7174,<|emo_disgust|> So sorry to hear about that! Good news is you get a $5 gift card to use again!
7175,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh absolutely. I see a lot of posts on here about it being a problem with men, not women"
7176,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]...no, I'm not. I'm just frustrated that the top guys at different times throughout his tenure at SDSU haven't received the same treatment from the athletic director and certainly haven't felt that pressure to play well to an expected outcome."
7177,<|emo_disgust|> Man that ass is fucking thick
7178,"<|emo_disgust|> No need to say, he's extremely creepy "
7179,<|emo_disgust|> You're a piece of shit.
7180,<|emo_disgust|> She can't even do better than [NAME] and [NAME] when they were in their prime
7181,<|emo_disgust|> The problem is the US
7183,<|emo_disgust|> He's creepy.
7184,<|emo_disgust|> What a crap team they were that week. Worst loss ever by our state
7185,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a creepy ho
7186,<|emo_disgust|> This is an awful meme
7187,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, I know [NAME] but I have no idea who [NAME] is."
7188,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is just jealous i dont like him
7190,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking autist.
7191,<|emo_disgust|> But I don't. Just can't. My life is complete
7192,<|emo_disgust|> This is kinda creepy to be honest.
7193,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]? Never heard of him...he seems pretty toxic on the mic.
7195,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, this is dope"
7196,<|emo_disgust|> What the actual fuck....
7197,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm saying [NAME] does, and the media loves it. Do your job and report the truth."
7200,"<|emo_disgust|> I don’t really care for [NAME] at all, but I’m surprised it hasn’t been more pointed. The crowd didn’t really booed him"
7202,"<|emo_disgust|> The ""I don't care"" part killed me. This is why we need compassion in our politics."
7204,<|emo_disgust|> People are always cruel to pets. If it wasn't so cruel I wouldn’t be against pet ownership in the first place.
7205,"<|emo_disgust|> This is the saddest post ever. So, so sad."
7207,<|emo_disgust|> I’m really fucking surprised they got on at all. I’m certain that was a big contributing factor.
7208,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, your a muh racist now"
7209,"<|emo_disgust|> So? What do I want from a relationship, what's important? I hate him so much."
7210,<|emo_disgust|> i feel guilty and want to find a way back even if it is with hard work
7211,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, so it's more about *sexual* attraction?"
7212,"<|emo_disgust|> i know in my heart that this is a great way to start off year by, it means all the little things that are holding us back, or that something that is holding us back right now"
7213,<|emo_disgust|> Damn [NAME] is getting ready for a fight tonight or tomorrow lol
7215,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like i ve been a little selfish but i feel very blessed and very lucky to live in a place where im completely accepted
7216,"<|emo_disgust|> No one likes me, so no one will like you either."
7217,"<|emo_disgust|> This is a weird thing I've noticed, I hope you can understand why I am surprised it's happening. Thanks for the correction, OP. "
7218,<|emo_disgust|> Oh so you're telling me ‘moo moo’ thats how it works ‘em
7220,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, that's just fucking weird."
7221,"<|emo_disgust|> What's so weird about it? Like if it says, ""We also have a 15% off special deal on this"""
7222,<|emo_disgust|> They’re scared
7223,<|emo_disgust|> I am very sorry for you lost loved ones that day. I truly am.
7224,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn it. I'm so sorry that happened to you. Please try to find someone who will take you if you ever find them, or something to comfort you."
7226,<|emo_disgust|> No way my friends that played helped the worst. That's just...lacking in some way.
7227,"<|emo_disgust|> Your a horrible person and a hypocrite for using the word ""kikes"" to describe yourself."
7228,"<|emo_disgust|> This one is my favorite, the others are kinda forgettable."
7229,"<|emo_disgust|> It's not unique, it's damned continued."
7230,"<|emo_disgust|> And worst of all, is the parent who is somehow gullible enough to send the entire house into a destructive tailspin with the parent along for the ride!"
7231,<|emo_disgust|> That's one vicious cat.
7232,"<|emo_disgust|> I was going to say the same. It just clouds my decision making, and makes me look like an angry elf. "
7233,<|emo_disgust|> The only way isn't to have a gun lol. There are a lot of good reasons to not have one
7234,<|emo_disgust|> Well that fucking sucks son
7235,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. Does it not?
7237,<|emo_disgust|> And you wouldn't even have to pay any taxes to receive it...ugly right?
7238,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a sex doll and you’re not allowed to question her about your feelings for her? Stop with all the sassiness
7239,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn I hope so...
7242,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you neglect [NAME] [NAME] and [NAME]
7243,<|emo_disgust|> There's a weird thing happening right here. I have no idea what it's about but it's terrifying.
7244,<|emo_disgust|> What a sick mambo
7245,<|emo_disgust|> This shit gets posted daily on this sub. What a load of crap.
7246,<|emo_disgust|> You should say something racist!
7247,<|emo_disgust|> It’s hard to look at!
7249,<|emo_disgust|> The lack of any decent women? Are you fcking serious?
7252,<|emo_disgust|> I hate poetry
7254,<|emo_disgust|> It's so horrifying how clean our air is compared to other developed countries.
7255,<|emo_disgust|> Weird flex...
7256,<|emo_disgust|> This is just awful. Can't imagine ever having a child like this. What a nightmare.
7257,<|emo_disgust|> They’re all creepy but [NAME] and [NAME] really stand out.
7258,<|emo_disgust|> Who dares challenge him
7259,<|emo_disgust|> I hope you don’t think for a moment that the [NAME] aren’t racists.
7260,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm thinking, if the suspect actually swears a lot, maybe that's a problem."
7261,"<|emo_disgust|> No, we live in a very violent society. "
7263,<|emo_disgust|> Don't know an answer to this but I'd be more worried about their ability to defend than their shooting if we started 0-4 
7264,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is pretty shit, y'all."
7265,<|emo_disgust|> Now that we have it on the record as an official statement...F uck!
7266,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I don't know what I'm talking about.
7267,"<|emo_disgust|> My wife's family is one of the most backwards, racist, sexist, homophobic, ignorant, violent, mentally ill, ignorant, violent animals I have ever seen."
7268,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, that’s awful. I love [NAME] but that’s awful."
7269,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] I felt [NAME]!
7270,<|emo_disgust|> Don't call me [NAME]. I don't run toward him.
7272,<|emo_disgust|> Worst president ever.
7274,<|emo_disgust|> So much guilt!
7275,<|emo_disgust|> That’s a terrible number
7276,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is fucking destroying Bama this year
7277,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch. That hurt too much to watch twice in a row. Good riddance to awful rubbish.
7278,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn don’t sell, it is fucking insane "
7280,<|emo_disgust|> And there you have it. I say fuck this year but I can see 2017 being good (unlike usual). I hate the heat 
7282,<|emo_disgust|> The most terrifying things that can possibly happen to me are getting beaten up by a drunk driver.
7283,<|emo_disgust|> This isn't even a meme. It's a serious threat. Do something about it.
7284,"<|emo_disgust|> We didn't even get a new intro in the trailer. We got a dull introduction with the start to the game, and a new ending which makes me kinda upset and sad for [NAME]."
7285,<|emo_disgust|> I'm sad. For a moment I thought this was just a subreddit about cats. I feel so useless for doing nothing.
7286,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is getting his ASS handed to him every play. Take him out of your game.
7287,<|emo_disgust|> The only one to truly appreciate the team effort and hard work on the back 8s last night.
7288,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like i could have wrote the book in 10 minutes and it would have been a really boring story
7289,"<|emo_disgust|> And no, it isn’t fake news... just a combination of bad execution and an unrepresentative sample."
7290,<|emo_disgust|> Just be insulted a lot
7291,<|emo_disgust|> Who would have thought [NAME] was that bad...
7292,"<|emo_disgust|> My mom's reaction was more along the lines of ""you're a freakin' weirdo"""
7293,<|emo_disgust|> You’re a weirdo.
7294,<|emo_disgust|> That man is beyond pathetic and disgusting.
7295,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a madman.
7298,<|emo_disgust|> Wow that’s disgusting
7299,<|emo_disgust|> Shut up nerd
7300,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not ashamed of you for being a [NAME]. I'm ashamed of how society views this type of behavior.
7301,<|emo_disgust|> Who said I hated him? I hated the Angels a lot
7302,<|emo_disgust|> No. Who cares? The guy did it anyway so what's the problem?
7303,<|emo_disgust|> My bad I just looked it up! Thanks for the correction! 😂
7304,<|emo_disgust|> Your ex doesn't get it either? So your only option is an expensive affair.
7305,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I hate that too. I'm a foodie and I love being in cities. It's just a hell of a detox!
7306,"<|emo_disgust|> This is so disgusting and honestly, I'm glad she's out of our lives. Now, we'll never know what exactly will happen to you since you went through this."
7307,<|emo_disgust|> If you go by the old map it's more of a straight brown line on what amounts to a shitty old US state.
7308,<|emo_disgust|> In what fucking world is this drawing not bad!?!?!? And is it not awful!?! The hell is wrong with this!?!?
7309,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is scared out there. What a play....
7311,"<|emo_disgust|> He gets all the fan hate, but he actually does a really good job at articulating how he feels about the sport. /s"
7312,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I left the industry years ago. It's worse than I thought it'd be.
7313,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck [NAME] for continuing to give her a platform.
7314,"<|emo_disgust|> A lot of people get mad at me for saying this, but I think we canalk it."
7315,"<|emo_disgust|> She likes to eat babies. I'm sorry, but don't feed your whore a 'pie Rocket' bar."
7316,"<|emo_disgust|> So, your an actual racist? Sorry man, good to know"
7317,<|emo_disgust|> What’s a [NAME] joke?
7318,<|emo_disgust|> How dare people tell you what to do with your life! some heads up.
7319,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] makes them so much worse, they really need to be banned"
7321,<|emo_disgust|> I mean it’s pretty cringe
7322,<|emo_disgust|> I'll be more worried if her ex boyfriend doesn't send her a second picture of the new engagement ring that they're signing
7323,"<|emo_disgust|> I do believe they were pressured to do this, there was a public hearing held over the summer after it was discovered that some staff were cheating. I also believe that the school hierarchy wanted to silence them, even if the claims are true"
7324,<|emo_disgust|> What are you talking about? Stop posting these kinds of posts.
7325,"<|emo_disgust|> Because ""bad"" people have more of a incentive to lie to their victims"
7327,"<|emo_disgust|> Ouch, what a horrible list"
7328,<|emo_disgust|> What's really sad about this is that this thread is so focused on finding the idiot (this person) instead of doing anything productive
7329,<|emo_disgust|> And you still aren't making enough money for her..!
7330,"<|emo_disgust|> She really just can't seem to get away with being a piece of shit sometimes, so..."
7331,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh you poor, poor [NAME]"
7332,<|emo_disgust|> Your mind isaze
7333,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking idiotic post omg
7334,"<|emo_disgust|> Your wife is an awful human being, a horrible mother, and an awful person."
7335,<|emo_disgust|> i feel slightly disgusted that i actually have to agree with this
7336,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing left to say is that this sucks
7337,<|emo_disgust|> So much loneliness.
7338,<|emo_disgust|> They are just saying stupid shit to try to be liked
7339,"<|emo_disgust|> You don't, you're a vile and callous piece of filth."
7340,<|emo_disgust|> If you use these words in any other context its racist and I hate it
7342,<|emo_disgust|> He has had run ins with the law over the years for a variety of crimes.
7344,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch that hurts just watching that
7345,<|emo_disgust|> This was a really dumb post and I hate that people think being fat means being uneducated.
7346,<|emo_disgust|> This is like the NoSleepyperson sub. The cringe is endless.
7347,<|emo_disgust|> I feel weird for liking them.
7348,<|emo_disgust|> And the only thing they can do? Burn it!
7349,<|emo_disgust|> You better be because today is the first day for me to get the full treatment. It is going to be miserable.
7350,<|emo_disgust|> We are all animals in this world. Why should someone care what your feelings and opinions are?
7352,<|emo_disgust|> Those are the sounds of a war crimes tribunal.
7353,"<|emo_disgust|> We're not exactly a bastion of goodness, but at least our government works."
7355,<|emo_disgust|> That's his impression anyway. I'm pretty sure it doesn't say “I’m not satisfied ”...
7356,<|emo_disgust|> You can't just say it's racist and it'll be headline news.
7357,"<|emo_disgust|> This guy has literally been guilty of nothing more than posting obnoxious memes for a while now, and while it’s still an obnoxious meme, it’s nowhere near as bad as [NAME] and [NAME]"
7359,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a horrible president.
7360,<|emo_disgust|> i don t feel like a petty bitch because youre not going to care or even notice my hair at all
7361,<|emo_disgust|> This is weird. No self-identification of sorts?
7362,<|emo_disgust|> They're weird
7363,"<|emo_disgust|> So, [NAME] is a bastard? I'm surprised he's a minister."
7364,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] why?
7365,<|emo_disgust|> She was really fucking creepy.
7366,<|emo_disgust|> The only way this dude gets fired would be if they find out he was defrauding people.
7368,"<|emo_disgust|> It's actually really disgusting as well.: you get no protection from the law against private property, yet you're rioting over it."
7369,<|emo_disgust|> The problem is they are stupid
7371,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so stupid not knowing all of these people but ive been friends with them and it makes me kind of pathetic how ignorant i seem
7372,<|emo_disgust|> Not bad at all.
7373,<|emo_disgust|> It's a weird thing to feel. Like a hard pain in the chest.
7374,<|emo_disgust|> The main reason I left my job and began blogging is because I started to dislike it.
7375,"<|emo_disgust|> They do believe in evil gods, that's why they build their churches in the middle of the desert."
7376,<|emo_disgust|> What a thot*
7378,<|emo_disgust|> I honestly miss [NAME] and [NAME]. :(
7380,"<|emo_disgust|> I will never say never, but this would make it so much worse."
7381,<|emo_disgust|> The guy is beyond cringe. This is awful.
7382,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah but I haven't watched the recent OTL, and I wasn't sure what that game was about yet. Weird. "
7383,<|emo_disgust|> There are enough people here that are weirdly angry at this.
7384,<|emo_disgust|> The first 10 minutes are some the worst I've ever seen.
7386,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not a fan of The Unfriendables. That movie was terrible.
7387,"<|emo_disgust|> But the ""cuck"" part killed me. It was so cringe-worthy."
7388,<|emo_disgust|> Why everyone loves her but hate [NAME] and [NAME] so much?
7389,"<|emo_disgust|> Whoops sorry, forgot to add ""but its a stupid game"""
7390,"<|emo_disgust|> You’re a stranger to me, don’t try to pick a fight with me"
7391,<|emo_disgust|> I did not know that the [NAME] in this are the same people who trash and demean the disabled.
7394,"<|emo_disgust|> In many ways, today’s the worst day of my life’s been pretty bad actually"
7395,"<|emo_disgust|> It's weird that [NAME] is a vegan. He's very into animal products, which is odd since he's a vegan."
7396,"<|emo_disgust|> I feel bad for that manager, who is probably out his ass in Arizona for all we know"
7397,<|emo_disgust|> So you're a liar and a child molester? You're so disgusting.
7398,<|emo_disgust|> I hate the ‘brown people’s’ media.
7399,"<|emo_disgust|> People are still going to call you ugly and claim you're making a career out of being this, and that it isn't possible to change. "
7400,<|emo_disgust|> Damn you are brainwashing me with your bullshit words. I am going to kill you today.
7401,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is better but I'll take [NAME] over [NAME] any day
7402,<|emo_disgust|> What in the actual fuck? How is this horrible
7403,<|emo_disgust|> I was in statesman's shorts a few days ago so it does me no good to say it. But that poor [NAME]
7404,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing he does is to alienate a partner because of some past behavior or something.
7405,<|emo_disgust|> Worst game of all time :(
7406,"<|emo_disgust|> There is now a special place in Hell for these people. Not happy, but not angels."
7407,<|emo_disgust|> Who killed you you?
7409,<|emo_disgust|> She was a child that had been molested. She was too young to remember her molest. It never crossed her mind that an adult could possibly do worse than abuse a child. Totally failed her.
7410,"<|emo_disgust|> If you are reading this on a mobile device, sorry. Your screen might be weird 😢"
7411,"<|emo_disgust|> Well he was mad when the CFF said all the things that got him then, and not before."
7414,"<|emo_disgust|> If he doesn’t give it up, he should face [NAME] in the second. [NAME] can’t guard him all game, and a 1st rounder who has played 1 game in the playoffs in his career."
7415,"<|emo_disgust|> He’s not wrong, I’ve heard the argument before. It’s because there is no way to say no."
7417,<|emo_disgust|> That man's face is impossibly ugly (in a good way)
7418,"<|emo_disgust|> > it is incredibly disrespectful to the memory of [NAME] And, I mean, it's still fucking disgusting"
7419,<|emo_disgust|> It's a weird thing to be angry about.
7421,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing to do is to become so devoted to one ideology or another that becomes the official state religion.
7422,<|emo_disgust|> No. They’re so damn adorable
7423,<|emo_disgust|> Not so fast! There is no specific report of him calling the cops.
7424,<|emo_disgust|> This is creepy and weird. Thanks for sharing. You have some explaining to do.
7425,<|emo_disgust|> This poor sap
7426,<|emo_disgust|> What did I just read....
7427,<|emo_disgust|> She’s an awful host
7428,<|emo_disgust|> She’s actually weird
7429,"<|emo_disgust|> >""Dude, what were you thinking? Shitpost about this shitpost"""
7430,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch. Those parents must have had a lot on their mind. That’s horrible. I hate that all the parents were against nature while the dad was for it.
7431,"<|emo_disgust|> I am from Shonely, just north of Edmonton. I'm terrified that this will affect my commute."
7432,<|emo_disgust|> He looks like he's taking a piss.
7433,"<|emo_disgust|> He's got worse taste in his mouth, dont let the poor man fool you. "
7434,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, we need a [NAME] joke. "
7435,"<|emo_disgust|> But [NAME] is worse! She's a blood thirsty, drug addled, drunk and violent bimbo!"
7436,"<|emo_disgust|> He didn't, he told you to come inside, he'll take it from here. That damn door you ^shouldn't have thrown open"
7437,<|emo_disgust|> Sooo...yuck
7438,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, I heard about them and thought about doing the same. Don't want to put any more stress on it."
7439,<|emo_disgust|> Because they are idiots.
7440,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking see that fat lass get up off her ass.
7441,<|emo_disgust|> That last bit was disgusting.
7442,<|emo_disgust|> Lol! I’m your friend here 😊
7443,<|emo_disgust|> You don't have any feet to stand on.
7444,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] that hurt me!
7445,<|emo_disgust|> What could have possibly caused the injuries that she sustained? And why did she go to the hospital?
7446,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm [RELIGION] but I have this weird thing for children.. They're like ""Dolls"""
7447,<|emo_disgust|> You’re calling on your loyal readers to shame the people who disagree with you? Fucking shame.
7449,<|emo_disgust|> This dude is fucking nuts
7450,<|emo_disgust|> Those shoes ruin that look
7451,"<|emo_disgust|> I’m pregnant! ""Waste of time"" is my favorite."
7452,<|emo_disgust|> I really love [NAME] but this all started even before their All Star break.
7455,"<|emo_disgust|> It's actually shockingly easy to become aist. It just takes time, but it's all soish so it's not easy."
7456,<|emo_disgust|> It’s racist
7457,<|emo_disgust|> That [NAME] guy definitely isn't [NAME].
7458,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, whoops."
7459,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing I want to hear about this is [NAME] says he's sorry for it
7461,<|emo_disgust|> i feel very dissatisfied in life
7462,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing worse than this is a company that needs to be sued for damages because of defective products.
7463,"<|emo_disgust|> The first comment was pretty bad, but the second made me chuckle so hard "
7464,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I would’ve hit him before he tried to take a swing at the umpire
7465,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating. What a waste of plastic.
7466,<|emo_disgust|> It's so fucking creepy that she didn't just run away.
7467,<|emo_disgust|> I've heard that said before but it's more of a derisive reference to the man.
7469,<|emo_disgust|> The secondhand panic and embarrassment I feel from reading these posts is astounding.
7470,<|emo_disgust|> It's disgusting how good our teams have been both years until december happens. The season is in the books now. Not the off season!!!!!!!!!
7471,"<|emo_disgust|> You could probably argue the same general point, but the point about using your own personal profit to further your own selfish ends seems more dubious."
7472,<|emo_disgust|> I'm so disturbed. You have a very present particulary present particulary voice! Eu!
7473,<|emo_disgust|> That looks like total garbage. I'm so sorry for your loss. 💜
7474,<|emo_disgust|> This post and thread are killing me [NAME].
7475,<|emo_disgust|> I just don’t like her
7476,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, we could've done it with [NAME] at QB instead of him"
7477,<|emo_disgust|> He’s a horrible person and I hate him so much.
7478,<|emo_disgust|> I mean the hate for the GCS basketball team was pretty extreme back then.
7479,<|emo_disgust|> Well the article didn't state for a fact that she's underage. If it did I'd be shocked about what she'll tell the cops
7482,<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest part is that he actually gave a positive alchoholic score. No idea what that even means.
7483,"<|emo_disgust|> This is awful. A lot of us still play, we just don't anymore. I'm also, unfortunately, an IT guy."
7485,<|emo_disgust|> They are still getting shut down for a host of reasons.
7486,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Ohi, your turn to be sauce."""
7487,<|emo_disgust|> I'm so fucking hungry right now
7488,<|emo_disgust|> My dad had the exact same problem and it left him with bad breath every time it came out.
7489,<|emo_disgust|> We all have those moments
7491,<|emo_disgust|> What you're doing is child abuse. Stop being so afraid to talk to adults about your needs and wants.
7493,<|emo_disgust|> Lol. I’m sorry you’re going through that. Hopefully this is just going to help. Get support now!
7494,<|emo_disgust|> That is the worst possible outcome
7495,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I left the industry.
7497,<|emo_disgust|> So much anxiety and such lousy communication skills!
7498,"<|emo_disgust|> This isn't about football. It's all mind games, and it's disgusting. "
7499,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, where did you get that idea?"
7500,<|emo_disgust|> Your a fucking moron moron
7502,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was awful...good riddance
7503,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, [NAME] sounds like the type of dorky loser I despise"
7504,<|emo_disgust|> Just thinking about all the people I've had sex with that didn't use birth CONTROL makes me want to die
7505,<|emo_disgust|> If you don't have more power you're a bad human being.
7506,<|emo_disgust|> I'm jealous.
7507,"<|emo_disgust|> She's worse than [NAME]. I'm with you, [NAME] is worse"
7508,<|emo_disgust|> There’s that saying... 'to kill the living day after they killed the living day'. I hate it.
7509,<|emo_disgust|> Who wants to fight a muay thai fighter? Boxing is boring so why bother?
7510,<|emo_disgust|> Oh....yuck
7513,<|emo_disgust|> What a weird thing people do.
7514,<|emo_disgust|> Shut up [NAME]
7516,<|emo_disgust|> I mean this is ridiculous and so are some of the things [NAME] is saying.
7519,<|emo_disgust|> Aghh!!!
7520,<|emo_disgust|> That's so creepy. Especially since that video actually showed him getting high.
7521,<|emo_disgust|> We all hate [NAME]
7522,<|emo_disgust|> Whoops it was me
7523,<|emo_disgust|> The real issue is the fact he has a history of erratic behavior.
7524,"<|emo_disgust|> No I didn’t like the prequel trilogy, I still don’t like current affairs either."
7528,<|emo_disgust|> It's hard to look at.
7529,"<|emo_disgust|> It feels like a blank sheet, like a blank piece of paper..."
7530,<|emo_disgust|> But in the worst possible way
7531,<|emo_disgust|> Your a horrible person.
7532,<|emo_disgust|> He is a creepy drunk.
7533,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah fuck your ass.
7534,<|emo_disgust|> I do think your age difference is a big red flag.
7535,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I missed that.
7536,<|emo_disgust|> This is so mean.
7538,<|emo_disgust|> We also had [NAME] being an absolute asshat on his show.
7539,<|emo_disgust|> There’s actually a surprisingly high number of [NAME] on our sub. They’re really only known to the general public
7540,<|emo_disgust|> If someone is a problem to society they need to be removed and punished.
7541,<|emo_disgust|> The weird flex.
7542,"<|emo_disgust|> It wasnt even one of those; the media was all over it, and for weeks after."
7543,<|emo_disgust|> i got on the phone a few days ago feeling quite pissed off
7545,<|emo_disgust|> Because rape is sometimes wrong? Look at that body
7546,<|emo_disgust|> It’s a fucking shite job on their behalf. I deserve badly assaulted and tortured for saying that about them
7548,<|emo_disgust|> The newscaster on that show was terrible.
7549,<|emo_disgust|> I mean the title is pretty terrible tbh.
7550,<|emo_disgust|> When it was discovered that [NAME] had lied about his age to get a job at Shell...
7551,<|emo_disgust|> He just doesn’t like losing. Lucky for him.
7552,<|emo_disgust|> He sounds hideous.
7555,<|emo_disgust|> Lol this is so infuriating. I’m glad you found some other way out.
7556,<|emo_disgust|> I got a fatomb. And it’s fake 😂
7557,<|emo_disgust|> I don't care anymore.
7558,"<|emo_disgust|> This is a really good question. My wife is extremely opinionated and this kind of thing is one that she broaches without even trying. She usually just says ""hmm"""
7561,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn they get it worst out of people with children, I mean it sucks that a grown man with a degree in pharmacy is the doctor instead of a bartender"
7564,<|emo_disgust|> And all along everyone hated him.
7565,"<|emo_disgust|> You'd think so, right? It was a pretty bizarre ""vote of no confidence"" in general"
7566,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is when no one replies.
7567,<|emo_disgust|> I could have gone for a real deep dives but I just didn't feel like it or I would have ended up hating my guts the entire way
7568,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. It's likely that others will also come away with similar conclusions.
7569,<|emo_disgust|> He’s a very nice guy but he’s a horrible debater. You’re better off just saying it.
7570,<|emo_disgust|> You don't see [NAME] as a person you see a collection of potential sexual partners.
7572,<|emo_disgust|> I’m more than annoyed I had to come this far down to find this.
7573,<|emo_disgust|> He was a moronic scumbag and a racist.all in all he may have been a decent human being.
7574,<|emo_disgust|> It was ugly.
7575,"<|emo_disgust|> Worst advice ever, this will piss you off, get past it."
7576,<|emo_disgust|> What a bitchy wet blanket.
7577,<|emo_disgust|> What a bummer. Now I'm stuck with just internet and YouTube.
7578,"<|emo_disgust|> It wasn't even a video game, it was a show you could watch. The point is it distracted kids from actual gaming."
7580,<|emo_disgust|> I honestly think the worst is when they ask you to do something you hate doing.
7581,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] that was truly disgusting
7584,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking disgusting.
7585,"<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell thought he was dead, seriously. Didn’t even look at the video - just another idiot..."
7588,"<|emo_disgust|> Why is it weird to call a 10 year old a ""torturer?"" ""Torturers"" are adults!"
7589,<|emo_disgust|> Because we actually want to be around the football field. Stop trying to pretend otherwise
7590,<|emo_disgust|> Fuckin em.
7591,<|emo_disgust|> The one sitting farthest from the QB is usually the hardest to pick on.
7592,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah but ""lazy ass"" doesn't really describe you at all."
7593,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing is doing the exact same thing over and over again.
7594,"<|emo_disgust|> What a bummer, [NAME]!"
7595,<|emo_disgust|> No offense intended but your parents are assholes.
7596,<|emo_disgust|> Oh I know like 10 of them but I didn't really care.
7599,"<|emo_disgust|> This is the saddest thing I've seen today, soul. "
7601,<|emo_disgust|> Why are all the girls in highschool making out in a car? And no one is forcing them to?
7602,"<|emo_disgust|> So sorry, for your loss."
7603,<|emo_disgust|> But it'll hurt
7604,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is going to turn some heads but I doubt he'll get an assist. 
7605,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking idiotic thing to say!
7607,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't even know what those lyrics are supposed to be, you're disgusting."
7609,<|emo_disgust|> The whole world is out for blood and guts!
7612,<|emo_disgust|> The real story is the awkwardness
7613,<|emo_disgust|> That's just sad. He knew the school was under investigation for some reason.
7614,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] what an asshole.
7615,"<|emo_disgust|> So this is why I hate [NAME] so much. Because he says the same exact thing, over and over, whenever somebody accuses him of anything."
7616,<|emo_disgust|> It was a horrible call
7617,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] would be happy for you to believe that [NAME] is being sincere and open with you so there’s that.
7618,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating. I'm literally sick to my stomach from reading all of these.
7619,<|emo_disgust|> What the bloody hell is the worst thing that you can do to someone who is upset that a loved one has died?
7620,<|emo_disgust|> It’s kinda sad that it doesn’t seem to have gotten much attention.
7622,<|emo_disgust|> What this has taught me about being an inadequate human being is that I need to learn just how goddamn hard it is to show kindness and compassion to a child.
7625,<|emo_disgust|> You might be a terrible human being.
7627,<|emo_disgust|> But it's still a bad law. What’s your point.
7628,<|emo_disgust|> I'm literally screaming at the screen
7629,<|emo_disgust|> Why do you care? We already have one idiot running this government
7631,"<|emo_disgust|> You mean 30,000 a day? Damn it."
7632,<|emo_disgust|> I’m a horrible person.
7633,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]? A fuckin n00b trying to steal my shit?! Just fucking move.
7634,<|emo_disgust|> Omg no way he’s cheating
7636,"<|emo_disgust|> It can be really creepy and awkward, I personally have found it."
7637,<|emo_disgust|> She's just mad because you did the right thing and didn't try to bully her into doing it.
7638,<|emo_disgust|> i feel a little stressed out with being in a small place just a few minutes from downtown and having so many students
7641,"<|emo_disgust|> The most disgusting part is this is getting downvoted. Get the mods to allow this, this is just gross!"
7642,<|emo_disgust|> I know just bantz.
7643,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking horrible list
7644,<|emo_disgust|> i feel a bit rude saying this but not all women are like this
7645,<|emo_disgust|> This is a bit creepy.
7646,<|emo_disgust|> i feel stressed out or anxious
7647,<|emo_disgust|> I think the title of your comment was sarcasm. Not trolling. A lot of people out there are.
7649,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling very impatient right now
7650,<|emo_disgust|> This article is dumb because [NAME] is a worse offensive player.
7651,<|emo_disgust|> That's an unpleasant waking nightmare.
7653,"<|emo_disgust|> Those women who gave birth to these babies are disgusting, I am so sorry they had to go through this."
7654,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is one of the scariest & weirdestass [NAME] in our lives.... keep an ear out for her
7655,<|emo_disgust|> How weird of him to say “I’m sleeping” while eating. That’s just weird.
7657,<|emo_disgust|> How can you hate [NAME] when theres plenty of shit on him😂
7658,"<|emo_disgust|> Just like the rest of the world isn’t gonna do shit about their rotten cat, it’s gonna do shit about ours"
7659,<|emo_disgust|> A fucking moron
7660,<|emo_disgust|> Oh wow sorry bud
7661,"<|emo_disgust|> When I saw the news about her ex, though, I was like, yeah I got so emotional watching this. I really need to talk to her about it. "
7663,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch I'm shaking. Don't tell me what to do.
7664,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, fuck the rangers"
7666,<|emo_disgust|> i would feel so fucking greedy not doing it
7667,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating. Tell her it is her birthday and to say sorry. Just tell her it was her birthday and she can have sex without you getting mad. 
7668,"<|emo_disgust|> She’s a horrible human being, and what she did was absolutely disgusting. "
7669,<|emo_disgust|> This guy was not remorseful in the slightest. How incredibly dangerous
7670,<|emo_disgust|> This fucking autocorrect fucken't mean shit
7671,<|emo_disgust|> That's some fuckin' Manipulation bro.
7672,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, some of the worse films I've ever seen. Noted."
7673,"<|emo_disgust|> Your a horrible person for posting that, good for you. I’m so sorry for your friend."
7674,<|emo_disgust|> She would say his face is pithy when he talks about it and how it makes her feel. Like a pissed off cow.
7675,<|emo_disgust|> It's a really creepy thing to say to someone with depression.
7676,"<|emo_disgust|> I still call bullshit on every one of his economic claims, and he goeson in with economic mumbo jumbo about how much he hates the [NAME] and the rest of us."
7677,<|emo_disgust|> In that pic you're right. Shameful.
7678,"<|emo_disgust|> Don't bother him, he already knows about the betrayals of [RELIGION] countries when it comes to information."
7679,<|emo_disgust|> I've heard great things about you on here! Have a good one. 😀
7680,<|emo_disgust|> I’m not crying... YOU’RE CUMING!!!!
7681,<|emo_disgust|> But even worse.
7682,<|emo_disgust|> There are way worse things!!
7683,<|emo_disgust|> I will never be less than horribly wronged
7684,"<|emo_disgust|> This guy is making a career out of insulting and demonizing gay people, which is pretty gross."
7685,<|emo_disgust|> This person should lose their job right away for this kind of comments
7686,<|emo_disgust|> That was a brutal goal
7687,<|emo_disgust|> Lol yes lol
7690,"<|emo_disgust|> If you're saying this about any of my videos, you've had a lot of years to watch them."
7692,<|emo_disgust|> How she is covered. The way that’s covered up is disgusting.
7693,<|emo_disgust|> i know how you feel i didnt give you a chance to speak
7695,<|emo_disgust|> She was horrible
7696,"<|emo_disgust|> It's horrible, what about you? It could be worse."
7697,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I’m sorry you are going through this.
7698,<|emo_disgust|> i was feeling stressed
7699,<|emo_disgust|> It’s been a weird couple hours.
7700,<|emo_disgust|> That's bad
7702,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck [NAME] and [NAME] for blocking funding for this for years and years. So glad it's being used to help people now!
7703,"<|emo_disgust|> No one has to go hungry in order for the U.S. to have ""taste"" and that they can be delicious."
7704,<|emo_disgust|> This is the only thing I’m upset I read this today. 🤔
7705,<|emo_disgust|> Those are horrible ears. I would never want to hear such awful squeaks.
7706,<|emo_disgust|> I have a problem with this too. I’m a [NAME]. I like my parents but I hate them.
7708,<|emo_disgust|> I see a lot of weird posts but not this. Very cool.
7709,<|emo_disgust|> No shit lol. Also that was so bad
7711,<|emo_disgust|> Those things could actually kill you. They're not meant to hurt you but they will.
7712,<|emo_disgust|> It's a weird thing people do
7713,<|emo_disgust|> I feel it is extremely dangerous to leave your pet in a car and let someone else deal with it.
7714,"<|emo_disgust|> No you don't, you're a big ugly fuk"
7716,<|emo_disgust|> This is really creepy. Good riddance.
7718,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn you, that was fucking gorgeous, I am sooo happy for you! 💜"
7719,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you. /s
7721,<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting. He should be embarrassed.
7722,"<|emo_disgust|> Fuck, I never even thought about that. I did believe that the universe was a big place until I got my cosmo"
7724,<|emo_disgust|> A fucking centaur.
7725,<|emo_disgust|> You're a horrible shade of lipstick.
7727,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I'm really uncomfortable when I'm with people that I really like. And I would hate with them around other people I really like.
7728,<|emo_disgust|> Not true at all. You could get away with much worse.
7729,"<|emo_disgust|> No, no, no, no, no. The third picture is horrifying."
7730,<|emo_disgust|> I don’t get her question. I see the video. She is a creepy little dipshit who is quite young.
7731,<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry dude I have a wife who also has a 4-inch penis.
7732,<|emo_disgust|> I think it's safe to say that I hate him more and more each day....
7733,<|emo_disgust|> He has no business running for prime minister. He didn’t promise not to bully the media!
7734,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] I hate this
7736,<|emo_disgust|> I always found his videos creepy and weird.
7737,<|emo_disgust|> I could drive my fucking van through there. Hell
7738,<|emo_disgust|> When its really bad.
7739,<|emo_disgust|> i had just finished reading a book about myself that i am really feeling quite irritated with myself when i have to ask why im writing a story telling blog about my life
7740,<|emo_disgust|> I hate to say it but I really like that he calls himself a racist.
7741,"<|emo_disgust|> That can only end badly, she could lose her baby suddenly"
7743,<|emo_disgust|> I'd piss right on their floor.
7744,<|emo_disgust|> I’m just here to say fuck [NAME]
7745,<|emo_disgust|> I really like this kid. The whole thing is cringe.
7746,<|emo_disgust|> Damn we needed that field goal.
7747,<|emo_disgust|> I thought for a moment you were implying that the president is a sexual predator. That's just flat out wrong.
7748,"<|emo_disgust|> If you don't like hot moms, that's fine. But you can't have a problem with hot dads."
7749,<|emo_disgust|> How is his wife still his sub? He's fucking creepy
7750,<|emo_disgust|> You better be.
7751,<|emo_disgust|> I think there's a good chance I'm making the same mistake you were. I'm just a little weirded out.
7754,<|emo_disgust|> Your husband is a moron.
7755,<|emo_disgust|> What a garbage post. Fucking shame.
7757,<|emo_disgust|> But the biggest Nightmare
7758,<|emo_disgust|> The weird thing is people think it's cute. What a weird thing to say.
7759,<|emo_disgust|> It would be weird if it was a video game...
7761,<|emo_disgust|> What a weird thing to say. I guess it’s just “want” to talk to you.
7762,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that she thinks this is funny is somehow even worse.
7763,<|emo_disgust|> I'm really just mad because the games are actually decent
7764,"<|emo_disgust|> You can't just say fuck [NAME] because that's the last thing you need to try to sell your country when you're a racist and sexist. Go ahead, call your racist/sexist/homophobic/idiot [NAME]."
7765,<|emo_disgust|> The worst part is that they're not even telling the truth about the situation.
7766,<|emo_disgust|> Oh I hate how much I love it
7767,"<|emo_disgust|> It's weird they use words like that about anything, seems like everyday."
7768,"<|emo_disgust|> Don't do it I say no, do it!"
7769,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I'm afraid to fly.
7770,<|emo_disgust|> Don't just distance yourself - BLOCK them
7771,<|emo_disgust|> Not even funny if your parents are middle level educated.
7773,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing is saying something that might put someone in danger
7774,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] sucks for that illegal deal he signed back in 2013. From what I understand it is a really old deal.
7775,"<|emo_disgust|> ""IT'S MY FAVORITE GAME TO HIVE AN EMOTE TO THE NERF WITH MY CHIP"""
7776,"<|emo_disgust|> I'd rather have [NAME] at 6 feet than [NAME]. You need height, else you're using stats from a shitty defense"
7777,<|emo_disgust|> And so is your dad. I'm literally shaking.
7779,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating. The only thing that stands between these two are their very cynical sense of justice.
7781,<|emo_disgust|> Now I'm crying before work thanks a lot.
7782,<|emo_disgust|> That one pissed off me the most.
7783,"<|emo_disgust|> I’m not crying, you’re crying!"
7784,"<|emo_disgust|> You can't make a meme about racism, that's what racists say."
7785,<|emo_disgust|> Omg no youre a weirdo
7786,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] does not care about how [NAME] treats women. She cares about how men treat women.
7787,<|emo_disgust|> She's definitely a horrible person and a terrible mother.
7788,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Bitch yes"""
7789,<|emo_disgust|> How [RELIGION] is the worst
7790,<|emo_disgust|> That’s horrible. I hope you’re doing OK. Really tough luck bro
7791,<|emo_disgust|> You're worse than some of the nazis you used to be friends with.
7793,<|emo_disgust|> He’s an idiot.
7795,<|emo_disgust|> Soooo [NAME] wasn't actually a [NAME] then...
7796,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, she still might be a terrible politician, but this was an effective ad for her. I’m surprised [NAME] would get involved. "
7797,<|emo_disgust|> And a new sub reddit account...and all the fake karma gods are coming...stop it
7798,<|emo_disgust|> So pathetic. No wonder outgoing [NAME] has her best buddy be a [NAME]
7799,<|emo_disgust|> The only way I'm sorry to hear that.
7800,<|emo_disgust|> She's just a bit of a wild woman
7801,<|emo_disgust|> Soooo... your a monster!
7803,"<|emo_disgust|> How can she have such high standards, then choose a man that she knows is a philanderer and cheat on him."
7804,<|emo_disgust|> They really are so terrible.
7805,<|emo_disgust|> The guy just lost his shit on the phone and then blamed the guy.
7806,<|emo_disgust|> A few words from [NAME] wouldnt assuage my discontent. Sorry dude
7807,<|emo_disgust|> This is so shockingly creepy. Good riddance to awful rubbish.
7808,<|emo_disgust|> I am too ugly to even wear leggings to work in court.
7809,<|emo_disgust|> He must really hate his job.
7810,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]? I thought he was the most overrated goal post he’s played. Good riddance
7811,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck they are mad
7813,<|emo_disgust|> Otf is wrong with people???
7814,<|emo_disgust|> This sub is literally retarded lol
7817,<|emo_disgust|> That's what I'm worried about!
7818,<|emo_disgust|> We can't be racist against them because they're [RELIGION]!! Nothing like racism to justify our own racism.
7819,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Gentlemen, please do not call our hotel unkind"""
7820,<|emo_disgust|> This is so terrifying.
7821,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is when you do the only thing that is left-wing really want - Israel-bashing.
7822,<|emo_disgust|> Damn. That's awful.
7823,"<|emo_disgust|> Just like me, you are frustrated that no one has ever tried to correct you."
7824,"<|emo_disgust|> Lol, that last one was the absolute worst"
7825,<|emo_disgust|> That's not really news at all. It seems almost bizarre that a major league team would shy away from using him at times.
7826,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn I wanna kill [NAME].
7827,"<|emo_disgust|> My favorite reaction is ""it's not his fault, it was [NAME]"" followed by ""it's not his fault, it was [NAME]"" and ""it wasn't [NAME]"""
7828,<|emo_disgust|> She's a disgusting mooching off the middle class.
7829,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is worse. [NAME] is just as bad, if not worse"
7830,<|emo_disgust|> This made me want to die
7831,<|emo_disgust|> They didn't have any in the original post.
7832,<|emo_disgust|> He didn't take it well actually
7833,"<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit. You were so far off the mark. Go look up ""attempted murder"". You are a weirdo."
7834,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit this sub turned into a fucking Shitpost thread in under a minute.
7835,<|emo_disgust|> It’s a fact that all their videos and photos are fake
7836,"<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating and disgusting. No, seriously. To anyone who isn't the degree that had been posted."
7840,<|emo_disgust|> That's a horrible take.
7841,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, I am a man and my penis is 9 inches long. That's the extent of my penis envy."
7842,<|emo_disgust|> The only positive thing [NAME] has to say so far is that he has a lot less anxiety and depression than I do...
7843,<|emo_disgust|> You look just like me...ott of a stubborn girl
7844,<|emo_disgust|> And they're saying they're not! /s
7845,"<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing is, I thought I knew this...apparently not."
7846,<|emo_disgust|> Soooo guilty.
7847,<|emo_disgust|> Oh I fucking hate [NAME]
7848,<|emo_disgust|> They're worse than the [RELIGION] ones [NAME] and [NAME]
7849,<|emo_disgust|> They would be more awkward to walk in than rush hour traffic by myself haha. Which is what I'd doing if I was driving
7850,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh man, I have no idea what that is. I'm so envious of [NAME]."
7851,"<|emo_disgust|> No, the problem I had was with the title."
7852,<|emo_disgust|> She didn’t even reply. I’m genuinely shocked that someone in her position would let something like that stand in the way for her.
7854,<|emo_disgust|> i feel jealous and jealous to hear such stories
7855,<|emo_disgust|> I did what I had to do dad. I had to report your disgusting behavior to the police. Can't stand looking at your kids.
7856,"<|emo_disgust|> I actually feel kind of bad for it too, I mean we all do these... but then again I have a girlfriend who would say, ""Oops, she was just doing normal shit"". "
7857,<|emo_disgust|> It’s just a joke
7859,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow I’m seeing you lately! You’re really out of line, and you’re doing a disservice to your children. Shame on you"
7861,<|emo_disgust|> Lol the dude just insulted the refs and just wanted to say hi
7862,<|emo_disgust|> How do you get that high from just taking a sip? I'm surprised you've never tried guarana.
7864,<|emo_disgust|> This just reeks of left /s
7865,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fucking scumbag
7866,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] you people are so fucking dumb.
7867,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't mind sex with animals, but if it's anything like my situation, imagine having animal foreplay while having a human partner."
7869,<|emo_disgust|> I want to say that I was distressed. I was not.
7871,<|emo_disgust|> That’s just mean!
7872,<|emo_disgust|> People do these kinds of things in America too. They're the worst of the worst.
7873,<|emo_disgust|> That’s so creepy.
7874,<|emo_disgust|> I don't think the kid shot was even close to that. I mean look at the evidence. The kid was shooting while holding a gun.
7875,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not sure that the law authorizes it. It could be a weird thing to do.
7876,<|emo_disgust|> That was really disgusting
7877,<|emo_disgust|> You're an uneducated twat.
7878,<|emo_disgust|> I’m saying these memes are really bad because all the people saying “oh that’s a [NAME]” are also the same people who think “oh hey that’s a [NAME]”.
7879,"<|emo_disgust|> If he is this bad on the road, he's not playing very good defensively. "
7882,<|emo_disgust|> She said her son was going to kill her and that the older woman was going to kill her the next time anyone tried to come to her house.
7883,"<|emo_disgust|> This is a terrible tip. Please think before doing something that could potentially end horribly for you, while you're at it."
7884,<|emo_disgust|> Well what we know for sure is they got some really weird looks from the crowd at the end. Weird looks indeed.
7888,"<|emo_disgust|> So, you woke up, you know as a person what you have done, and now you regret what you did?"
7889,"<|emo_disgust|> I didn't die, I survived!"
7890,<|emo_disgust|> This is a weird thing to be concerned with.
7891,"<|emo_disgust|> In the words of [NAME], ""the bitch is dead and the bastard is in jail."""
7892,<|emo_disgust|> I am a moron.
7893,<|emo_disgust|> Damn. That was dirty.
7894,<|emo_disgust|> It’s creepy and weird.
7895,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fucking monster
7896,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing that makes any of this any worse is the way you worded it lol.
7897,"<|emo_disgust|> It's creepy how he wrote that, ""and she likes it"". "
7898,"<|emo_disgust|> And the guy that shot the first, but then backed off because of the crowd got into it."
7899,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a pro-west bastard, which doesn't leave a lot of room for interpretation lol."
7900,<|emo_disgust|> You know what your doing? Go back and watch the fight. Not the cringe. You have the right to laugh.
7901,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I don't believe in devil horns. Not to mention the fact that they're actually a terrible thing to horn yourself out with.
7902,<|emo_disgust|> He’s creepy.
7903,"<|emo_disgust|> When one goes into what the hell, that's when the horror really starts."
7904,<|emo_disgust|> Oh my [NAME] I almost forgot about this episode
7905,<|emo_disgust|> Don't know why it offends you.
7907,"<|emo_disgust|> In my community, this is known as the ""YT busting"" community. It's gross, and I hate it."
7908,<|emo_disgust|> People are the worst!
7909,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I didn’t know you could trash talk like that.
7910,<|emo_disgust|> But you're not. You just make up bullshit about everything.
7911,"<|emo_disgust|> I do not care what anyone says, I still LOVE my [NAME]."
7912,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is terrible... He's gotta buy a plane ticket to Florida
7913,<|emo_disgust|> They’re awful at their jobs
7914,"<|emo_disgust|> We can't change minds, but we can change our behaviour."
7915,<|emo_disgust|> You're pathetic for expecting people to care about your pain.
7918,<|emo_disgust|> He said no one was waiting. That's pretty lewd.
7919,"<|emo_disgust|> How dare you leave the couch, dude. Leave your couch..."
7921,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] isn’t a wizard. He’s a deeply troubled child, and has depression and antisemitism. "
7922,<|emo_disgust|> What a waste of metal.
7923,"<|emo_disgust|> What a stupid move, to go for a gun."
7924,<|emo_disgust|> i feel agitated and sad easily
7925,"<|emo_disgust|> No, what you're doing is fucking disgusting."
7926,<|emo_disgust|> And you wonder why they are getting burned more because of weather and roadways. You're ignorant.
7927,<|emo_disgust|> What in the actual fuck. I'm so tired.
7929,<|emo_disgust|> What?
7930,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like im being rebellious in my daily life
7931,<|emo_disgust|> Omg [NAME] youre disgusting
7932,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I hate reddit
7933,"<|emo_disgust|> They’re not angry at you, they’re angry at the people you’re aligning with."
7934,<|emo_disgust|> She's hot af loxia
7935,<|emo_disgust|> This comment and thread make me want to die
7936,<|emo_disgust|> Because it would present a potential choking hazard.
7937,<|emo_disgust|> She could have literally anything she wanted but decided to end up with you. Get over it.
7938,<|emo_disgust|> This story is pure karma and has to be ignored.
7939,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, I really hate [NAME] so much but at least he has decent mechanics...atleast for the most part. "
7941,"<|emo_disgust|> You are disgusting and disgusting people inside and out. I'm so sorry you had to come across that way. You will not always have to deal with this kind of abuse, but you will never have it."
7942,<|emo_disgust|> I know! I'm a horrible human being. This is just a reminder that it's not always that easy to make the switch. ♣
7943,<|emo_disgust|> Don’t forget our fucking defensemen. Fuck off.
7944,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck all you do is whine about something that sucks?
7945,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I'd love a new Garris!
7946,<|emo_disgust|> Now I’m wondering if [NAME] can make himself happy..
7947,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so insulted that i cannot even handle this
7948,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst trade I've ever heard of.
7950,<|emo_disgust|> Wow she’s quite possibly one of the worst talents a human has ever worked with
7951,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling extremely agitated very unhappy and very upset
7952,"<|emo_disgust|> No, the real answer is a lot less glamorous."
7955,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm going to find this comment offensive, stop being a mean girl and stop being a mean boy."
7956,<|emo_disgust|> It’s not even cool to kill people by throwing furniture out of a 14 story window
7957,<|emo_disgust|> >it would leave U.S. citizens vulnerable Thanks! That's actually a terrible idea. Your statement is incorrect.
7958,<|emo_disgust|> He may have told you all but I don't want to swear at a guy by posting this in r/news
7959,<|emo_disgust|> What a sick goal.
7960,<|emo_disgust|> Damn. You’re *not* the only one lol. Thanks for sharing.
7962,<|emo_disgust|> What the hell? How are you reading [NAME]?
7963,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not a fan of Corgis. They're nasty little buggers.
7964,<|emo_disgust|> The worst!! I honestly miss wally he was so likeable
7966,"<|emo_disgust|> What, again? That poor sap"
7969,<|emo_disgust|> Aaaand they got dicked again
7973,<|emo_disgust|> > What the fuck who likes cold More power to you! :)
7974,<|emo_disgust|> That would be raped like *every fucking time* by now.
7976,<|emo_disgust|> What? Are you fucking serious?
7977,<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting. Reminds me of when my mum used to throw rotten food into our face... BING!
7978,"<|emo_disgust|> It would take too long to do that. How would you show your remorse, by going ahead and killing everyone?"
7979,<|emo_disgust|> You don't even get to be wrong once
7980,<|emo_disgust|> This is child abuse. No decent parent would force their kid to starve just because they're hungry.
7981,"<|emo_disgust|> In my opinion, [NAME] is the greatest ever. Probably the whole NHL... anyone disagree?"
7982,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh good lord, we really are terrible at this one. "
7983,"<|emo_disgust|> If there was a way out of my way forgot I was in a shitty relationship, it would just be rude to try now."
7984,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was horrible
7985,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn it Donuts
7986,<|emo_disgust|> Just gotta check your e-mail..so weird i don't even know how to deal with all that!
7987,<|emo_disgust|> I don't drink or do drugs honestly. I'm just a hypocrite and I hate it.
7988,<|emo_disgust|> i remember feeling very disgusted by this
7989,<|emo_disgust|> I feel like [NAME] just blew my mind lol lol
7990,<|emo_disgust|> Who'd do that? I mean yeah that's pretty disgusting.
7992,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] said it best... don’t be a HHH girl
7994,<|emo_disgust|> You're a terrible human being and a worse human being only in your ability to be cruel.
7995,<|emo_disgust|> Lol [NAME] and [NAME] have to suck it in together!
7996,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm with you, pulju has been looking bad lately"
7997,<|emo_disgust|> Why is it racist?
7998,<|emo_disgust|> But it’s still disgusting
8001,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that it's a 3D printed gun isn't really that terrible...
8004,<|emo_disgust|> How scary. People can do horrible things all the time. No one can say you wrote it.
8006,"<|emo_disgust|> You cant make a living off this. Mine takes 2 years to get any, its hell."
8007,<|emo_disgust|> The fuck is “good for”
8008,<|emo_disgust|> What's wrong with this picture
8009,<|emo_disgust|> And he could be a horrible racist
8010,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird thing is, I was having a lot of fun with it, as any longwinded post-apocalyptic quest junkie should."
8011,<|emo_disgust|> This game is so stupid. I'm just sick of these problems
8012,<|emo_disgust|> There's always the risk of them not wanting the ball
8013,<|emo_disgust|> The guy who posted this picture and called himself a [NAME] on his blog is an idiot lol.
8014,"<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting. If someone gets that close to your house, you are at risk."
8015,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] how awful.
8016,"<|emo_disgust|> Shut the fuck up, [NAME]!"
8017,<|emo_disgust|> But it will never look good!
8018,<|emo_disgust|> I have no idea what this sub is about but I love it!
8021,<|emo_disgust|> That’s horrible. Did he really say that? Did he actually say that? Are you sure?
8023,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is disgusting.
8024,<|emo_disgust|> Now that’s crazy
8026,<|emo_disgust|> That video was a little zoomed in on a deer not a person. How disgusting
8029,<|emo_disgust|> How odd. He's quite possibly the worst manager/coach/player I've ever seen.
8030,"<|emo_disgust|> The internet can be a bitch, but it's better than the hated adult world. Take a break from reddit and go straight to Facebook."
8031,<|emo_disgust|> That damn wink slayed me. Fucking bastard.
8033,<|emo_disgust|> The fact he went on to become a Prosecutor and is now a judge is absolutely... weird.
8034,<|emo_disgust|> A very old and very dumb answer.
8035,<|emo_disgust|> What the hell are you talking about?
8036,<|emo_disgust|> Don't go there. That area is full of traps and people who are just really bonkers.
8037,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] it's literally in the fucking nose.
8038,<|emo_disgust|> Not enough!
8039,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] I hate Twitter
8042,<|emo_disgust|> I think I've seen this. In which case it's hilarious.
8043,<|emo_disgust|> It was an absolute shitshow. The manager was absolute shit though
8044,<|emo_disgust|> That was a dirty kick.
8046,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is horrible... Id be really pissed if [NAME] was our general
8047,"<|emo_disgust|> No, it was that. You're a freak. "
8048,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] IS ALL ABOUT THIS
8049,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I need to find more videos of that cat.
8050,<|emo_disgust|> They dont pay shit
8051,<|emo_disgust|> You know who you are. Shut your mouth.
8053,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a [NAME] for being a [NAME] and wanting to run away from home. You’re just disgusting for thinking that.
8054,<|emo_disgust|> Well at least he got a good bashing in the second...
8055,<|emo_disgust|> What in the actual fuck? I’m just going to chill out for now
8057,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I wish I’d seen this damn It was so nice 😍😂🤣
8058,<|emo_disgust|> I'm just being cruel my little friend.
8059,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was bad as a judge, could've easily given [NAME] jail for his part in the entire SCOTUS SC decision. [NAME] in law should be worse."
8060,"<|emo_disgust|> This is horrible, but if I were to get pregnant right now it would probably be through a horrifyingly elaborate infertility scam the way they did with his mother... "
8061,"<|emo_disgust|> That’s awful. I’d gladly part with even more, thanks."
8062,<|emo_disgust|> That's really disgusting. Tell her to go outside and exercise. Lots of exercise.
8063,"<|emo_disgust|> If you ever got on, stop and think for a moment about how hateful you have been made to be by your mother since you were a child. I am sorry..."
8064,<|emo_disgust|> That’s absolutely disgusting. I have no words.
8065,<|emo_disgust|> i am still in the moment of feeling completely selfish
8066,<|emo_disgust|> It’s a very ugly and chanty chanty song
8067,<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell thought he was dead!
8068,<|emo_disgust|> Why is it so hard for this girl to not hate [NAME] as much as the fan base does?
8069,"<|emo_disgust|> Your comment was clearly extremely rude. I can understand saying ""please"" and ""no"" when it comes to pets but not this."
8070,<|emo_disgust|> Damn the Chargers defense played bad in double figures last week too.
8071,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is the silence in the hallways after he's done saying bye.
8072,<|emo_disgust|> That’s so creepy
8073,<|emo_disgust|> You shut your mouth
8075,<|emo_disgust|> And what a terrible list
8076,<|emo_disgust|> That’s a terrible list
8077,<|emo_disgust|> She just needs to die
8078,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh shit! I totally forgot about that episode!!! Geez, episode of theuck with thatNAME!!!"
8079,<|emo_disgust|> Just look at the damn jerseys.
8082,<|emo_disgust|> What a bitch!
8083,<|emo_disgust|> Your opinion is stupid and bigoted.
8084,<|emo_disgust|> People are gonna be mad if [NAME] doesn't get them [NAME]. Better get them now then years down the road.
8085,<|emo_disgust|> What I really want to see is this gif where they actually play hide the cat then. This will give me nightmares for a month.
8086,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird that people like this are getting big pharma soirons.
8087,<|emo_disgust|> I'd rather be mad or give a ticket than get written up for littering and stuff like that
8088,<|emo_disgust|> This is just such a cynical take on the r/tworeddit rules #voteafterpitchoff
8089,<|emo_disgust|> There’s nothing more disgusting than [RELIGION]
8091,<|emo_disgust|> Your comments are disgusting and you should be ashamed of yourself. Stop trolling.
8092,<|emo_disgust|> That's not very comforting.
8093,"<|emo_disgust|> We have an actual sociologist here, [NAME]. This is just pathetic."
8094,<|emo_disgust|> This is so disgusting. The disgusting things she's saying about herself are shocking even to be sharing on social media.
8095,<|emo_disgust|> The real villains are the US and UK 
8096,<|emo_disgust|> That last panel is the grossest thing I've ever seen.
8097,<|emo_disgust|> He should definitely get counseling...it's really gross
8098,<|emo_disgust|> That’s my favorite type of plane.
8099,"<|emo_disgust|> This is so disgusting, and the only compliment I'd pay is he didn't say ""nice try"" **CLEVER** LOL"
8101,"<|emo_disgust|> What's wrong with veganism? I love animals, I hate meat."
8102,<|emo_disgust|> No way! They hated [NAME]!!
8103,<|emo_disgust|> I think it's more about assholes thinking women are just naturally more generous than other species.
8104,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking idiotic title.
8105,"<|emo_disgust|> We're all [NAME] fans, asshole."
8106,<|emo_disgust|> This joke's become so bad I don't even see it anymore
8108,<|emo_disgust|> Oh no more hate mavs fans
8110,<|emo_disgust|> i do however think that after a few of your friends have assured you that you cannot be wrong and what you are really feeling here is just a bit rude and unpleasant
8111,<|emo_disgust|> He must smell terrible when he sweats. I’ve never been this disgusted.
8112,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, which ones are there? I’m from New Britain and it has a bunch of fake ones. "
8115,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]. She needs to be made to not look so cute when theres someone looking at her dumb...
8119,<|emo_disgust|> Worst case scenario this is the best we'll get. Hope he pays the fine.
8120,<|emo_disgust|> It wasnt hard to get my trusty baurus!
8121,"<|emo_disgust|> It was like a movie, but with penguins. penguins are cool all the time "
8123,<|emo_disgust|> And [NAME] is worse
8124,<|emo_disgust|> He doesn't even seem to have any redeeming qualities. He's a buffoon. Just another day in the Life of Brian.
8125,"<|emo_disgust|> No wonder why a lot of us wear our dreadlocks out, even kids can dread them 😔"
8126,<|emo_disgust|> Fuuuuck that is awful
8127,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I don't care much for his music but I've heard enough awful things by him to know to pick up a bit of trash.
8128,<|emo_disgust|> I can get a job teaching in another town? Stop trying to steal from these kids I'd love it.
8129,<|emo_disgust|> What's the fucking point of that meme? It just makesFuckup king look stupid.
8130,<|emo_disgust|> This is horrible. I want my legs to fall off
8131,<|emo_disgust|> Well that sucks....
8132,<|emo_disgust|> It has to be done with someone you aren't going to be with for a whole life
8133,"<|emo_disgust|> You had a son, don't you? Yeah, you're probably a terrible mother. "
8134,<|emo_disgust|> This is ugly.
8135,<|emo_disgust|> She said that the other night and it was hard for me to not just shut up
8136,"<|emo_disgust|> When my mom told [NAME] she had to go to school on January 25th 2019, I felt like screaming."
8137,"<|emo_disgust|> This is a weird question. I actually don’t think about it everyday, I think about all the stuff I’m going to have to say next time "
8138,<|emo_disgust|> i feel irritated that my friend had a very unfortunate car accident with jeremy
8140,<|emo_disgust|> What a nightmare.
8141,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing worse than this is a company that actually benefits. Which is what you're looking for.
8143,<|emo_disgust|> What a bummer. I really hope you get to go. If you decide not to go I can't blame you. If someone does decide not to go you're in their awful spot for doing what the law requires you to do.
8144,<|emo_disgust|> I just find the guy's face hard as hell
8146,"<|emo_disgust|> Worst advice ever. This goes for any relationship, stop it before it sucks."
8147,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a horrible and racist human Being
8148,<|emo_disgust|> I mean the fact they were able to find a worse contract than [NAME] is pretty crazy to be honest
8149,<|emo_disgust|> That dude definitely heard a few times about people snorting 5x the legal limit before even getting behind the wheel.
8150,<|emo_disgust|> I think they're disgusting people.
8151,<|emo_disgust|> This sounds like utter bullshit to me.
8152,"<|emo_disgust|> If this is how [NAME] wants to run his business, what a nightmare."
8153,"<|emo_disgust|> No but if you don't do your research and cherry pick you're pretty pathetic, but enjoy your whiney posts anyways. "
8154,<|emo_disgust|> It’s the worst when it’s something you agree with completely
8155,<|emo_disgust|> i feel absolutely disgusted about her
8156,<|emo_disgust|> That’s bad
8157,<|emo_disgust|> I hate this reply.
8158,<|emo_disgust|> Well shit but I love my dog and neither of them cares
8160,<|emo_disgust|> It’s not a race it’s a game and its up to you to be the clever loser
8161,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was always the worst, he hated the Attention, he hated everyone"
8162,<|emo_disgust|> That was a misstep from their PR. The real issue is they did a poor job reaching out and counseling her.
8164,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn I’d love to be on the show but they dont seem to pick up the phone
8165,<|emo_disgust|> How awful that she killed herself
8166,<|emo_disgust|> i feel more fucked up at the moment than i did yesterday
8168,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, you're right and I hate it."
8169,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I want to see how these two battle it out
8170,<|emo_disgust|> No youre a troll
8171,<|emo_disgust|> It was so weird to me. I think the reason I like it so much is because it wasn't a horror/thriller
8172,<|emo_disgust|> i feel a little envious too
8173,<|emo_disgust|> That’s so disgusting. She didn’t need to say those things. She’s not worthy of our society.
8174,<|emo_disgust|> No it’s just a clever way of saying you hate me
8176,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Fucking hate [NAME]"""
8177,<|emo_disgust|> Why the fuck does this exist
8178,<|emo_disgust|> That’s even worse honestly
8179,<|emo_disgust|> He is just so obnoxious. I hate him so much.
8181,<|emo_disgust|> It actually is. Some Redditors are very weird.
8182,<|emo_disgust|> You could say that. My own opinion is that some people's bodies smell awful while others smell lovely.
8183,<|emo_disgust|> i was feeling some tension from him and was wondering to myself why this hadn t made him angry
8184,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is such a gift for the pctic
8187,<|emo_disgust|> i hate u...
8189,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck [NAME] and [NAME] for continuing to allow them to do this.
8190,<|emo_disgust|> I do not. This is awful.
8191,"<|emo_disgust|> This is so creepy, but so true lol"
8192,<|emo_disgust|> It's a terrible argument and I hate it.
8193,"<|emo_disgust|> I hate [NAME]. I've been a huge fan of his throughout his tenure, but this is just...ugly. "
8194,<|emo_disgust|> He is playing the anthem in the Shriners building while being heckled by a man wearing a dress
8198,<|emo_disgust|> > There's no better way to enforce control than to get people to believe that there's something wrong with them. Get them to believe that there are just bad apples.
8199,<|emo_disgust|> Don't hate the cowgirls
8201,<|emo_disgust|> This kid is a future serial killer.
8202,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] that's awful, good to know he is with an organization that will listen to him."
8203,"<|emo_disgust|> My favorite part is the title text, ""Where'd you get this?"" "
8204,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, this is the worst."
8206,<|emo_disgust|> It's not a stupid question - there are plenty of people who see themselves as such.
8208,<|emo_disgust|> Because you're a moron.
8209,<|emo_disgust|> i dont know i kinda feel dissatisfied
8210,<|emo_disgust|> There in fact are some who are; sadly you're not one of them.
8211,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating. Not to mention it is absolutely accurate. It's just obnoxious.
8212,"<|emo_disgust|> This sucks, now I am sad"
8213,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, “cis white people” people. This is so awful. 🙏🏼"
8215,<|emo_disgust|> Oh I didn’t realize he was intostood a bit.
8216,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is awful, I'm used to it now."
8217,<|emo_disgust|> I hate that I like her so much
8219,<|emo_disgust|> Damn. I wish I went. I'd have walked RIGHT OUT if the bouncers hadn't shoved me.
8220,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like im kind of pathetic
8222,<|emo_disgust|> The last few years were absolutely horrible and a lot of it was because of [NAME] who is no better than [NAME] but he is not a figurehead for many.
8223,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] these refs actually fucking hate us.
8225,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you! >:O
8226,<|emo_disgust|> I'm more worrying about the dude getting his butt kicked by a bear
8228,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, what a fucking idiot lol"
8231,<|emo_disgust|> We are scared.
8232,<|emo_disgust|> i feel that i m being punished by a god for a purpose
8233,<|emo_disgust|> The sad thing is [NAME] aren't the only ones who support [NAME]....
8234,"<|emo_disgust|> Don't worry, the guy opposite you is wearing a tuxedo."
8235,"<|emo_disgust|> >[NAME] should be out for season and we all blame [NAME] Also, can you spot the damn tree?"
8236,"<|emo_disgust|> They’re a bunch of disgusting, greedy animals"
8238,<|emo_disgust|> It's pretty disgusting.
8239,"<|emo_disgust|> Shut the fuck up, loser."
8241,<|emo_disgust|> And it just gets worse....
8242,"<|emo_disgust|> She doesn't, she just has problems seeing past her own limitations. Like what an ass. "
8244,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is on fire!!! YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!
8245,"<|emo_disgust|> What a fuck up, that's the only course of action you have choices on #voteyouout"
8246,<|emo_disgust|> That was a goal worth throwing goals around.
8247,"<|emo_disgust|> This is the saddest thing I've seen today, so sad it's worth telling."
8248,<|emo_disgust|> > But we haven't accepted that either I am being stupid or you are playing dumb if you don't believe a thing [NAME] says.
8249,<|emo_disgust|> Why the fuck is everyone posting pictures of their cats
8250,<|emo_disgust|> In what fucking world is this drawing not bad
8251,<|emo_disgust|> Because it was fake news.
8252,<|emo_disgust|> He's pretty much an anti-Semite.
8253,<|emo_disgust|> I'm an ex-Marine and this put our relationship in shambles.
8254,<|emo_disgust|> Well fuck off.
8256,<|emo_disgust|> Damn! I didn’t even notice he was missing. What a missed opportunity!
8258,"<|emo_disgust|> Aghh, they really went after [NAME] too. I’m so sorry."
8260,"<|emo_disgust|> It's racist, plain and simple."
8261,<|emo_disgust|> Well that's disgusting.
8262,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] just has to die
8263,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm an FX artist, so yes, it is creepy and weird to draw a penis in a cartoon. "
8265,<|emo_disgust|> Thats exactly what im being told. Youre getting a huge bully at school for a 1 year old.
8266,"<|emo_disgust|> In what, no? I see it. Where are your pictures? I'd be creeped out"
8267,"<|emo_disgust|> Not to be snarky, but who’s a fan of [NAME]?"
8268,<|emo_disgust|> This is exactly how much I hate it
8269,<|emo_disgust|> You had a hard time reading. I thought you were a medical doctor so that was a bit unexpected lol.
8270,<|emo_disgust|> He's actually worse than [NAME]
8271,<|emo_disgust|> i feel very dissatisfied
8273,"<|emo_disgust|> It wasn't even funny, it was disgusting. Now I hateate them on the internet."
8274,"<|emo_disgust|> My dad is an ex bodybuilder and although I love him, what he's done to his body over the years is disgusting."
8277,<|emo_disgust|> i feel kinda weird about sharing these pics because i always wanted some for my little buddy
8278,<|emo_disgust|> My parents died when I was 2. Surprising they were watching a show about Vikings.
8280,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is such a monster. I love the game, but god..."
8281,"<|emo_disgust|> When your head touches the dirtiest of graves, it can say that you've done your very best."
8282,<|emo_disgust|> I don’t like being the laughing stock of the world despite being a 21 year old male
8287,<|emo_disgust|> My favorite is [NAME] because she is extremely flattered. It’s just weird to be flattered in comedy. 
8288,<|emo_disgust|> I really hate that.
8289,<|emo_disgust|> > What [NAME] is wrong with you?
8291,<|emo_disgust|> i feel that ive been punished
8292,<|emo_disgust|> No but I'm tired.
8293,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh yeah, there's that in the name"
8294,"<|emo_disgust|> They're disgusting people to be sure, but I find their obsession with appearance very attractive."
8295,"<|emo_disgust|> But anyway, my point was made and I'm tired of being bullied and shamed and threatened just because I'm a woman."
8296,"<|emo_disgust|> It's so disgusting that we continue to provide services to these people. All the while, they continue to burn the homes we repair."
8297,<|emo_disgust|> The only way is if he's a bot. I hated seeing [NAME] get abused.
8298,"<|emo_disgust|> You're a disgusting piece, you dirty dog. "
8299,<|emo_disgust|> I was having a bad dream and was thinking about how much I hated my job. It could have been easily resolved by that point.
8301,<|emo_disgust|> That was a horrible open shot.... how would [NAME] shoot that?
8302,<|emo_disgust|> It feels like everyone is watching [NAME] and [NAME] and you're the weirdo. Just shut the fuck up kid
8304,<|emo_disgust|> What a weird way to think about the world.
8305,<|emo_disgust|> Man I was so worried for [NAME] health that he was only going to play 18 games this year
8307,"<|emo_disgust|> Fuck all that, just concentrate on fucking [NAME] over there "
8308,<|emo_disgust|> What a waste of plastic
8309,<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry. I hope you are doing better. I do know you probably don't have the best relationship advice out there. That's unfortunate.
8310,<|emo_disgust|> People who believe in a creator God are idiots.
8311,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting... Im disgusted that people can think this seriously.
8312,<|emo_disgust|> You are far worse then [NAME] in every single aspect but personally I blame him for not being able to stop the abuse
8313,<|emo_disgust|> It’s so fucked up I hated Newstalk until I joined the Reddit office.
8316,"<|emo_disgust|> No, the third picture is creepy Also, those eyebrows... oh geez."
8317,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing about news is that you're a fucking Springs-northern florida florida guy. Where the real swedes go?!
8318,"<|emo_disgust|> It looks like you might be right. If other women are saying they didn't feel pressured, that could indeed be their problem."
8319,<|emo_disgust|> You just posted the exact same thing but made it worse.
8321,<|emo_disgust|> The only place I can get high is from Reddit. No truck connections outside of that.
8323,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, really see'd ya."
8324,<|emo_disgust|> Well... yeah
8325,<|emo_disgust|> No man is wrong answer as im not a fan of many of their positions but this is a damn good list
8326,"<|emo_disgust|> Just get them all out, that'll fuck them up."
8327,<|emo_disgust|> i see you i feel suspicious
8328,<|emo_disgust|> What. The. Fuck. *Gags*
8329,<|emo_disgust|> Weird that it's not. It's always been a problem when I'm short with girls.
8330,<|emo_disgust|> This makes me so incredibly angry.
8331,<|emo_disgust|> My parents are the worst. I don't have any.
8333,<|emo_disgust|> There are worse things than this.
8334,<|emo_disgust|> How tf is that racist tbh
8335,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, no."
8336,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck off [NAME].
8337,"<|emo_disgust|> No, it's that the original intent of the laws was legalized, and those who opposed them are seen as somehow ""bad"" for supporting them. Why are you outraged? "
8338,<|emo_disgust|> > It is still a fairly new thing (a few years) This is the first time I've ever heard of this before.
8339,"<|emo_disgust|> No, but a lot of people (especially) seem to be quite uneducated. It's probably a combination of both. "
8341,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is getting a bad reputation for this...
8342,"<|emo_disgust|> I always found the idea of an elaborate disguise weird, but I liked the idea of her mask. "
8343,"<|emo_disgust|> Fuck [NAME] even does that, look at him, knees up, looks rough as fuck"
8344,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I miss mass Rez her new ult is horrendous
8345,<|emo_disgust|> Don't ask stupid questions like that
8346,<|emo_disgust|> Lol what a weird way to ask a question about self defense. I guess it’s OK. I’m just curious.
8347,"<|emo_disgust|> She can't do this to you, [NAME] "
8348,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has a horrible personality
8350,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, no matter how hard I try...I won’t ever change someone’s mind about having that relationship. "
8351,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh you mean ""Hockeytown Sounds"" I'm so sorry."
8353,<|emo_disgust|> That is incredibly uncomfortable to look at.
8354,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst I've ever seen
8355,<|emo_disgust|> There's no saying not to try it!! A little goes a long way. I think it's the absolute must have on any vegan beer or vegan pizza.
8357,"<|emo_disgust|> How about instead of them feeling slightly offended just knowing that a black man was president, and didn't even get to be sworn in until recently."
8358,<|emo_disgust|> We’re all just awful if we’re looking at it through a stupid lens
8359,<|emo_disgust|> That's the worst urinal ever.
8360,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm more than sure we were all aware that this was a possibility when it came out. If you're the one who thinks that, cool, but I'm glad you got your ass kicked. "
8361,<|emo_disgust|> I hate saying this but [NAME] is a joke.
8362,<|emo_disgust|> Those who doubt climate change: look at this.
8365,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] a bitch...get him.
8366,<|emo_disgust|> In my experience they are also awful with women.
8368,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like i should be the most hateful and racist person but i want to stay true to myself and be true to myself but if i talk about racist stuff with anyone then im done
8369,<|emo_disgust|> i feel jealous when the woman i love has all of these things+ more money than us
8372,<|emo_disgust|> I know people are making fun of you for trying and the fact it went well for you speaks volumes for how awful the game is
8373,<|emo_disgust|> Don't listen to the idiot who wants [NAME] back. He can't stand the truth 😂
8374,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck you I’m driving
8375,<|emo_disgust|> But why do some people have them even worse than others?
8376,<|emo_disgust|> The fuck is wrong with Canada?
8377,<|emo_disgust|> Who gives a shit. Stay in your fucking car. We live in South Central LA and that station closest to you is a fucking mess
8378,<|emo_disgust|> People’s hatred of sin is so overwhelming you’ll be shocked to know that only 0.05% of people are saved.
8379,<|emo_disgust|> i feel angry a lot of the time
8380,"<|emo_disgust|> This sucks. Hope you have a great day, tomorrow. "
8381,<|emo_disgust|> Wow they really are all a pack of liers!
8382,<|emo_disgust|> This is why we have divorcees. It’s so frustrating.
8383,<|emo_disgust|> The weird eyes.
8384,<|emo_disgust|> Just like the worst movie jacket I've ever seen
8385,<|emo_disgust|> It was a horrible open shot....
8387,"<|emo_disgust|> If any are left I'll be sending them to you - but only in person, if possible. "
8388,"<|emo_disgust|> Those are the worst ever, by far."
8389,<|emo_disgust|> That last one is real bloodying.
8390,<|emo_disgust|> So much bullshit from [NAME]
8394,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, this looks damn good"
8395,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is actually worse than [NAME]. [NAME] I think the guy is actually worse for the environment than both of them.
8396,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a disgusting liberal democrat.
8397,<|emo_disgust|> Lol what a fuckin n
8398,<|emo_disgust|> I didn't realize the US was the only ones that charged customers by the ton.
8399,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm from Jersey, and you know, Jersey cares a lot about itself and its image."
8400,<|emo_disgust|> People can't be expected to have two jobs... you just have to make them feel insecure and entitled
8401,<|emo_disgust|> It’s a fucking bannable offense. The guy is literally a child.
8402,"<|emo_disgust|> No, the weird stuff is the real deal"
8404,<|emo_disgust|> She definitely needs to stop giving advice to new people. Some people just think they know what is best for their situation and are very self centered.
8405,<|emo_disgust|> Why is this still not fine
8406,"<|emo_disgust|> And they're right! There's even a poll that asks if it's a ""morbid orgy"""
8407,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] can’t be this bad he’s gotta be getting better
8411,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is worse
8412,<|emo_disgust|> Your wife is disgusting. You should divorce her and keep her distance.
8413,<|emo_disgust|> Omg [NAME] i hate Twitter
8415,"<|emo_disgust|> Who gives a shit, it's almost over already."
8416,<|emo_disgust|> She did say you'd get the better offer at a later date. Not gonna lie. That's pretty frustrating.
8417,"<|emo_disgust|> How about we get rid of the words ""morons"" and ""pedophiles"" for good?"
8418,"<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing that is to come out of the mouths of [NAME] is ""I told you so"""
8419,<|emo_disgust|> But it's not: it's a bad joke.
8422,<|emo_disgust|> You seem awful.
8423,<|emo_disgust|> She was an absolute chad
8424,"<|emo_disgust|> That's terrible. I'm so sorry you had that experience, it's awful to hear about that."
8426,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] isn't bad, but he seems to have a bad habit of using a lot of generic sentences and there's way more wrong with him than right..."
8427,<|emo_disgust|> People are animals..
8429,<|emo_disgust|> This shirt is directly aimed at some very ugly individuals
8430,<|emo_disgust|> He was also wrong about everyone but himself
8431,<|emo_disgust|> I think it could be worse. A lot of people are going to be scared off doing this.
8432,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is bad, badly, bad. I’m so sorry [NAME] has to deal with this."
8434,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn do I hate [NAME].
8436,"<|emo_disgust|> They're also on their second job, so don't expect much in return. "
8437,"<|emo_disgust|> Fearing for his life, the Queen Mother sets out on a dangerous journey to find answers for her children."
8438,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm kinda just a student, so I don't really have hands. but...I could crush him..."
8440,"<|emo_disgust|> No no, [NAME] the one that died also had a son that died"
8441,"<|emo_disgust|> No, because you're not getting any women at all."
8442,"<|emo_disgust|> Fuck you, I live in Nashville"
8443,<|emo_disgust|> That's just disgusting.
8444,<|emo_disgust|> And people still don't trust her.
8445,<|emo_disgust|> Why would you doubt it? He’s a moron.
8446,"<|emo_disgust|> That's worse, she might actually die from it"
8447,<|emo_disgust|> Thats pretty lewd.
8448,<|emo_disgust|> I don’t believe in the virgin birth at all.
8449,<|emo_disgust|> > Not at all. The [NAME] issue is fascinating
8450,<|emo_disgust|> i was feeling so disgusted with myself
8451,"<|emo_disgust|> He was talking to the security guard and it took him 10 seconds to reply before he was shot in the head, the witness said"
8452,<|emo_disgust|> But we love the game because we can.
8453,"<|emo_disgust|> No, just go around him and smile and wave! Tell him that there are good people out there who won't let that happen to them."
8454,<|emo_disgust|> i dont feel tortured anymore
8455,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] can’t get downfield
8456,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds awful. I'm so sorry. Can't imagine thinking that's even slightly okay.
8458,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you call [NAME] beautiful!
8459,<|emo_disgust|> That's horrible... :(
8460,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck off. Stay in your fucking car and get out.
8462,"<|emo_disgust|> So what you're saying is that [NAME] and [NAME] aren't ""bad"" is rather absurd."
8463,<|emo_disgust|> I'm just going to have to agree with you. A creepy redhead with a weird name has made me the most Unhappy of people in the light of day.
8464,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Fucking realtors, fuck our foreclosure crisis"""
8466,<|emo_disgust|> This is a really horrible idea. Some people would probably like this more if the nouns were slightly more generic.
8467,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, the way I got my hands on a 40oz bottle of absinthe definitely reminded me of that..."
8468,<|emo_disgust|> I’ve never been in a place I thought I was going to die. This is actually terrifying.
8469,"<|emo_disgust|> If you're looking for the truth, you can read it here."
8471,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah you should have said it wasnt all in your head I personally had 4 bad episodes last weeks which made me think back to episodes i did as a kid
8472,<|emo_disgust|> And also the 2ndhand worry that she will kill herself in the first Tragedy.
8473,<|emo_disgust|> The only good porn I've seen on this sub are the junkrat-rated ones.
8475,<|emo_disgust|> And that shirt is unlined.
8476,<|emo_disgust|> Holy fuck that was fucking bad...
8478,<|emo_disgust|> It just feels weird to have lines like that.
8481,<|emo_disgust|> i feel offended and hurt by them
8482,<|emo_disgust|> Oh it would assuredly ruin her looks and make her seem older.
8483,<|emo_disgust|> I know a couple friends who have had it done. It's a horrible process and I've had it done multiple times.
8484,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] please no I'm so sorry
8487,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] isn't even an [NAME]. I'm fucking shitting myself.
8488,<|emo_disgust|> That's the worst thing I've ever seen.
8489,<|emo_disgust|> We are in a war and we are winning
8490,<|emo_disgust|> Wow! I'd give anything to be able to take her out for a fly
8491,<|emo_disgust|> It's a shame because he is probably the best pure checking power forward in the NHL.
8492,"<|emo_disgust|> He'll probably try to say that to you when he looks you in the face, that you did this to him."
8494,<|emo_disgust|> Those are the only two acceptable insults to a woman. The third one is extra gross.
8495,<|emo_disgust|> She probably thought she was getting rape and death threats too. She was probably just a little too paranoid though.
8496,<|emo_disgust|> Because they are stupid. How many of them would come clean to you if you weren't looking?
8497,"<|emo_disgust|> This is my favorite scene from director [NAME]. As a matter of fact, this is the scene I took the biggest breath and the biggest swallow "
8498,<|emo_disgust|> I can see how that would be a problem. But that’s what happened in my state.
8499,<|emo_disgust|> I fucking hate that I like you
8500,<|emo_disgust|> I’m surprised they couldn’t get a dog-shaped penis out of a straw.
8501,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow that's not very forthright, is it?"
8502,<|emo_disgust|> And why are you a horrible person? Because some people can't be bothered to properly think through and understand any of the above...
8503,<|emo_disgust|> I've always wondered why people on Reddit make fun of [NAME]. Probably because they're so used to hearing bad nicknames on the radio and internet.
8504,<|emo_disgust|> But it just feels so weird that its even bigger problem
8505,<|emo_disgust|> The guy who works in TSA concierge lines is such an asshole.
8508,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah you are a disgusting piece of filth. I hope the state puts you in the Correct category.
8509,"<|emo_disgust|> I know, I know, it's been done before, it's called ""giving in"" and it's terrible and all, but the point still stands 😍"
8510,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird because I do this
8511,"<|emo_disgust|> I mean it’s really strange how many people think this about themselves, probably because it’s not really something they’re concerned about"
8512,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating that it's ridiculous that this is still happening.
8513,<|emo_disgust|> What a disgusting pack of dirty animals these people are.
8515,<|emo_disgust|> Holy fuckkkkk I’m still supporting him! You’re literally nothing to him! Your only argument is disgusting
8517,"<|emo_disgust|> This one was really, really painful to watch. Even worse than the ending. Thank you so much for making it worth it."
8518,<|emo_disgust|> That's a rather large wash.
8519,"<|emo_disgust|> No one will actually see you. Just a flag with the words, ""No One Is Going to See My Flag"" emblazoned on it. Idiots."
8520,"<|emo_disgust|> Worst case scenario scenario, they are going to have an embarrassing evening."
8521,<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry but aren't you just a tad bit weird
8522,<|emo_disgust|> People get very upset when you call a 9-5 worker a cunt.
8523,<|emo_disgust|> That head must hurt!
8524,<|emo_disgust|> Lol I was thinking that. Is your story about you?
8525,<|emo_disgust|> I think it should be illegal to give advice about cars to anyone. There's no need for it.
8526,<|emo_disgust|> He's going to hate you
8527,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has played like garbage all season and deserves his spot.
8528,<|emo_disgust|> Not to be a [NAME] we've had such a terrible record against the breakaways in the past so this is not really news to me.
8530,<|emo_disgust|> So many people tell me I look cute when I'm wrong
8532,<|emo_disgust|> I'm here for the [NAME] story. I want the real thing!
8533,<|emo_disgust|> When it rained outside I got nightmares
8534,<|emo_disgust|> > This is weird Because he's attractive
8535,"<|emo_disgust|> In the 4th qtr of this year, it was a fucking monster. 25.3% owned, and only 1/3rd were above rated. Fuck off"
8536,<|emo_disgust|> We are so fucking stupid
8537,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a FUCKYATTEMOO
8538,<|emo_disgust|> It really is... it can't believe people actually call their own phones that
8540,"<|emo_disgust|> He is also the proud owner of one of the worst media personalities ever, A complete idiot."
8542,"<|emo_disgust|> ""You didn't support his wife's health, that’s why you’re here! Go fuck yourself!"""
8543,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] how awful
8544,<|emo_disgust|> That's quite a lot worse tbh
8545,<|emo_disgust|> They’re so excited. I’m so nervous too. But they’re so excited. I’m so nervous I’m going to boom
8546,<|emo_disgust|> That was more than a fucking slap on the face
8547,<|emo_disgust|> That’s wild
8548,<|emo_disgust|> i honestly feel kind of petty
8549,<|emo_disgust|> That looks awful.
8551,<|emo_disgust|> Because they arent thinking through the big picture properly?
8552,<|emo_disgust|> A shitpost in response to [NAME]. Not an insult at all.
8554,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]? Where the fuck are their fucking rainbows?!
8555,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh it's not just ""Oh it's a bug"" it's ""IT'S BEEN BURNED INTO A BEAR""."
8556,"<|emo_disgust|> Holy crap, I'm so sorry, that was absolutely horrible."
8557,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting. One looks like makeup and the other looks like they just happened to have makeup on.
8558,<|emo_disgust|> What a disgusting thread.
8559,<|emo_disgust|> I would of walked right out. Not shocked to hear that. Fuck off.
8560,<|emo_disgust|> A shitpost in which case you should lose your shit and go cry your little life away
8561,<|emo_disgust|> He must smell terrible in there...
8564,<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting. I'm so sorry for your loss. Lots to learn from this. Keep in touch w ❤️
8565,<|emo_disgust|> My friends are starting to think I'm a [RELIGION] freak...
8566,<|emo_disgust|> She has been caught in multiple incidents of official state security agents arresting peaceful peaceful anti-fascists. It's disturbing.
8567,<|emo_disgust|> The thing is that I do enjoy drinking.
8568,"<|emo_disgust|> This is some of the scariest, most disturbing shit I've seen on here lately. I hope you have a wonderful day. <3"
8569,<|emo_disgust|> This thread is a good indication that Reddit can get a little crazy :p
8570,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I’m afraid here.
8571,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, I've also found out that once I make a ""I hate it"" choice, it is almost never because I'm too dumb to realize I made a wrong choice."
8572,"<|emo_disgust|> Those are deep pockets! I'm with you, deep pockets are a terrible idea."
8573,<|emo_disgust|> I'll take it up to thelordbspawrgh and pray he enforces his laws upon us all!
8574,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking [NAME] I feel your pain...
8576,<|emo_disgust|> i don t feel like i should be bothered
8577,<|emo_disgust|> He should go to HELL
8578,<|emo_disgust|> This is child abuse. No decent parent would force a kid to starve just because they don't understand science and nutrition
8580,<|emo_disgust|> My husband doesn't like it. He thinks it's gross. 😂
8581,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn what a comeback.
8582,<|emo_disgust|> She wants to be an ocean nympho. That's weird as fuck.
8583,<|emo_disgust|> i feel wronged but i don t want to be bothered
8585,<|emo_disgust|> It's a horrible thing to say.
8586,<|emo_disgust|> i love the feelings of anger he has and the hurt and disgust im seeing
8587,"<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting to hear, doesn't it? It's worse than if she said, 'I love you too'"
8588,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was horribly inconsistent this year, I’d be shocked for much of the year."
8589,<|emo_disgust|> i feel all frustrated and sad all the time
8591,<|emo_disgust|> This is a horrible meme
8592,<|emo_disgust|> Damn it..
8593,<|emo_disgust|> How tf does it not feel shitty to suck on a sieve?
8594,<|emo_disgust|> I still need an airhorn though! It's been like 4 years but I've only had it for 5 years now. :(
8595,<|emo_disgust|> I mean *protesting* the invader from the inside out is a pretty crazy thing to do.
8597,<|emo_disgust|> The most unwelcome of coments
8598,<|emo_disgust|> That’s wild I’m so sorry
8600,<|emo_disgust|> >The fact that it was uploaded to the internet and the author didn't take it well is pretty telling tbh...
8601,<|emo_disgust|> There also been multiple times they have stated his body is not recoverable after he went days without food.
8602,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst Twitter account I've ever seen.
8603,<|emo_disgust|> So obnoxious. 🤷🤷🤷
8604,<|emo_disgust|> I’m a college student who is supporting her parents and has zero support system.
8605,<|emo_disgust|> My wife is out for my birthday and we don’t want her home to be where I want her to be.
8607,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was right to pick up the phone. No need to blame the US
8608,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch! Dried fruits and veggies on pizza sounds terrible
8609,<|emo_disgust|> Those people are the worst ever.
8611,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking weird thing people do.
8612,<|emo_disgust|> It just feels so weird to be a girl.
8613,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I would like to see them fail since I've seen them fail on every single occasion.
8614,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit I didn't realize there were no “schools” in the U.S. You've been mouthful.
8615,<|emo_disgust|> No you don't. You support the left for what? [NAME].
8616,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, your parents are awful 🤣"
8617,<|emo_disgust|> That’s just awful. I’m so sorry that is what it is.
8618,<|emo_disgust|> This is awful. Could the government shutdown have gone any worse?
8619,"<|emo_disgust|> This is a really good point, thank you. I don't think the article is terribly bad, just need more of a voice from you."
8620,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm really glad it was a boy, that's awful."
8621,<|emo_disgust|> Weird way to spellax. Means he has weird glasses.
8622,<|emo_disgust|> i didn t feel rushed to get into the classroom
8623,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] I hate them so much.
8627,<|emo_disgust|> I wouldnt be as envious since it's a bit weird to see someone you care about but not be jealous either lol.
8628,<|emo_disgust|> I miss the north hills bottom dollar
8630,<|emo_disgust|> I hate people like this
8632,<|emo_disgust|> He was a very bad defender. The ball never got past him.
8634,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking thot*
8635,<|emo_disgust|> Oh yep. They don't want to pay for it.
8636,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, [NAME] knows how to handle a situation like that. Good thing he is a cop."
8637,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is the most useless phantom thief change my mind?
8638,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst possible outcome
8639,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, I hate everything about this"
8640,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you ask a child to swear off their religion for a field trip to engas gas station! FFS!
8642,<|emo_disgust|> I’ve never seen such hate in my life
8644,<|emo_disgust|> My eyes are watery so I can't tell the difference between syrup and water but a few times I swear this is syrup.
8645,<|emo_disgust|> I can’t get off to this.
8647,<|emo_disgust|> How many women do you know who have had an experience where they went from wanting to have a sex change to wanting to be a man.
8648,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling a bit angry
8650,"<|emo_disgust|> It's more of a culture thing. When invective is coming from a woman, it's an insult. "
8651,<|emo_disgust|> i went to school feeling pretty terrible at my spelling and grammar in high school and when i started university i thought to myself that these were the skills i needed
8652,<|emo_disgust|> And if they're under 19 you're guilty until proven innocent.
8653,<|emo_disgust|> My daughter told me she hates me
8654,"<|emo_disgust|> The most telling sign is the fact that they think Reddit is a ""gigantic cesspool""."
8655,<|emo_disgust|> I've got a feeling we are going to be getting a reworked version of this next year.
8656,<|emo_disgust|> The one near my house is getting destroyed by coyotes.
8658,<|emo_disgust|> I’m not the same anymore. I’m devastated.
8659,<|emo_disgust|> I'm just sick of reading about it and not caring.
8660,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah the racist and sexist underpinnings are there, it's just that the message iswashed."
8661,<|emo_disgust|> Because all the above-mentioned people are so fucking stupid
8662,<|emo_disgust|> When will you ever get enough internet to actually comment?
8663,<|emo_disgust|> What a creepy-looking girl
8665,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not a [NAME] and I don't like either of them. You will have to use your own judgement though.
8667,<|emo_disgust|> The guy just posted a video of himself hitting a light pole. He’s definitely a weirdo.
8668,<|emo_disgust|> It's so creepy. Good riddance to awful rubbish that few people are even aware of.
8670,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is getting ready to pop the question
8671,<|emo_disgust|> i feel extremely disgusted that i d have to say that
8674,"<|emo_disgust|> I was about to say this about this.. But dude, I'd be livid if I wasn't living in New Mexico!!!!!!!!!"
8675,<|emo_disgust|> Weird ways to spell [RELIGION].
8676,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck off. Don’t waste your time.
8677,<|emo_disgust|> It's all very well to say something like “I hate Britain” but it has a much smaller chance of being said than it does of being said while wearing your cosplaying costume.
8678,<|emo_disgust|> You really don't like her do you?
8679,<|emo_disgust|> i woke up feeling a bit resentful because i was up all night to do this for no other reason than i was tired of being in the loop
8680,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that’s a big F from me.
8681,<|emo_disgust|> This is just the worst year of my life
8682,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I had no idea that you had a tattoo of a penis across your chest"" is pretty creepy. "
8683,<|emo_disgust|> Fuuuuuuuck. I just read that. What the hell is this going to do to my confidence? I'm good at expressing myself I swear
8684,<|emo_disgust|> Not one single one mention of [NAME] and [NAME] is anything but awful.
8685,"<|emo_disgust|> The weird thing is, most of these are college kids. Who went to school and doesn't look 30."
8686,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] should be FIRED. This is the kind of play that gets teams into the playoffs.
8687,<|emo_disgust|> In an attempt to be less offensive. That's not an insult. She knew what she was talking about.
8689,<|emo_disgust|> i know how you feel i didnt want to go down that road myself but now i feel like i can be wrong
8690,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating. Why is this allowed to be taken seriously?
8692,"<|emo_disgust|> I can't tell you that, it's honestly the saddest thing I've heard all day "
8693,<|emo_disgust|> Now you're saying it's a bad thing to say about someone. Get off the internet.
8694,<|emo_disgust|> That's creepy and weird. Good riddance to awful rubbish.
8695,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, you’re very indecisive."
8696,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm gonna hit those walls until they crush that shitty smug bastard, good lord."
8697,"<|emo_disgust|> I see a lot of these these ""outsider"" comments on Reddit. You're doing something right. them."
8698,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] fucked that up.
8702,<|emo_disgust|> They're too busy writing shitty op ed's about how everyone else is bad to worry about how they will react (i.e. actual fools who actually want to be called out on their bullshit).
8703,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I really miss being little"""
8706,<|emo_disgust|> That's so disgusted with the level of education these people have.
8707,<|emo_disgust|> This is me all the time!
8709,<|emo_disgust|> Well we didn't just beat them they also beat us in the super bowl so we're pretty favorites
8710,<|emo_disgust|> >[NAME] that is just mindblowing. a relationship in which she physically hurts you with her words and actions? No way you are in any way emotionally invested
8711,<|emo_disgust|> Fuuuuck these refs are terrible
8712,<|emo_disgust|> I know so many people here hate reddit. I wish I could be one of them!
8713,<|emo_disgust|> The problem is we don't pay taxes to fund these things and I hate when that's the case
8714,<|emo_disgust|> He’s a complete ham sandwich with a turd inside
8715,<|emo_disgust|> Wow what a bully.
8716,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah how dare they ask [NAME] to be ""neutral"" on a debate stage wtf. Get him off the stage before it's too late"
8719,"<|emo_disgust|> I have a feeling everyone will regret this, and that will be a terrible thing for karma to bear"
8720,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, those cookies are terrible. Good thing I have a giant ol' bowl of cereal to keep me warm in summer. "
8721,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is trash as hell but [NAME] is on fire!!!
8722,<|emo_disgust|> I wish this was a real thing but its probably far less common than you think.
8724,<|emo_disgust|> I can’t listen to that anymore
8725,<|emo_disgust|> I still can't believe this team beat Winnipeg last week. Not to mention we gave up 2 goals against. That wasn't good
8726,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is way cuter for her parents.
8727,"<|emo_disgust|> The weird way I wrote ""tucson"" made me think of somewhere far away, Arizona."
8729,<|emo_disgust|> This is the stupidest thing I've seen on Reddit today. Thanks for the gold!
8730,<|emo_disgust|> That is truly disgusting.
8731,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. What about emotional support? Are they only available online?
8732,<|emo_disgust|> That's a Shame He was young and healthy when he died.
8733,"<|emo_disgust|> No deal is close, then. What do I do now?"
8734,<|emo_disgust|> i feel less stressed and i feel much more thankful for everything which i could be losing and being a part of
8735,<|emo_disgust|> This is so painfully 80s. I loved it at the time but it's just...old.
8737,<|emo_disgust|> I’m not even sure what that is other than the fact that we already know [NAME] used online dating to meet women.
8740,<|emo_disgust|> This is the kind of stuff that makes me want to go back in time and kill all of those presenters and presenters themselves
8741,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I'm sorry for your loss. Stay optimistic.
8742,<|emo_disgust|> And it only gets worse from there
8743,<|emo_disgust|> But it is so expensive to live in Europe lol
8744,<|emo_disgust|> I hate those days man... So triggering
8745,"<|emo_disgust|> No, that’s not a fucking picture of a penis. She’s a representation of [NAME]."
8746,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck those creeps
8747,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I have trust issues.
8748,"<|emo_disgust|> Your just fine being a stoner kid and not being a regular anymore, thanks"
8749,<|emo_disgust|> It’s so weird. I’m 50 and I’m normal weight. Same with me
8750,<|emo_disgust|> You and your supporters should be ashamed
8751,"<|emo_disgust|> [RELIGION] is [RELIGION] if you're a woman and a man. I feel you, I'm no longer in the dark."
8752,<|emo_disgust|> You don't get paid extra to not use our bathrooms or locker rooms
8753,<|emo_disgust|> This is creepy and weird. Good riddance to awful rubbish.
8754,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, the media is finally waking up to the extent that it treats repeat offenders rather than offenders who are repeat offenders."
8755,<|emo_disgust|> O.o fuck off.
8756,<|emo_disgust|> That was disgusting. VWP
8757,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a very good shot-blocker but he also struggles at the rim.
8758,<|emo_disgust|> Who ever said politics was stupid. It's all bollocks.
8759,<|emo_disgust|> I thought this was a picture of [NAME] with the headline about how he plans to stop receiving the [NAME] award if he doesn’t vote for [NAME]
8760,<|emo_disgust|> I have been beaten up by my brother
8762,<|emo_disgust|> I feel bad for the state but a lot of these places would be ruinously expensive to live in.
8763,<|emo_disgust|> He said i am very rude to him and makes him feel unimportant while playing video games
8764,<|emo_disgust|> This is my 2nd time posting this. It is getting a little out of hand.
8765,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, look at that spine real good"
8766,<|emo_disgust|> What a disgusting person she is...
8767,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, it would still be a terrible deal for the environment. A lot of that would come from the oil companies."
8769,<|emo_disgust|> That's rude nsfw.
8770,<|emo_disgust|> I do sometimes. But it’s especially likely after watching [NAME] play. He's really bad.
8771,<|emo_disgust|> This picture is garbage. Can't look at it.
8772,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking love that song.
8773,<|emo_disgust|> And now you're whining about how the new maps are terrible now that old ones are the truth....
8774,"<|emo_disgust|> What? Why will you even listen to advice, you fucking idiotic troll."
8775,<|emo_disgust|> I guess we could all agree there is definitely something wrong with this guy. :(
8776,<|emo_disgust|> i didnt even feel jealous
8777,<|emo_disgust|> Man I hate [NAME]
8779,<|emo_disgust|> He will get abused at every turn. This is the reality of being president.
8780,"<|emo_disgust|> Shut up, [RELIGION]!"
8781,<|emo_disgust|> Oh so you're saying you're a racist?
8782,"<|emo_disgust|> My parents are going to the store to get their milk because it's almost ready, they made the wrong choice of goat cheese."
8783,<|emo_disgust|> I know its bullshit but seriously. I was at work today and was very irritated at the waste of time at work. I do it all the time. All the people on my division have a net worth of over $ Million.
8784,<|emo_disgust|> Weird. But I think it'll be worth it.
8785,"<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit, talk about crazy"
8786,"<|emo_disgust|> No thanks, I've found a better way."
8787,<|emo_disgust|> I've been to six funerals and five cemeteries. I've never seen that number of casketards. It's just... Wow.
8788,<|emo_disgust|> I still hate them
8789,<|emo_disgust|> He's going to look even worse than his current self next time out.
8790,<|emo_disgust|> My mom's a nurse and I feel your pain. I'm so sorry you're going through all of this.
8791,"<|emo_disgust|> I love me some DnD, but not this much."
8794,"<|emo_disgust|> That’s the exact scenario I was describing, when I was young and ashamed of who I was"
8795,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was a terrible defender, but I have a hard time understanding why he was a top 5 pick."
8796,<|emo_disgust|> How the hell do I un-ring the bell?!
8797,<|emo_disgust|> Why the fuck do you think all that shit isbelt metal?
8798,<|emo_disgust|> Because you're a stupid fucking dipshit trying to be a man
8799,<|emo_disgust|> How is it racist? Do you have a source?
8801,<|emo_disgust|> I think the same guy that cheered for the attacks on 9/11 is probably a bin Laden supporter now.
8802,<|emo_disgust|> If you are saying you're a child then stop being so callous towards your little ones.
8803,<|emo_disgust|> What a stupid idea.
8804,<|emo_disgust|> i also feel like i am pretty hated on here since the last update
8805,<|emo_disgust|> She has been around for over 70 years! What a useless old.
8806,<|emo_disgust|> You took a terrible risk - big shame
8808,<|emo_disgust|> Now when you insult my mother's looks I get really aggravated and yell at you.
8809,<|emo_disgust|> The irony is that we're seeing an arms race inside Syria in terms of donor. donor flowing into Syria through Turkey as much as possible..
8810,<|emo_disgust|> Oh shit that poor janitor. I thought that was good for a laugh.
8811,<|emo_disgust|> They’re really just saying “it’s “a dog” to keep their jobs. You’re fucking stupid
8812,<|emo_disgust|> I hate when that happens...
8813,<|emo_disgust|> I’ll let the video play while I try to pretend to be upset.
8814,<|emo_disgust|> This is awful... Damn I want to die
8815,<|emo_disgust|> So very cute!
8816,<|emo_disgust|> I love those possum dives!
8817,<|emo_disgust|> We will take it further please
8818,<|emo_disgust|> You forgot about that epic battle...
8819,<|emo_disgust|> You're an awful troll...
8820,<|emo_disgust|> That was an inaccurate and dangerous shot
8821,<|emo_disgust|> Because it makes people less intelligent.
8822,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, we got our ass kicked in the regular season this year. I'm glad [NAME] is back and will help us against the warriors next year. "
8823,<|emo_disgust|> Damn how do you moan tho
8824,<|emo_disgust|> Omg yes!!!
8826,<|emo_disgust|> Don't do /r/YouthRage against your dad. He’s a fucking monster.
8827,<|emo_disgust|> I still feel like I have a long way to go before being good at something like photography. What do you mean?
8828,"<|emo_disgust|> When those [NAME] come out they scream ""We hate all foreigners"""
8829,<|emo_disgust|> Who’s in their right mind thinking these are normal posts?
8830,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, he took too much of his time. I can’t imagine having a productive relationship once he’s done with it."
8831,"<|emo_disgust|> Who said the word ""happiness"" until it came out as a synonym for misery? That was before she took the stage for “poster boy for everything evil”."
8832,<|emo_disgust|> No. Not the one I'm talking about. The one with her legs spread wide like that over the sink
8833,<|emo_disgust|> It looks like something straight out of a horror movie.
8834,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh I don’t know what that is, is gross"
8835,<|emo_disgust|> Damn the calls were terrible.
8836,"<|emo_disgust|> If you think that's what the articles are saying about her, you've never seen anything quite like this."
8837,<|emo_disgust|> Those comments are absolutely disgusting. Reminds me of disgusting comments I read online
8843,<|emo_disgust|> This is scary to know that you went through. People like this can't just get out of this.
8844,<|emo_disgust|> It is absolutely disgusting that our government has yet to deal with this
8845,<|emo_disgust|> Who’s fcking a cow
8846,<|emo_disgust|> Why everyone is saying this makes me want to die
8847,<|emo_disgust|> That’s a really dumb thing to say. How dumb are you socially?
8848,<|emo_disgust|> This is actually pretty disgusting. The woman was also using her 5th sense to tell the guy to stop.
8849,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I'm a [NAME]!"" Kills."
8850,<|emo_disgust|> Why did you stop caring about people? Stop caring what other people think stop caring about yourself.
8851,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was an incredibly dumbass for trusting him last time
8852,"<|emo_disgust|> He's not actually a racist, he just has a bad attitude and is racist not because he's racist, he's just bad at racism"
8853,<|emo_disgust|> No. Not the truth at all.
8854,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing that makes this video cringe is people sharing it.
8856,<|emo_disgust|> I love how they are SHOUTING while the dude is giving the finger.
8857,<|emo_disgust|> Lol I get it now. Thanks. I hate reddit.
8858,<|emo_disgust|> And he wouldn't give it to you. He hates accepting gifts.
8860,"<|emo_disgust|> This guy could have easily written the ""it's not my fault it's your wife's"" hate part. It's his wife that's the problem, not you!"
8864,<|emo_disgust|> I hated the Celtics until I started following barstool.
8865,"<|emo_disgust|> Lol no one can take that away from her, or even bothers to ask. She literally just wants to tell you she loves you. Just tell her."
8866,"<|emo_disgust|> You’re pretty toxic, I don’t have time for this shit."
8867,<|emo_disgust|> > I hate it too I'm just a guy
8868,<|emo_disgust|> It would be weird to use [NAME] to load a scene.
8869,"<|emo_disgust|> Just be glad he didn't accidentally shoot the guy that was following him, for karma's sake."
8870,<|emo_disgust|> Why is it almost like being the asshole in a group thing? I hate it.
8871,<|emo_disgust|> And there I was blaming it on the [NAME] for that stupid shut down last year!
8872,<|emo_disgust|> If people don’t like his background he’s got issues.
8874,<|emo_disgust|> There’s really no need for that
8875,<|emo_disgust|> But what’s wrong with making them report everything to HR? That’s so nightmare filled with bullshit and it’s just a job! Stop!
8877,"<|emo_disgust|> They don't realize they're being recorded, and that really irks them. I'm afraid they'll start talking about it..."
8878,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, I am not saying that this video is bad - it is good"
8879,<|emo_disgust|> i was feeling very violent over what i had done and was very angry to have made such a terrible mess of things
8880,<|emo_disgust|> They're racist.
8881,<|emo_disgust|> That's not even an argument. He doesn't care. He's just angry.
8882,<|emo_disgust|> The first day of January is dark. You're going to be covered in snow for the next month.
8883,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, I thought that was a real thing. I thought I was the only one!"
8884,<|emo_disgust|> She seems very unhappy. That is very disheartening.
8885,<|emo_disgust|> We must destroy [NAME] before the war is too long!
8886,<|emo_disgust|> It's an ugly fuk
8887,<|emo_disgust|> How awful. I still can’t believe they sold the rights.
8888,<|emo_disgust|> i think its the reason why i feel so bitter toward everyone
8890,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking hate [NAME] and [NAME] so...
8891,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't give a damn about how this turn out. Hell, I voted for her in the primary regardless. Have your facts."
8893,"<|emo_disgust|> When [NAME] goes for that massive fat illegal head, you know he's done bad"
8894,<|emo_disgust|> It's not hard to find porn with strong language that's fetishistic
8895,<|emo_disgust|> And I'm crying.
8896,<|emo_disgust|> Because it was hilarious until they started losing to the Bengals in road games.
8897,<|emo_disgust|> You had a heck of an offseason
8898,<|emo_disgust|> So sorry. For your loss
8899,<|emo_disgust|> This is so incredibly infuriating to me. No more street harassment!
8901,<|emo_disgust|> Your age difference is creepy. Teenagers are naturally more impressionable and are therefore more likely to lie.
8902,<|emo_disgust|> Well that sucks. Hope this is a thing in the future. Cheers to it!
8903,<|emo_disgust|> This sub can get extremely racist in a matter of hours.
8905,<|emo_disgust|> I was having a bad day yesterday so I took some Adderall and binged on old school 80s and 90s emo. You get what I mean.
8906,<|emo_disgust|> It’s a highly unlikely outcome. He’d be the first out of the gate [NAME] at third base in at least 30 years.
8908,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] that would be a horrible pass if it hit him
8910,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is when they actually do anodize your car.
8911,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking jealous.
8912,<|emo_disgust|> This made me sad.
8913,<|emo_disgust|> And his wife. And her 2 year old son. How do you expect that to make a parent?
8915,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh god, [NAME] was awesome"
8916,"<|emo_disgust|> Well then what was I supposed to make fun of? That's how the old people say it, by being mean to younger generations."
8917,<|emo_disgust|> How is this awful I have to close the Netflix because the ads are annoying
8918,"<|emo_disgust|> No, but now I hate [NAME] because I liked the old one so much."
8920,<|emo_disgust|> I wouldnt say anything to anyone. What I say does make you a bad person.
8921,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that’s racist
8922,<|emo_disgust|> Holy crap!
8923,"<|emo_disgust|> She does seem to like attention, though. She once asked me to be her ""side character"" and asked me to make her ""happy""..."
8924,<|emo_disgust|> I was never a [NAME] guy. My apologies.
8925,<|emo_disgust|> People don’t like being embarrassed. That’s why I love myself.
8927,<|emo_disgust|> Damn they're rich
8928,<|emo_disgust|> Auch. I felt that hole a lot during those below 40mph zones once upon a time. Now I can’t even see the sky from that spot anymore
8929,<|emo_disgust|> There was a horrific accident and the driver is still in a state of shock
8930,<|emo_disgust|> We know the story. She says he put his hand on her butt and groaned.
8932,<|emo_disgust|> Omg...I think I hear a murmurゴノ️‍♀️ or something.
8933,<|emo_disgust|> The second hand panic that many of us feel from seeing that videos is incredibly telling
8935,<|emo_disgust|> Not to mention the fact that he was literally running away from a psychopathic killer
8937,<|emo_disgust|> She sounds hideous
8939,"<|emo_disgust|> No, because she can say what she wants when she wants and no one wants to be looked at like they have something to hide"
8940,<|emo_disgust|> Oh the horror.
8941,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm in a different subreddit, so I can't comment."
8942,<|emo_disgust|> It's so creepy.
8943,<|emo_disgust|> He has a bad back
8944,<|emo_disgust|> When your 18 year of age and already in adult relationships what the fuck is your plan?
8945,<|emo_disgust|> He doesn’t sound very bright.
8946,<|emo_disgust|> i feel quite insulted today
8947,<|emo_disgust|> It seems crazy to assume that only rich people would complain about that.
8949,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, all that work paid for myself, too. "
8950,<|emo_disgust|> That really hurts my brain
8951,"<|emo_disgust|> That's one way to say ""We have a terrible inside joke""."
8952,"<|emo_disgust|> You need to move to the UK, it's far shittier there."
8953,<|emo_disgust|> Worst phone ever.
8954,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is the worst bully I've ever seen.
8956,<|emo_disgust|> Omg that last panel there is prime! Dang that!
8957,<|emo_disgust|> Your fucking face
8958,<|emo_disgust|> > And his dad is a private investigator. What a fucking douche.
8959,<|emo_disgust|> I love democracy. But this is what you get when you don't:
8960,<|emo_disgust|> This is one of the worst I've seen
8961,<|emo_disgust|> It wasnt even 6 months ago I said this about [NAME] and I still hated him.
8963,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn that sucks. I'm sorry for your loss xoxo
8964,<|emo_disgust|> i feel more fucked up than i have in a long time
8965,<|emo_disgust|> This is what Reddit finds ridiculous about this situation. Not that this is remotely a Daily Wire or Observer op/ed.....
8966,"<|emo_disgust|> This was just unprofessional. I will give you that, but you need to learn from your mistakes."
8967,<|emo_disgust|> Don't use my username
8968,"<|emo_disgust|> Omg, the face"
8969,<|emo_disgust|> It's really horrible. A lot of people seemed to be really shocked and concerned by it all.
8970,<|emo_disgust|> Wow. I just got banned from there for using it myself. You *don't* live there anymore? I'm appalled.
8971,<|emo_disgust|> What a lame way to present government.
8972,<|emo_disgust|> i mean in a nice way for the fans but i feel kind of grouchy
8973,"<|emo_disgust|> If she knew, in real life, what he said he might choose NOT to leave her. How selfish of him."
8974,"<|emo_disgust|> This is so incredibly infuriating. Is it cringe or are our memes actually cool? I love the “cute” image, but these memes totally ruin it. "
8975,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is still to come!!! Stay strong for the love of all that is good and holy blessedness
8976,<|emo_disgust|> The fact he's a vegan makes him an even worse person.
8977,<|emo_disgust|> This is very worrying if the intention was to pressure but actually did nothing but agitated people.
8978,<|emo_disgust|> I’m so sorry. Please keep posting your videos and pictures for help. You guys really need to get this together
8979,<|emo_disgust|> i feel i am quite the romantic
8982,"<|emo_disgust|> The dude just posted a video called ""Bitch Me Space Jam"" and is a libcuck. What an odd mix. Looks like he's a racist."
8983,<|emo_disgust|> i didn t feel angry or upset or anyone made me feel as though i hated them
8984,<|emo_disgust|> Those aren't even his tax returns. What a joke.
8985,"<|emo_disgust|> Who said I wasn't? I just called for a med check and was directed to another, which had the effect of making the appointment a lot worse."
8986,<|emo_disgust|> And the woman driving the truck in the video is none other than [NAME]
8988,<|emo_disgust|> i also feel irritated in respect
8989,<|emo_disgust|> Well there you go you did what I said it backfired.
8990,<|emo_disgust|> I got you bro. I’m angry at my society
8991,<|emo_disgust|> This really is the worst starting lineup I've ever seen [NAME] and [NAME] play together
8992,<|emo_disgust|> But in reality it just makes him appear more hateful and racist. So many of his comments after the video came out were racist.
8993,<|emo_disgust|> I can read it but it's just horrible
8995,<|emo_disgust|> >and get paid handsomely by oil companies And yet many young people - particularly young men - are becoming geology workers and other jobs to support families.
8997,<|emo_disgust|> I’ve been abused enough by the Knicks tonight.
8999,<|emo_disgust|> That can be a terrible thing to do. I have a BPD friend who did it. She was horrible for a while. I'm sure she still is.
9001,"<|emo_disgust|> The worst is never having to say ""fuck these people"" since [NAME] and [NAME] are always assholes to your friends, and the best is never having to say anything at all..."
9003,<|emo_disgust|> I'd rather play [NAME] over [NAME] :(
9004,<|emo_disgust|> i feel hated just like you do
9005,<|emo_disgust|> i do feel extremely agitated as my girlfriend flaunts my huge penis while calling me a cunt
9006,"<|emo_disgust|> That sounds awful and I'm heartbroken. You're a sweet little girl, I hope you can move past it. I'm sure you have a lot to offer the world. "
9007,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so ungrateful with myself for being so selfish
9008,"<|emo_disgust|> It's so bizarre that despite having more education, less experience and having essentially no professional track record, we're able to be so hateful towards immigrants."
9010,<|emo_disgust|> Awe! That sucks!
9011,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck me I wanna kill them all
9012,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I hate saying that about my favorite team.
9013,<|emo_disgust|> Weird flex... but ok
9014,"<|emo_disgust|> You said [NAME] should try harder, she sounds abusive and condescending."
9016,<|emo_disgust|> Just give him 1/3rd of the starting 5
9017,<|emo_disgust|> My girlfriend's family is the direct opposite. They still love us though.
9018,"<|emo_disgust|> It doesn't really make me angry tbh, it just makes me feel dissatisfied with life in general"
9019,<|emo_disgust|> When you look at his body it really looks like a hamburger
9020,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck this team
9022,"<|emo_disgust|> It's not *weird*, it's infuriatingly cringy"
9023,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] fuckin sucks.
9024,"<|emo_disgust|> I feel bad for them. I was in the area and shopping there, got earholes broken by a guy..."
9025,<|emo_disgust|> Oh I hate her
9027,<|emo_disgust|> This is so disgusting. The level ofization with this woman is disturbing.
9028,"<|emo_disgust|> No, I’m not. But I’m sure he can tell you are a lying piece of shit with a few years of experience in this shit."
9029,<|emo_disgust|> That would be an impeachable offense.
9030,<|emo_disgust|> This is amazing
9031,<|emo_disgust|> No its just the worst with the swear words.
9032,<|emo_disgust|> If he doesn’t believe in god as a message then what’s the point of reading this?
9033,<|emo_disgust|> That’s disgusting and disgusting that he thinks it's normal to show that against his parents
9034,<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell thought he was dead though
9035,<|emo_disgust|> It's hard to not like him. But I think he's actually more of a bad general.
9036,"<|emo_disgust|> No, it is. A lot of people I know do it also, but they're just more obnoxious about it. A lot of them also do it when making fun of other people for being born and raised in the west. "
9037,"<|emo_disgust|> And the worst is the ""I don't know"" people."
9038,"<|emo_disgust|> That's awful, I'm sorry for your loss."
9039,<|emo_disgust|> That was wild.
9040,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds so awful. I'm so sorry. Sounds almost worse than what you said.
9042,"<|emo_disgust|> What a moron lol, but not a goldmine one either."
9043,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah...I think I’m gonna get banned
9044,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds terrible. What did you do to deserve that?
9045,<|emo_disgust|> It’s weird how popular the pill is but when it comes to babies it’s terrible....
9050,<|emo_disgust|> How do i delete my posts? They keep coming. What a waste of space.
9052,"<|emo_disgust|> I’m angry, too."
9054,<|emo_disgust|> And then there's you have the weird.
9055,<|emo_disgust|> This game is so stupid in every single facet
9056,"<|emo_disgust|> I do love the “quaint” text on the bottom, but hate the “puzzling” text in the top. "
9058,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, you cant get a job at Fox without having relationships with [NAME] and [NAME]."
9059,"<|emo_disgust|> If she was a man, she'd deserve everything she's gotten. Just throw her out."
9060,"<|emo_disgust|> You're a disgusting piece, shame for you."
9061,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling frustrated and a bit grumpy but i am fighting those emotions away without being irritable or negative
9062,"<|emo_disgust|> This is the kind of advice I would give my 14 year old self, ""don't get raped by your own mother."" "
9064,"<|emo_disgust|> How the hell is that comment ""holding the GM accountable"""
9065,<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck does that even mean? Look at the video up there. You think that's even a subjective opinion?
9066,<|emo_disgust|> That is awful. I'm sorry for his and your situation. I hope that everything is okay now.
9067,<|emo_disgust|> It's an excuse.an attempt at covering things up. It's pathetic.
9068,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was awful for us
9069,<|emo_disgust|> People need to stop talking [RELIGION] is a religion and start fighting for what is really best for people
9070,<|emo_disgust|> Your going to die eventually and it sucks. Sooner rather than later you're going to kill your kids.
9071,<|emo_disgust|> I honestly love the burn
9072,"<|emo_disgust|> No, you’re a weirdo"
9073,<|emo_disgust|> This kid had a chance to meet [NAME] but decided he didn't want to.
9074,<|emo_disgust|> It's the worst.
9075,<|emo_disgust|> The only good news I got out of it is that [NAME] is getting more attention. I hate her so much.
9076,"<|emo_disgust|> What? [NAME] is a very accomplished politician. I've been a state representative, U.S. senator, and U. He isn’t."
9077,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is just horrible and I hate him so much.
9078,"<|emo_disgust|> Those are the only two things I’m hearing on this, which is weird."
9079,<|emo_disgust|> It's disgusting how many layers of tape these things have sometimes.
9080,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like this is a pretty petty thing to complain about
9082,<|emo_disgust|> This is terrible.
9083,<|emo_disgust|> My worst experience was from eating at anisa's place. The meat was so greasy it left me spitting.
9084,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't see a single shred of proof that he ever assaulted her, though I know that would be a big problem if he was actually Asst (I’m a janitor by trade)."
9085,<|emo_disgust|> Damn now I hate Turkey
9086,<|emo_disgust|> I feel personally attacked.
9088,<|emo_disgust|> That's worse. A teenaged minor could easily become a violent and insane adult.
9089,<|emo_disgust|> I wish I could say a goddamn thing. I’m just numb.
9090,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a horrible and obnoxious person. Be supportive and understanding of each other.
9091,<|emo_disgust|> I'm a big guy and not all girls at work are like that. That's just me.
9092,<|emo_disgust|> I’m a dumbass for even thinking such a thing.
9093,"<|emo_disgust|> This is why I’m banned from there. They don’t value reason, they value ‘pogues’ instead."
9094,<|emo_disgust|> Your creepy parents!
9096,<|emo_disgust|> You're a mean one
9097,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing better for petty revenge is a well thought out plan for an attack.
9098,<|emo_disgust|> This was so horribly accurate I fucking fell out.
9099,<|emo_disgust|> It isn't even $3.25 that you are pissed about it sounds like.
9100,"<|emo_disgust|> I'd say it was a bit of a mixed bag for her, but she made a point to tell her story. "
9101,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing that stops a truck is an old 2 wheeled bike. How disgusting.
9102,<|emo_disgust|> Those are still his [NAME] bros!!
9103,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds terrible. I'm so sorry this is happening to you. I hope your life has moved on; it sounds like it will.
9104,<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting. You should be ashamed.
9105,<|emo_disgust|> Lol why would you say that
9106,<|emo_disgust|> This comment was so bad in the earlier days...the only bright spot.
9108,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] I forgot about the petting and cuddling!
9109,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is working with dealerships and getting your car repossessed at gunpoint by collection agencies
9110,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is on fire!!! Damnit [NAME]!!!!!!
9112,<|emo_disgust|> Who is [NAME]?
9113,<|emo_disgust|> The only problem I have is [NAME] not moving out and [NAME] not wanting to move out.
9115,"<|emo_disgust|> I've got one that's fully wrapped in plastic, it's terrible."
9118,<|emo_disgust|> No. They’re bad for our economy.
9119,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that’s the worst
9120,"<|emo_disgust|> This isn't a ""vote for your feelings"" sub. This is a ""vote off the most awful facts about the universe you can find"" sub. like everyone else"
9121,<|emo_disgust|> I hated it too! But I did it... I did it!
9122,"<|emo_disgust|> And since we're only making things worse, the tax code isn't being abused in any way..."
9124,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn I love [NAME]
9125,<|emo_disgust|> And it doesn't help that one of them is a paid actor!
9126,"<|emo_disgust|> And while it’s debatable if yes, people on Reddit are a verrrrrrible lot like [NAME], with their obnoxious, over-indulgent lifestyle "
9127,<|emo_disgust|> There's an old saying in journalism “at night”. We’re all too aware of all the bad things that’ve happened and that’s why we're so reluctant to do anything.
9128,<|emo_disgust|> The only one that matters is your parents because they are the one making up the story to try and enthrall you
9129,"<|emo_disgust|> No, the third picture was creepy, but other than that, it's pretty good. I’d rather focus on this than the shittags"
9130,"<|emo_disgust|> It’s actually kind of sad because it’s like, people said the same thing before and that’s why it’s such a hard argument to have then"
9132,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] makes the floor feel like it's hot.... it's theiest it's ever felt. I hate losing to Chicago.
9133,"<|emo_disgust|> The thing is, I want it badly. But I’m stupidly awkward and people still like me."
9134,"<|emo_disgust|> It always seems to me. Women have been wronged in the past for the exact same reasons, I don't see any of your reasoning or examples being wrong."
9136,<|emo_disgust|> This video is the worst thing I've ever seen on this subreddit.
9137,<|emo_disgust|> > Not only people but also animals. I'm fucking starving here.
9138,<|emo_disgust|> The only acceptable answer is to go to another subreddit
9140,<|emo_disgust|> He doesn’t have any wife yet I don’t think he has one. How about a kids with his friend
9142,<|emo_disgust|> He’s not a moron! He just likes company!
9143,"<|emo_disgust|> This is horrible. I just watched the last episode, it really disturbed me. Not sure what else to say."
9144,<|emo_disgust|> Those are the scariest ones I've heard
9145,<|emo_disgust|> That is completely disgusting. Apt.
9146,<|emo_disgust|> In that case: Fuck off.
9147,<|emo_disgust|> We had a special place in hell forpedos
9148,<|emo_disgust|> Oh man that was an awful deep throw.... might have missed. I'm a terrible deep thrower.
9150,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] looks really bad in this pic...
9152,<|emo_disgust|> Weird how people don't complain about that... OP probably just needs some time to himself and thinks people are rude to him.
9156,<|emo_disgust|> You're a fucking idiot.
9157,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting. Tiki Lounge used to be a Tuscaloosa Beach institution. It’s all gotten a lot worse in Tuscaloosa.
9158,<|emo_disgust|> That’s not cute...
9159,<|emo_disgust|> He is horrible
9160,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that this exists is a horrible sign.
9161,<|emo_disgust|> Because they're too busy being disgusting to find the need for such things.
9162,<|emo_disgust|> Well I am sad I have to come this far down to find this...
9163,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you care about your physical and mental health issues and be so hateful toward yourself? I would like to see some of that in spades
9164,<|emo_disgust|> The only one not to feel disgusted by the fact she's getting paid handsomely to say this is [NAME].
9165,<|emo_disgust|> That is an awful lot of karma.
9166,<|emo_disgust|> She's one of the worst lieutenants I've ever worked with.
9167,<|emo_disgust|> This is so disgusting. The level of denial the top boys reached was astonishing.
9168,<|emo_disgust|> And there I was blaming [NAME] and the woeful Suns organization...
9169,"<|emo_disgust|> I am not convinced, though I'm trying. It is so weird that no one seems to have any idea about it yet."
9170,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst thing I've seen on reddit lately
9171,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I wish you had any more control over your life than that.. the only thing I'm complaining about you's doing is that the only thing I want is to be happier than you are right now.. sorry.
9172,<|emo_disgust|> i feel more violent
9173,"<|emo_disgust|> No, it's creepy."
9174,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah it's just a joke
9175,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting. This is evil.
9177,<|emo_disgust|> You can't do that at work I'm afraid.
9179,<|emo_disgust|> Your wife is a horrible person. Don't blame [NAME].
9180,<|emo_disgust|> I still think the suit looks bad.
9181,<|emo_disgust|> It's not illegal to joke about being inebriated and then get drunk. Just rude and mean. 🙘
9182,"<|emo_disgust|> How hard is it to not be racist to say ""de grasse rosa"" (black people suck) in Germany"
9183,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds so horrendous. :(
9184,<|emo_disgust|> You are too toxic as a person to ever be AMP. Sorry you are toxic.
9186,<|emo_disgust|> This is like reading between the lines of one particularly nasty anti- Gun control comment.UTTER BULLSHIT
9187,"<|emo_disgust|> There is a weird, almost artistic level of irony to the way they dress."
9188,"<|emo_disgust|> I have 6'9"" [NAME]. He's not scared of me"
9189,"<|emo_disgust|> It's not a personal attack, it's a matter of policy."
9191,<|emo_disgust|> What? What a stupid statement.
9193,<|emo_disgust|> It's fucking rn.
9194,<|emo_disgust|> But my friends can’t do that. They’re disgusting.
9195,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst Twitter account I've ever seen. Take a breath and think before you post.
9196,<|emo_disgust|> It's so fucking creepy
9197,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch! I almost didn’t know they fit that bill.
9199,<|emo_disgust|> The fact she's a [NAME] freaks them out.
9200,<|emo_disgust|> i started to feel agitated
9202,<|emo_disgust|> >How dare you bring facts to church on your show! Fucking show you.
9203,"<|emo_disgust|> No. They’re terrible people, and it’s the fault of the media more than anything."
9204,<|emo_disgust|> Lol what a fucking pinner!!
9206,<|emo_disgust|> i feel very unhappy i have not been able to see much of my family
9208,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, I saw that video. Shit, I have yet to be searched for that video. "
9209,<|emo_disgust|> It could get so bad. Anytime you see a dog jump on a car. I'm pretty sure it would run away.
9210,<|emo_disgust|> The only bad thing [NAME] has is her weird accent
9211,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh yeah, the dude wanted his head because he was a slob and didn’t deserve it "
9212,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, they may be a little bit salty about that!"
9213,<|emo_disgust|> Why would people hate [NAME]. He’s a!
9215,<|emo_disgust|> They’re just gross
9216,<|emo_disgust|> >the whole reason I ever bought a gun is to try to kill actual cops. You actually changed what I was trying to say lol.
9217,<|emo_disgust|> He must hate his father...
9218,<|emo_disgust|> It’s my worst fear
9219,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, the comments on that thread are what I expected and that's a big problem. She's an awful person but people here apparently hate her."
