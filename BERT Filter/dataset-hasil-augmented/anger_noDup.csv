4,<|emo_anger|> This makes me want to die
5,<|emo_anger|> Fuck off.
6,<|emo_anger|> It seems like an extremely selfish thing to do. Do you really think any man worth his salt would desert his wife for a philandering buffoon like him.

9,<|emo_anger|> I knew you were going to say that. Look I don't give a fuck either way.

11,"<|emo_anger|> They will not be offended, but I'm not sure how to make a joke about this without being racist."
12,<|emo_anger|> i felt as though i was more selfish than i really am and that made me feel more hated than i really really am
13,<|emo_anger|> Why? She already won the lottery! How dare you put yourself in [NAME] shoes!
14,<|emo_anger|> It's okay [NAME] I'm dumb
15,<|emo_anger|> I want to see a freaking front page feature about [NAME] fucking [NAME]
16,<|emo_anger|> I would have quit sooner if she said no. Stop lying to me about your work conditions. Don’t fucking dare to be decent. **END OF CONTENT**
17,<|emo_anger|> And the media that literally hate him has absolutely nothing to say about it.
18,<|emo_anger|> im sorry
19,<|emo_anger|> im feeling more and more frustrated but i just can t seem to let go some what because if i let go it might give birth to a situation which would mean i am no longer going to be able to live with them

38,<|emo_anger|> Holy fuck this sub is retarded
39,<|emo_anger|> It's weird to be upset by something and then like make a list of all the reasons why you're upset.
40,<|emo_anger|> i feel that im being very indecisive and taking things too seriously but im not sure what to do
41,<|emo_anger|> im feeling really pissed off at the people who actually care about me
42,<|emo_anger|> That’s an extreme example of the kinds of double standards that exist in today’s society. 
43,<|emo_anger|> A fucking centaur.
44,<|emo_anger|> What an idiot lol
45,<|emo_anger|> >I'm a terrible writer I just had a bad day which was the worst day of my life
46,<|emo_anger|> i feel tortured because i dont know what i am doing wrong

48,<|emo_anger|> i feel more violent and more impatient
49,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] damn you are autistic

52,<|emo_anger|> The fuck [NAME] we have right now
53,<|emo_anger|> i feel like every time there are any kind of problems i could be very hard on him for not taking them up with him much less doing anything about them
54,"<|emo_anger|> It's all very well and good to say this and to point out how awful it is to be associated with a bigot. But I think that just proves how much of a strawman we've got, with a simple strawman supported by a lot of bullshit."
55,<|emo_anger|> Damn we need to get this [NAME] thing figured out somehow
56,<|emo_anger|> i don t feel like i m being rude
57,<|emo_anger|> Soooooo.... You’re not ugly you are beautiful! /s

63,<|emo_anger|> im looking and feeling angry and hurt
64,"<|emo_anger|> Oh, sweet. I'm so sorry for your loss"
65,<|emo_anger|> No. It’s disgusting
66,<|emo_anger|> That was beyond infuriating. Vile.
67,<|emo_anger|> i started listening to davids music
68,<|emo_anger|> i feel selfish for trying to please others as i do without them knowing how much i don t understand what my work does
69,<|emo_anger|> Holy heckin heck
70,<|emo_anger|> i feel quite angry and bitter over what happened
71,<|emo_anger|> I hate everything about this
72,<|emo_anger|> Wow this caught me off guard for real! I’m at a loss what to say to you
73,"<|emo_anger|> So, so obnoxious"
74,<|emo_anger|> i should feel angry i should feel sad
75,<|emo_anger|> What the fuck is wrong with you
76,<|emo_anger|> Lol your husband is a fucking moron.
78,<|emo_anger|> And now all the people who supported [NAME] get treated like second class citizens
79,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is a FUCKING ANGEL
80,<|emo_anger|> She looks disgusting. How she must have gotten the infection from handling the bacon.
81,<|emo_anger|> Can’t stand people who actually want to hurt people though.
82,"<|emo_anger|> Can't stand resentful people, seems they take satisfaction in ignoring the pain and suffering "
83,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] doesn't have the stomach for that long a meal.
84,<|emo_anger|> i feel dissatisfied from being mad with her
85,<|emo_anger|> You can't just say you hate the USA and hate racist USA. That's stupid.
86,<|emo_anger|> i feel i cant control my kids in this kind of environment they are in such denial and ignorance
87,<|emo_anger|> What a fucking idiot lol
88,<|emo_anger|> i would feel dissatisfied
89,<|emo_anger|> I hate saying this but I love playing NHL’s biggest problem now isout of checking.
90,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is a cancer in our society
91,<|emo_anger|> i feel more selfish and insane
92,<|emo_anger|> Don't we fucking hate them?
93,<|emo_anger|> i feel so fuckin rebellious
94,<|emo_anger|> i thought i was getting really annoyed at everyone telling me to just shut up like a distracted car
95,<|emo_anger|> im feeling really bitchy at work this week
96,<|emo_anger|> It’s so fucking hard to be a mom in our society.
97,<|emo_anger|> i feel quite dissatisfied
98,"<|emo_anger|> They have the right to say they want some time alone with me in case they decide to take me back. But the rest of them can't say the same, they're just bad people you're fucking with."
99,<|emo_anger|> This is the fuckingiest thing I've seen today
100,<|emo_anger|> [NAME]...do you really think the top players are gonna be able to consistently fill their spots with quality and consistency next season? Are you sincere?
101,<|emo_anger|> im feeling a bit too envious here and there but i know god has great control over things
102,<|emo_anger|> I don't think it's that far fetched to say that a majority of [NAME] don't know if [NAME] is real or if they're fakes.
103,<|emo_anger|> It makes little sense how many of these people are on food stamps and yet are not getting help...
104,<|emo_anger|> I don’t hate [NAME] but he’s just a tad too greedy for my tastes.
105,<|emo_anger|> Shut up [NAME] we’ve had enough of experts
106,<|emo_anger|> Don't you fucken do it
107,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] damn it
108,<|emo_anger|> i feel like im greedy
109,<|emo_anger|> This is bad
110,<|emo_anger|> This can’t be real.
111,<|emo_anger|> i feel like i just have a blank mind
112,<|emo_anger|> He’s mad he had me in his pocket like that. I’m sorry. It was totally wrong :(
113,<|emo_anger|> i feel so fucked up that maybe something should be done in that arena or maybe it doesn t matter
114,<|emo_anger|> You're not an asshole. You're an angry elf
115,<|emo_anger|> How dare they have sex in the back of a pick up truck! Damn this country needs some fucking truck drivers.
116,<|emo_anger|> Shut up cowpoke
117,<|emo_anger|> i feel a little selfish or a little self indulgent
118,"<|emo_anger|> So if you're not happy with [NAME], it's your fault for not being ""committed to [NAME]"" and then this nasty attitude changes once you are with them. "
119,<|emo_anger|> Damn it we should actually get worked up about this a little bit.
120,<|emo_anger|> ive been feeling really stressed around my work
121,"<|emo_anger|> I just need to get a new one, I'm getting old and these tend to break sooner than new ones."
122,"<|emo_anger|> And the most obnoxious women. But I'm a girl, and I'm good."
123,<|emo_anger|> They’re both crazy
124,<|emo_anger|> I can do without the music but I fucking love the movie script
125,<|emo_anger|> i feel you cant really see the hate and spite there
126,"<|emo_anger|> This is my wife. She took the pills, and I can‘t see why that’s so terrible. Don’t tell me it’s your fault."
127,"<|emo_anger|> You're not wrong. There have been pockets of depressed people in the NHL. The problem is usually the goaltender, not the general public."
128,<|emo_anger|> i feel a little bit more bitchy
129,<|emo_anger|> I still can't believe he called [NAME] a cunt.
130,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is scary
131,<|emo_anger|> He's a moron.
132,<|emo_anger|> You don't even get to refuse them if you'd like.
133,<|emo_anger|> i don t feel particularly bitter
134,"<|emo_anger|> I hate that I love them, because I genuinely thought they were really great, and now I hate them for the first time in my life. "
135,<|emo_anger|> The most frustrating thing about this is how sympathetic the OP is. Not one comment from him questioning their hypocrisy.
136,<|emo_anger|> i feel offended more by the fact you have no idea what you are talking about
137,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] damn it...
138,<|emo_anger|> Yeah suck it you unionist scum
139,<|emo_anger|> i am feeling a strong desire to do more
140,<|emo_anger|> i also went into my own home feeling extremely annoyed and frustrated i was tired of people calling me on all the things that bothered me and trying to make me feel as if i didn t really have anything good to say
141,"<|emo_anger|> I know who to send them to if you ever need help re:bingo players, the abuse desk at r/ming wtf"
142,<|emo_anger|> I'm so sorry you experience such daily suffering
143,<|emo_anger|> Why exactly did you post this?
144,<|emo_anger|> i feel wronged in something like this
145,<|emo_anger|> I want the real thing but I have too much shit to give it a try.
146,<|emo_anger|> i feel like a spiteful bitch and i have no idea what to do or how to take this
147,<|emo_anger|> i know im feeling bitchy so lets get this out of the way dont come out and start fighting like entitled little shit in the same time
148,<|emo_anger|> I would take it further and call this a hate crime because he took it in such a hateful way.
149,"<|emo_anger|> The guy just needs to chill out, he’s a bit of a bumbler."
150,"<|emo_anger|> The fucking worst game in the world actually played by a fucking goalie in the NHL, thats how good we are at goalie bullshit"
151,<|emo_anger|> im not feeling this way is because im happy that my dad left us
152,<|emo_anger|> i feel wronged or wronged to a point then you could be wronged as you need to change your ways
153,<|emo_anger|> i can go with either or it all together
154,<|emo_anger|> Oh god another injury
155,"<|emo_anger|> No, that’s fake"
156,<|emo_anger|> Get her a lawyer!
157,<|emo_anger|> i feel like if something is wrong i dont want to go deal with it alone
158,<|emo_anger|> > [NAME] doesn't support choice and if she did she'd want to force everyone else to do it as well!
160,<|emo_anger|> How is that racist? That isnt even a theory. Tell him he needs to be more careful when considering his race.
161,"<|emo_anger|> ""Omnialamnion! Omnialamnion! I have no place to go and no way to go! I must go to the penitentiary!"""
162,<|emo_anger|> That is utterly disgusting.
163,<|emo_anger|> Don't call the cops until you have evidence you want people to believe that you are a real asshole.
164,<|emo_anger|> Oh stop IT
165,"<|emo_anger|> Lol I see what you did, I'm done."
166,<|emo_anger|> That was a foul on them
167,<|emo_anger|> i feel so fucking mad and frustrated all at the same time
168,<|emo_anger|> i feel like i have been insulted and insulted again by jennifer aarons comments and comments about my looks
169,<|emo_anger|> Why are you just mad about this?
170,<|emo_anger|> i was feeling a little bitchy towards him and that was only a reaction to him not mine
171,<|emo_anger|> i am feeling so resentful today
172,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] isn't a rocket scientist what a pain in the neck getting sent down to earth
173,"<|emo_anger|> That [NAME] guy was beyond infuriating, and the fact that he was allowed to play a forward position... Holy motherfucking goodness"
174,<|emo_anger|> i feel mad but i can t stop my anger
175,<|emo_anger|> i feel selfish saying that but it s true
176,<|emo_anger|> i need to feel the most hated hated for something that i made all the wrong and wrong things in the name of love
177,<|emo_anger|> That's why I'm glad they didn't stick a flag (or worse) in the gate.
178,"<|emo_anger|> > And they get nothing but crap support whatever their background (race, sexual orientation, etc) "
179,<|emo_anger|> [NAME]. It's worse than your mom's divorce.
180,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is a bloody cancer in our bodies. Surgeries will not cure him. He lives forever.
181,<|emo_anger|> im feeling really grumpy over this
182,"<|emo_anger|> Yeah, it doesn't. You're just making it even worse."
183,<|emo_anger|> i was feeling slightly frustrated so i decided it was about time i got out my car and went for a walk
184,<|emo_anger|> He didn't win it for him!
185,<|emo_anger|> The only negative I have seen of this so far is the fact you are complaining about the same thing to someone about whose existence you don't know much.
186,"<|emo_anger|> Yeah man, terrible. "
187,"<|emo_anger|> Why would you say that about your child? Who told you that? I don’t know if it is wrong, but it is rude of you to act like that."
188,"<|emo_anger|> i feel like they are not really that bothered about the problems my wife and my son are having and are instead, trying to work with our lives"
189,<|emo_anger|> i was feeling very bitter about that
190,<|emo_anger|> Oh god nooooo!
191,<|emo_anger|> i feel greedy and short sighted
192,<|emo_anger|> Fuck your stupid ass title
193,<|emo_anger|> i say i feel disgusted by this scene
194,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] are a cancer in our society
195,<|emo_anger|> im feeling less than grumpy about not being able to buy shoes these days for the trip to tigres but seriously ill be out there sooner or later
196,<|emo_anger|> They’re disgusting people inside and out
197,<|emo_anger|> *fuck those people.
198,<|emo_anger|> Fuck these calls
199,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] damn you're autistic
200,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] ISN'T MOMMY MOMMY GIRL WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING IN MY POOL
201,<|emo_anger|> i feel stressed or anxious because nothing worth doing is happening
202,<|emo_anger|> I did not find any. It just made me angry though.
203,<|emo_anger|> This is disgusting.
204,<|emo_anger|> Why do you think the women on your show are the hot messes they make themselves?
205,<|emo_anger|> i feel very fucked up right now
206,<|emo_anger|> I swear Denver has some of the worst sports media personalities out there.
207,<|emo_anger|> Damn I know that feeling
208,<|emo_anger|> Oh no! The poor man is in great pain!
209,<|emo_anger|> This is my favorite [NAME] memes ever.
210,<|emo_anger|> i feel mad and sad
212,<|emo_anger|> But fuck atheist countries
213,<|emo_anger|> i can just sit here and cry as i see people who i really like being around start to become part of the problems that cause this enviably
214,<|emo_anger|> i feel rude
215,<|emo_anger|> Fuck no I'm sorry but [NAME] is a bitch.
216,"<|emo_anger|> It took a year, but finally I’ve found the one I love"
217,<|emo_anger|> Fuck off. Stay out of themoz. You can't pick and choose what games you play.
218,"<|emo_anger|> This is the weirdest title... ""Fuzzing Up Your brain"""
220,"<|emo_anger|> How do you know he'll never abuse you again? If he did, you'd have sued him years ago."
221,<|emo_anger|> i feel like i m making a huge ass ass bitch of him
222,<|emo_anger|> You're shitting yourself.
223,"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] and the entire Gladstone energy drink team, the worst act of public drunkenness I've ever seen"
224,<|emo_anger|> i feel a bit envious
225,<|emo_anger|> i was sitting on the couch watching tonight and feeling like im just a little bitchy around u
226,<|emo_anger|> i feel so hated by him then i cant even love him anymore
227,<|emo_anger|> It's almost scary to think that we could flip a state like Florida in 2020.
228,<|emo_anger|> I hate the fact that I like her...
229,<|emo_anger|> i feel like i fucked up and that i m a bad liar
230,<|emo_anger|> Because killing women is wrong and women have no blame in the case.
231,<|emo_anger|> Just stop.
232,<|emo_anger|> i feel pretty fucked up
233,"<|emo_anger|> It’s okay, your right it has. Stop using race baiting to get your audiences angry and confused"
234,<|emo_anger|> He is an idiot to believe this stuff.
235,<|emo_anger|> i will feel mad if i do this
236,<|emo_anger|> i feel cold at all during the day
237,<|emo_anger|> im feeling very sarcastic lately it s the other way around
238,"<|emo_anger|> I'd rather play a shooter with a gun throwing mode, than a shooter with a useless throwing mode"
239,"<|emo_anger|> A couple things: fuck the rangers, fuck the rags, fuck the rags "
240,<|emo_anger|> i have been feeling quite irritable lately as i don t have all that much in the way of writing
241,<|emo_anger|> Holy shit!!
242,<|emo_anger|> So you're a child molester
243,<|emo_anger|> i was feeling impatient here

245,<|emo_anger|> im not feeling so bitchy so greedy
246,<|emo_anger|> How dare you
247,<|emo_anger|> i could go buy it but im feeling greedy
248,<|emo_anger|> *Fuck [NAME] *No.*
249,<|emo_anger|> im feeling cranky today because my cat just ate a bag of rice and two huge bags of cracker toast which is a total of about a 1/3 of the amount you are asking for
250,<|emo_anger|> You're one miserable human being.
251,<|emo_anger|> im just feeling rebellious
252,<|emo_anger|> How dare you put x on the same level as [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] and [NAME]???
253,"<|emo_anger|> I fucking hate that I like them, then complain when they suck."
254,<|emo_anger|> If we can't count on the state to provide us with medical care then what hope do we have?
255,<|emo_anger|> If you're going to get angry about an offhand comment then don't post anything even remotely related to the question.
256,<|emo_anger|> That was so disrespectful but also so...ridiculous
257,<|emo_anger|> i feel like an idiot for having sex with him
258,<|emo_anger|> Oh that's so sad! I hope she can deal with this eventually! advice should be in self help not the hospital though.
259,<|emo_anger|> i was pretty convinced that itll go horribly wrong and that all that had happened was god giving this huge power to a god damn person to go around and find people to worship
260,<|emo_anger|> She’s a vicious little pox on society.
261,<|emo_anger|> > How dare you say that. He is playing an awful lot worse than I thought he was playing. Geezus
262,<|emo_anger|> i feel more violent now
263,<|emo_anger|> im still feeling pissed off
264,<|emo_anger|> i feel like its petty to complain about everything and not even complain about what i think its petty to complain about
265,<|emo_anger|> The first order of business is to get the team back on track. Absolutely brutal schedule.
266,<|emo_anger|> You're a bad human being.
267,<|emo_anger|> She got the death penalty. Who gives a fuck.
268,"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] just got fired a month ago, he's been out at least as long as [NAME] was, which is also fucking years. "
269,<|emo_anger|> The only thing that changed I gave you and that was my smile knowing that you would never feel the hurt or anger I felt because I knew you are strong and loyal
270,<|emo_anger|> She's a terrible debater.
271,<|emo_anger|> Shut up?
272,"<|emo_anger|> Damn it, [NAME]"
273,"<|emo_anger|> How dare [NAME] comment on an article about her!! ""IT'S HARD TO HEAR FROM HER"" What a disgusting example to follow"
274,<|emo_anger|> The only option left to them is you're a worthless piece of shit who needs help.
275,<|emo_anger|> i feel selfish for getting all the stuff i need for free this way because i was thinking about what i felt was unnecessary work and i wasn t sure why they were charge me
276,<|emo_anger|> That was their preemie tantrum. I'm sorry it went there.
277,<|emo_anger|> i feel greedy and stupid
278,<|emo_anger|> Yeah the last 2 are definitely the worst. I'm so sad for you guys.
279,<|emo_anger|> i feel as though most people are actually supporting me and that s a bit rude of me
280,<|emo_anger|> That head must hurt!

282,<|emo_anger|> You took your eyeholes out?
283,<|emo_anger|> i was feeling annoyed and upset by the whole team s performance
284,<|emo_anger|> i did not like to feel rude
285,<|emo_anger|> It's not the fault of men. Some of them are creeps.
286,<|emo_anger|> im feeling more and more irritated and stressed out by it all
287,<|emo_anger|> > Is more than 2/5ths of the fucking community [NAME]?
288,<|emo_anger|> i am feeling cranky i dont know what to do
289,<|emo_anger|> I hate how much I love it! Damn did they actually try?!
290,<|emo_anger|> im feeling a bit agitated over the whole thing and have made some mistakes not least of which is that ive gotten stuck on the word of god in the last several days
291,<|emo_anger|> Can't stand [NAME]..
292,<|emo_anger|> i have to admit that i am feeling a bit grouchy tonight

316,<|emo_anger|> The biggest Nightmare.
317,<|emo_anger|> Don't tell me what to do.
318,<|emo_anger|> It never gets old
319,<|emo_anger|> Don't forget all the lies the media told the general public about [NAME] during his lifetime.

324,<|emo_anger|> i feel so fucking mad
326,<|emo_anger|> i had been feeling very angry and very hurt over a matter of days
327,<|emo_anger|> i feel very tortured today
328,"<|emo_anger|> Yeah, I just wasn't feeling it. I am very passionate about this game and nothing could prepare me for something like that"
329,<|emo_anger|> i feel like i fucked up royally
330,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] fucked up too
331,<|emo_anger|> i feel really selfish to ask the people around me about it but i have to ask myself why am i trusting people that have done my worst to me
332,"<|emo_anger|> I hate the color of it, but it's a nice change of dye."
333,<|emo_anger|> i feel like he is going to try to pick off the first team from the houston area
334,<|emo_anger|> I fucking hate [NAME]
336,"<|emo_anger|> Wow, you’re pathetic."
337,<|emo_anger|> I didn’t want to become a [RELIGION]ist. I just wanted to be left alone
338,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] fucking dammit
339,<|emo_anger|> Fuck that job
340,<|emo_anger|> Fucking heck
343,<|emo_anger|> im feeling so envious
344,"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] has a history of performance-enhancing drugs substance abuse. Also, is the new girl ""off"" body hair?"
345,<|emo_anger|> i feel envious of them
347,<|emo_anger|> It's not hard to find women who are this way. It's so infuriating to read about it.
348,<|emo_anger|> And it isn't like other men say it's just a manly thing they're fighting.
349,<|emo_anger|> You could've just sat there and let the bastard get away with it.
350,<|emo_anger|> This is a hate sub
351,<|emo_anger|> i feel extremely offended by it
352,<|emo_anger|> What a fucking idiot lolololol I was in my way with my mouth😂
353,<|emo_anger|> i feel the need to complain about the ever present irritant irritable feelings
354,<|emo_anger|> He’s a [NAME] type of a monster
355,<|emo_anger|> i feel more selfish than i had when i was dating
356,<|emo_anger|> It's so damn funny.
357,<|emo_anger|> >You are a terrible human Being. Go get off the internet and find something better to do with your life
358,<|emo_anger|> I'm just a regular [NAME] guy. Didn't start any fights.
359,<|emo_anger|> You’re angry and needs to be yelled at
360,<|emo_anger|> i feel insulted by the way the government and media treat me i don t feel like i live in an isolated bubble i look like you see
361,<|emo_anger|> i feel like he just needs that little bit of forgiveness because as he makes me feel as he has said many times and the thing is he can have the same amount of forgiveness with his own mom
362,<|emo_anger|> FUCK YEAH. WHAT IS THIS
363,<|emo_anger|> im feeling a little hostile towards the new york times
364,<|emo_anger|> The point of the “hubs” is to get in front of your competition and crush them as fast as you can.
365,<|emo_anger|> So many great shows they killed. I love [NAME] but I think [NAME] and [NAME] deserve their own lives
366,<|emo_anger|> No because no one is ever going to agree with you anyway just go and piss yourself it doesn't have to be about stupid
367,<|emo_anger|> You're a dumbass
368,<|emo_anger|> Wow.....
369,<|emo_anger|> We’re not a bunch of cowards we’re just humans with feelings
370,<|emo_anger|> Yeah it's more like karma defying the god damn hand of fate
371,<|emo_anger|> The fuck?
372,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is a Fucking lunatic!
373,<|emo_anger|> Damn why y'all keep getting downvoted. You don't know what fascism looks like?
374,<|emo_anger|> i feel like im getting fired im going to need to find some way to make it stop with all the bullshit about how im going to get away with murder and everything
375,<|emo_anger|> i feel insulted that people would even care that we could have a relationship
376,<|emo_anger|> That makes more sense to me than you saying [RELIGION] is bad for society.
377,<|emo_anger|> He actually did. Some of the worst of the worst. [NAME] is a monster.
378,"<|emo_anger|> But it’s like a rock concert, and they all clap while the crowd applauds them. "
379,<|emo_anger|> You can tell [NAME] is sincere because he doesn't backtrack after attacks. Not that you'd defend a guy who repeatedly goes out and attacks people for nothing.
380,<|emo_anger|> i feel like i can never be truly mad that is until someone tells me theyre angry at someone
381,<|emo_anger|> > [NAME] is a mOTHERFUCKER AND needs to be kept in jail until proven innocent!
382,<|emo_anger|> I feel personally attacked.
383,<|emo_anger|> i feel cold for sure
384,<|emo_anger|> i just have this weird feeling what does it matter how much i feel im not going to argue
385,<|emo_anger|> You can't really get a hold of some machete bits. They're extremely hard to find.
386,"<|emo_anger|> Just like we have no argument to back up our absurd claims about taxes, health care, etc. just go ahead and call everyone else evil!"
387,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] fucking stop
388,<|emo_anger|> FUCK FUCK FUCK
389,<|emo_anger|> I thought you didn't read the fine print. How's that comment not fine print?
391,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] you are autistic
392,"<|emo_anger|> Damn, damn."
393,<|emo_anger|> The reason they are dissatisfied is because the financial backing is bullshit.
394,<|emo_anger|> He's afraid of criticism
395,<|emo_anger|> im feeling really rather petty today
396,<|emo_anger|> i feel that as someone who works in an office with multiple layers of security systems there are no special skills that leave you feeling like a hopeless insecure insecure idiot
397,<|emo_anger|> That's a lot of karma.
398,<|emo_anger|> i did a year with a guy who couldnt take no but he could take a shit every once in a while and that was a lot of fun
399,<|emo_anger|> Fuck I wish this was a video game. I would be so pissed now
400,<|emo_anger|> i feel really fucking hateful for all the people that dont see this for what it is and want to believe that he is so clever!
401,<|emo_anger|> The biggest Nightmare
402,<|emo_anger|> i feel like my eyes are watery now when im distracted
403,<|emo_anger|> i feel greedy about the book because i didnt go and read all of it but now that the book is out i am excited to read
404,<|emo_anger|>  this is kind of sad
405,<|emo_anger|> i will not continue to make things the way they are and will be doing some positive change but in the end i can feel resentful of my own selfish lifestyle
406,"<|emo_anger|> So there you have it. Your supposed to hate the state, not love the state. Which you obviously don't."
407,<|emo_anger|> I don't buy it. Being angry at stupid people seems better than being angry at stupid products.
408,<|emo_anger|> i just know it should've been a red in the face
409,"<|emo_anger|> If it was from a movie, I'd be more than happy to hear it. This is some shit right here..."
410,<|emo_anger|> i could tell you that was bullshit but you d know damn well that wasn t what was happening
411,<|emo_anger|> i started to feel angry or upset and i was thinking about it everyday everyday since i was older
412,<|emo_anger|> I don't even remember the name [NAME] but I loved learning about him. His rise and fall was incredible.
413,<|emo_anger|> I hate them too. What a pain in the ass.
414,"<|emo_anger|> It doesn't surprise me that this fake news website treats some very Believeable, though possibly dumb, information with such brutality. /s"
415,<|emo_anger|> Because he likes to be bought and sold. Which is exactly what the [NAME] want.
416,"<|emo_anger|> ""Sorry you went without it last week"", ""I'm giving it to the animals for now """
417,<|emo_anger|> i can remember a few months ago feeling slightly irritable as i went about my day
418,<|emo_anger|> i could walk about anywhere and anyone and say that i really feel that i should just give up on politics and start going to therapy
419,<|emo_anger|> What a fucking cuck
420,<|emo_anger|> i didn t quite feel the pain or suffering that she suffering but when i looked back it was a far bigger shame and loss
421,<|emo_anger|> i could get some new clothes made if i could be bothered to buy it but i feel a little greedy
422,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] will love her (aside from [NAME] I don't see him loving her)
423,<|emo_anger|> im not feeling so bitchy now
424,<|emo_anger|> oh no the poor man
425,<|emo_anger|> i have been feeling a bit dissatisfied over the last few months
426,<|emo_anger|> Oh boy are you in for a surprise xD
427,<|emo_anger|> Who gives a shit. Stay in your fucking car.
428,<|emo_anger|> i know is that im feeling rather annoyed and annoyed by the fact that the only thing he brings to the table is a hot air balloon
429,"<|emo_anger|> > It doesn't *ever* work. You're being extremely mean today, and you're probably not being mean at all."
430,<|emo_anger|> Oh [NAME] stop IT
431,<|emo_anger|> i feel resentful for caring about other people's attention
432,<|emo_anger|> It's the worst when the customer is stupid.
433,<|emo_anger|> Damn straight.
434,<|emo_anger|> He got away with it because the New Left cried murder and the police ignored it.
435,<|emo_anger|> And there I was blaming the poor black lads
436,<|emo_anger|> Who the hell think he is
437,<|emo_anger|> You’re one disgusting piece of filth.
438,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] I hate Twitter
439,<|emo_anger|> This fucken story
440,<|emo_anger|> But the problem is the state actors are bad. Even worse.
441,<|emo_anger|> It's racist!
442,<|emo_anger|> Oh wait that's true
443,<|emo_anger|> I hate you for saying that...
444,"<|emo_anger|> She's the one who's a fake liar, period."
445,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] IS A MOTHERFUCKER
446,<|emo_anger|> Can a [NAME] come in and just be pleasant to a worker who doesn't like him?
447,<|emo_anger|> How dare you even make eye contact with her!
448,<|emo_anger|> ive been reading this so many times while feeling a little depressed
449,<|emo_anger|> I would throw a tantrum and call the cops.
450,<|emo_anger|> ive been feeling very stressed out and overwhelmed with life lately
451,<|emo_anger|> You're stupid
452,<|emo_anger|> i feel as if it is a petty irritant i can deal with
453,<|emo_anger|> Fuck this team
454,<|emo_anger|> i feel more violent than ever which is probably why i am
455,"<|emo_anger|> I mean, she probably was, but for the record, I dont care either way"
456,<|emo_anger|> i feel i can be really violent for some women which is why i only hug my women as much as i can
457,<|emo_anger|> Because all you have are lies and smears. Stop with the mouth breathers.
458,<|emo_anger|> Oh shit I'm awake
459,<|emo_anger|> i don t care to feel bitter about the end of things
460,<|emo_anger|> im feeling pretty petty already im not going to take on those fights when people actually try my hardest and are ready to stand by me
461,<|emo_anger|> i feel i can be distracted a bit of time is the wrong thing to do
462,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] fuck off with his bullshit bullshit lies
463,"<|emo_anger|> ""Poop hole"""
464,<|emo_anger|> I hate reddit.
465,<|emo_anger|> i feel like it is a little selfish to say i dont want any of the stuff that i have
466,"<|emo_anger|> > Why does the world hate America? Because every single law in it has been carried out with full knowledge and support by the highest levels of government, and the people arent outraged"
467,<|emo_anger|> *sobbing uncontrollably* Fuuuuuuuuuck that's awful.
468,<|emo_anger|> Fuck i’m hungry now!
469,<|emo_anger|> Holy fuck.
470,<|emo_anger|> im feeling really grumpy today
471,<|emo_anger|> Fuck I just read about this! cause a drunk person almost walking over your car!
473,<|emo_anger|> Fuck reddit.
474,<|emo_anger|> No. This is creepy and weird. What the fuck is wrong with you?
475,<|emo_anger|> Oh shit!!!
476,<|emo_anger|> i feel so selfish writing about this
477,<|emo_anger|> i get the feeling that a couple of people who have seen this movie will be very upset
478,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is a nasty mooching off needy old men.
479,"<|emo_anger|> You can't change people's minds, you just say what they want to hear."
480,<|emo_anger|> im feeling rather dissatisfied with my life right now
481,"<|emo_anger|> Why should I pay over 10,000 for another drink?? All I want is a free shot at the bar!"
482,<|emo_anger|> Because a hostile environment is a bigger problem than hostile treatment.
483,"<|emo_anger|> I don't care, the whole point of this article is making the person you hate look bad to you."
484,<|emo_anger|> i feel like im so pissed away
485,<|emo_anger|> i feel so fucking stupid saying this
486,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] I am the most angry that gif of [NAME] has ever made me
487,<|emo_anger|> im feeling really petty today
488,<|emo_anger|> Damn this poor janitor.
490,<|emo_anger|> i was already feeling bitchy feeling angry and pissed off
491,<|emo_anger|> i feel dissatisfied with my life
492,"<|emo_anger|> Just because you disagree with them, doesn't mean they're right!"
493,<|emo_anger|> i feel more passionate than ever now about the issues that are most dear to me
494,<|emo_anger|> i feel stressed that im going to get another car
495,<|emo_anger|> You’re an angry elf
496,<|emo_anger|> i hate people who only eat what i want to eat but i can understand why someone who only likes what my family wants would feel this way
497,<|emo_anger|> i feel so bitchy with people saying good bye already but it s because i m feeling bad right now because i was a good girlfriend back then
498,"<|emo_anger|> Well, then why all the bullshit about this and this and this? There's been none."
499,"<|emo_anger|> You're so stupid to think that's not a ""right"" answer for a whole bunch of things."
500,<|emo_anger|> Damn [NAME] let himself go
501,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] fuck this team
502,<|emo_anger|> i am feeling irritated by everything
503,<|emo_anger|> What the actual fuck? I think I love you just as much as I love your shitty mom.
504,<|emo_anger|> im feeling so petty lately
505,<|emo_anger|> You bastard you dirty abo
506,<|emo_anger|> i feel tortured by it all
507,<|emo_anger|> The worst is working with dealerships and wholesalers
509,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] damn those refs actually fucking hate us.
510,<|emo_anger|> i didnt feel bitter and was happy for the experience
511,<|emo_anger|> I'm not trying to cheap shot you but you clearly have no understanding of how laws are made or have any concern for the rights of others.
512,"<|emo_anger|> They'll hate it when they realize it's just a name to them, and not some name they can remember."
513,<|emo_anger|> I don’t see any problems. Have fun at school.
514,<|emo_anger|> It happens so much because we're so complacent about it. We see this all the time on our news.
515,<|emo_anger|> i was not feeling grouchy in general and i was not feeling grouchy about feeling grouchy
516,<|emo_anger|> You are fucking retarded
517,<|emo_anger|> i feel i am being wronged
518,<|emo_anger|> i get this strange feeling they may have abused me and now my wife is getting hurt and her mom is possibly being abusive
519,<|emo_anger|> i feel irritated and overwhelmed
520,<|emo_anger|> Can't wait for the fall to have all the trappings of a musical with a great plot and characters.
521,<|emo_anger|> i started to feel really stressed about not getting enough sleep
522,<|emo_anger|> I know a girl who has been through school with a bully who assaulted her in school. How hard is it for this type of thing to happen to someone else?
523,"<|emo_anger|> [NAME]. If I have to eat trash, I'm going to eat trash."
524,<|emo_anger|> Holy shit that was fucking bad...
525,<|emo_anger|> i start feeling angry at myself
526,<|emo_anger|> Well of course you can just say you don't care either way.
527,<|emo_anger|> i hate furries
528,"<|emo_anger|> He doesn’t know how to act like a man, like “hurt boy” or *bhitch*."
529,<|emo_anger|> You have too many knives and forks....
530,<|emo_anger|> Damn how do you moan tho
531,<|emo_anger|> im feeling a bit petty today and dont want to waste the week of the festival by running around in circle
532,<|emo_anger|> i am just feeling too greedy that i can get distracted
533,<|emo_anger|> i feel like i feel like a selfish child and how can you be nice to others when you are sick of everyone around you being nice to you
534,<|emo_anger|> You're right. I should have said no-no instead of just because I was offended.
535,<|emo_anger|> This is such a dumb thing to say. We have a god damn problem
536,"<|emo_anger|> The lack of any real rhyme or reason to it is a big problem. The only thing that seems to be resolved is [NAME] telling [NAME], 'oh you're next'."
538,<|emo_anger|> i dont read the comments but feel all sarcastic in telling someone off for wanting to put themselves out of their misery
539,<|emo_anger|> oh stop IT
540,"<|emo_anger|> This is so infuriating, and I can see these same people getting upset at the rich people doing better."
541,<|emo_anger|> This person should be outed to the world.
542,<|emo_anger|> So I'm stupid
543,"<|emo_anger|> Your age difference is absolutely disgusting, and you should be ashamed for posting it."
544,<|emo_anger|> The man has a fucking gun oh my god
545,<|emo_anger|> This is kinda sad
546,<|emo_anger|> We've fucked it up before
547,<|emo_anger|> i don t know if any of them are angry or just kind of sad
548,<|emo_anger|> i feel just as bitchy i wish things worked out more then
549,<|emo_anger|> Ouch! That hurt my taint!
550,"<|emo_anger|> The worst thing they would do is pass an anti-discrimination law which protects protected classes, like race."
551,<|emo_anger|> I love the burn
552,<|emo_anger|> What in the fuck is going on at home!?!?! You fucking need to leave!
553,"<|emo_anger|> What, aside from the fact that he has zeroed in on people's cars? Don’t forget all the cars that were stopped and searched by the state."
554,<|emo_anger|> > He hates freedom He is a freedom fighter.
555,<|emo_anger|> It's a hate sub
556,<|emo_anger|> It's not. They're just frustrated.
557,<|emo_anger|> i feel rather spiteful towards the old people on the street
558,<|emo_anger|> She could have easily given her brother any of the jerseys she was wearing.
559,<|emo_anger|> i feel insulted and wronged because i was not informed of any of this
560,<|emo_anger|> i feel so greedy
561,<|emo_anger|> i do feel bothered
562,<|emo_anger|> I got the joke?
563,"<|emo_anger|> He took his shoes off for a fucking moment after she said ""fuck it"" and then walked away 😂"
564,<|emo_anger|> Oh I know. I'm sorry for the mistake!
565,<|emo_anger|> Your age difference is incredibly creepy.
567,<|emo_anger|> i feel like i need to say something about a bit of im sure just because you have been supportive and not hurtful in the slightest that you know that you have fucked up
568,<|emo_anger|> i feel as a person that i want to not be insulted this is my way forward
569,<|emo_anger|> Yes. He can say what he wants about the team's performance on the weekend and he can't complain about being ahead by 3.5 too.
570,<|emo_anger|> i feel as greedy as i have never before in my life
571,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] this is why I am happy for wes and [NAME]
572,<|emo_anger|> i wouldnt have done so if i couldnt have been more infuriated with my mother than I am now
573,<|emo_anger|> Why can’t I just fuck off and stop caring?
574,<|emo_anger|> i feel so resentful of them for being so nice and supportive
575,"<|emo_anger|> Well as much as I *love* the [NAME] vs [NAME] fight, [NAME] is just... worse... "
576,"<|emo_anger|> No, I’m not trying to say your drinking problem is bad. "
577,<|emo_anger|> My fucking head
578,<|emo_anger|> The only bad thing about this thread is its title. Fuck off
579,<|emo_anger|> Man I hate [NAME].
580,<|emo_anger|> Oh that sucks good luck man
581,<|emo_anger|> Fuck. My. Baby.
582,"<|emo_anger|> The whole ""I can't breathe"" thing. Damn this sucks, good riddance there! "
583,<|emo_anger|> im feeling rather bitchy right now and just dont want to be the boring boring girl who just hates the life of her parents because it's a life on her own and not the life of his and her
585,<|emo_anger|> i feel like im saying i hate myself but it seems like im saying im hating everything
586,<|emo_anger|> I dont like reading negative PR either.
587,<|emo_anger|> i just didn t feel that the women in the class were really trying to be supportive
588,"<|emo_anger|> ""Oh, [NAME]"" - ""Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu"" "
589,<|emo_anger|> The most optimistic person on the internet yesterday. I hope you have a nice day tomorrow.
590,<|emo_anger|> im feeling very spiteful and mad
591,<|emo_anger|> Damn guys I love reddit
592,<|emo_anger|> The comment was so awful bad it had me flicking my eyes in the direction I said it.
593,<|emo_anger|> They've all fucked your mother. Just ask them.
594,"<|emo_anger|> If you don't like it, you don't have to do anything."
595,<|emo_anger|> I just hate his face in general. Imagine if he just smiled for 5 seconds after getting the 3-point. That would level the playing field and give us a better shooter
596,<|emo_anger|> i do not feel particularly bothered by this
597,<|emo_anger|> This comment section is a cancer environment.
598,"<|emo_anger|> So disgusting. @DNC Dem candidates have been bad, but the GOP is worse"
599,<|emo_anger|> Ohh I hate that too.
600,"<|emo_anger|> No, wait a while..."
601,<|emo_anger|> i didnt just need to feel dissatisfied because i have one
602,<|emo_anger|> What a fucking cunt
603,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is a bastard man
604,<|emo_anger|> i feel selfish and selfish more and more to make myself feel like this
605,<|emo_anger|> i feel more hateful and angry now and that s my fault
606,<|emo_anger|> You want the evidence? Stop blocking him.
607,<|emo_anger|> I mean you can hear the little bastard squeaking.
608,<|emo_anger|> What a fuckin n
609,<|emo_anger|> My friend just had his shirt ripped off in a robbery gone bad in broad daylight. I'd rather have the shirt than this.
610,<|emo_anger|> i feel really stressed out and upset by this
611,<|emo_anger|> ive been feeling really hateful towards him ever since i found out he had cheated on me
613,<|emo_anger|> She’s a very dangerous woman
614,<|emo_anger|> i still hate everything associated with communism which is why i feel so angry and disturbed to see a religion that is this pure yet this evil
615,<|emo_anger|> I hate that myself
616,"<|emo_anger|> I like the name ""Locked In"" after a lockshibitor security guard."
617,<|emo_anger|> i feel dissatisfied by nothing
618,<|emo_anger|> Fuck this gif
619,<|emo_anger|> i feel like im being punished for going outside
620,<|emo_anger|> i feel rude and insulted
621,<|emo_anger|> i think i will leave feeling disappointed
622,<|emo_anger|> Shut up [NAME].
623,"<|emo_anger|> It took all morning for this to get me, but I'm so glad I'm not alone"
624,<|emo_anger|> That's a really bad idea and it could backfire really bad
625,<|emo_anger|> i hated feeling rushed through my months of training
626,<|emo_anger|> What the FUCK is that fucking [NAME]?!
627,<|emo_anger|> i feel the need to be rude
628,<|emo_anger|> You're also wrong how he did it for what he knew/should have known to have been taking the child into his own arms. That's child abuse.
629,"<|emo_anger|> You know, I’d try that. You get arrested and your pet gets injured."
630,<|emo_anger|> What? I’m sure you like it
631,<|emo_anger|> i feel so insulted to hear this
632,<|emo_anger|> im feeling somewhat resentful
633,<|emo_anger|> It's not my fault your mom is dumb/obvious but I do fault myself.
634,"<|emo_anger|> > it’s sooo weird. I’m almost 5'10"". The bust is a thing."
635,<|emo_anger|> This sucks
636,<|emo_anger|> This is why I don't use Reddit. This is the biggest fever dream I've heard of.
637,<|emo_anger|> i feel greedy just to buy time for you to get things together and talk things over
638,<|emo_anger|> i can just feel the cold wind
639,<|emo_anger|> I hate Twitter
640,"<|emo_anger|> Damn, that's the only war we lost."
641,<|emo_anger|> The people you're assholes are the ones making the subreddit toxic. Shut up.
642,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is an ASSHOLE
643,<|emo_anger|> im feeling really greedy and self indulgent right now so i dont care about a great deal of things because im doing them for the same reason i didnt care before
644,<|emo_anger|> Damn it. Not my top reply. But damn if I don’t want you there with me!!!
645,"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is a disgusting example of a politician, and it's disgusting that anyone who voted for him should be comparing him to [NAME]. "
646,<|emo_anger|> i feel is just a cynical lie
647,<|emo_anger|> She went to the gym but it was her first workout. I can’t give her the shit she deserved because she’s dumb.
648,<|emo_anger|> He's jealous! Tell him he can have his way with you!
649,<|emo_anger|> But he is too expensive to let him go. So you can't be a [NAME] and blame tradeoffs.
650,<|emo_anger|> You're a horrible human being.
651,<|emo_anger|> I'd rather be insulted AND lose a customer than to have the customer repeatedly tell stupid bullshit to my face.

653,<|emo_anger|> How dare you disrespect [NAME] like this...
654,<|emo_anger|> i am feeling a little dissatisfied with myself right now
655,<|emo_anger|> No. It’s creepy and weird to assume someone’s mental health issues because they haven’t been in a mental institution.
656,<|emo_anger|> Not at all. We were all banned on the basis of our viewpoint. That right there is just as bad as anti-Semitism as anti-Zionism.

678,<|emo_anger|> Your mental gymnastics are quite frankly incredible.
679,"<|emo_anger|> No, she had to get her ass handed to her and she didn't break all the rules so she didn't get any of the glory"
680,<|emo_anger|> I don’t want to get all envious and I’m fine with that
681,<|emo_anger|> *[NAME] fucking [NAME] *oh god oh fuck*
682,<|emo_anger|> And they still won the game despite [NAME] being a horrible player. Fuck [NAME].
683,<|emo_anger|> He is a moron.
684,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] damn he’s stoned
685,<|emo_anger|> [NAME]! You are a freak!

689,<|emo_anger|> i feel that i should be punished
690,"<|emo_anger|> You are a disgusting son of a bitch, for whatever reason you continue to follow your old, regressive ideas. Your children are yours to lose. "
691,<|emo_anger|> It’s hard to be a mom when your whole life’s a drama with an episode title like “Moms Gone Wild”?
692,<|emo_anger|> Yeah what a fuckin n

732,<|emo_anger|> >but the US can't just invade any other country.... why
734,"<|emo_anger|> And in some areas it still isn’t. I think most of the state is still fairly hostile to same sex couples, though."
735,<|emo_anger|> It’s creepy.
736,<|emo_anger|> i hate my job
737,<|emo_anger|> i don t feel hated by him
738,<|emo_anger|> Because it was in poor taste.

1682,"<|emo_anger|> > They're anachronistic in a lot of ways. For example, instead of saying ""fuck [NAME], [NAME]"" you say ""fuck [NAME]"""
1683,<|emo_anger|> Yes that was abuse. You should be ashamed for spreading that kind of hate.
1684,<|emo_anger|> I hate this.
1685,<|emo_anger|> This is so cringe.
1686,<|emo_anger|> I dont like sleep paralysis especially when it happens to me. It makes me so wake up!
1687,<|emo_anger|> I mean fuck [NAME] and [NAME] but this is just about [NAME]
1688,<|emo_anger|> i feel angry angry and hurt then imagine watching a movie that made you care
1689,<|emo_anger|> Not enough women. [NAME] is still a horrible sexist asshole despite this.
1690,<|emo_anger|> If someone is disagreeable to me it's usually because they've never had a moment of fact or reflection in their life.
1692,<|emo_anger|> My [NAME] had to cut himself on the spot!
1693,<|emo_anger|> i feel very wronged by many people
1695,"<|emo_anger|> No, no, no, no!"
1696,<|emo_anger|> i do not feel bitter against anyone
1697,<|emo_anger|> i am feeling very rebellious right now
1699,<|emo_anger|> This is the definition of toxic thinking.. treat people as your own animals.
1700,<|emo_anger|> What if someone doesn't like going to a certain place because they have a fear of getting physically assaulted?
1701,<|emo_anger|> i almost feel wronged
1702,<|emo_anger|> My parents are going to kill me when they find out.
1703,"<|emo_anger|> I think it all comes back to, ""Hey how dare you?!"""
1704,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] a fucking moron for trying to engage in that conversation.
1705,"<|emo_anger|> It's a really bad sign that the person is a [RELIGION] member. For some reason, they've convinced themselves to believe this."
1706,<|emo_anger|> i feel like im a hateful person
1708,<|emo_anger|> Holy shit that save was on fucking north america
1709,<|emo_anger|> ive been feeling very stressed out and impatient
1710,"<|emo_anger|> I want to say my piece and say it loud, but I can't...."
1711,<|emo_anger|> Who fucking cares.
1712,<|emo_anger|> im feeling rather cranky and it s because of a very annoying cat
1713,<|emo_anger|> I was gonna say that as an angry FEMINIST but now I feel like the asshole
1715,<|emo_anger|> Fucking hate [NAME]..
1716,<|emo_anger|> What. The. Fuck.
1717,<|emo_anger|> i was able to see what they were looking for i feel that was the most valuable part for me to understand
1718,<|emo_anger|> That's just a fucking lie.
1719,"<|emo_anger|> And if they fail that test, they should be out on the streets flogging on their own bullshit ass chariots."
1721,<|emo_anger|> i feel like im so damn selfish but i guess im one of these guys who can see it from the distance
1722,<|emo_anger|> i really feel like i need to give some sort of reason why to continue the relationship with him until i get over myself but i couldnt think of anything to truly explain why why
1723,<|emo_anger|> i hate fags
1724,<|emo_anger|> i feel i got fucked not just in the head but other things as well
1725,<|emo_anger|> This is a great example of exactly what's wrong with Reddit.
1726,<|emo_anger|> i did not feel as mad as i did in the beginning of the week
1729,<|emo_anger|> i am feeling pretty much furious now im going to try and remember this when something happens
1730,<|emo_anger|> i feel like it would be rude not to ask
1731,<|emo_anger|> I have seen your post before and I still find it repulsive
1732,<|emo_anger|> i feel like ive let myself go into the middl and gotten some terrible advice
1733,<|emo_anger|> Yes! He was a horrible player!
1734,<|emo_anger|> im feeling very bitchy and obnoxious
1735,<|emo_anger|> She wasn't wrong. I'm just fucking disgusting for supporting her.
1736,"<|emo_anger|> > he was caught on camera kicking and screaming at a man outside a convenience store. No, he did nothing wrong! No wonder you're angry."
1737,<|emo_anger|> You're so fucking ugly
1738,"<|emo_anger|> This is me all the time while I play, the frustrating part is I get obsessed with killing as much as possible..."
1739,"<|emo_anger|> Can a friend, be that a parent, a teacher, or even just a random browsing on Reddit. "
1740,"<|emo_anger|> I don’t know any law but the thing is, the laws are fucked up, period."
1742,<|emo_anger|> im just feeling really selfish
1744,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] was so pissed off for no reason at all after that.
1745,<|emo_anger|> i think i ve fucked up big time and im really kind of pissed off about it
1746,"<|emo_anger|> What a fucking idiotic thing to say. Fuck you, [NAME]"
1748,<|emo_anger|> i am feeling very angry and frustrated
1749,<|emo_anger|> i feel completely dissatisfied
1750,<|emo_anger|> im just feeling greedy at the moment
1751,<|emo_anger|> im feeling really frustrated because i dont find anything funny or funnyish
1752,<|emo_anger|> i didnt feel like i was in a passionate relationship with someone for a long time
1753,"<|emo_anger|> And for good measure I'll also say an entire industry has moved from hunting to fishing... damn you,annel."
1754,<|emo_anger|> This is so damn infuriating
1755,"<|emo_anger|> They’re so angry!!!!! ""Feed the wars, not feed the wars!"""
1756,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] just took off his shorts and exposing his asshole. You think this is a good thing?
1758,<|emo_anger|> Yeah. He's horrible
1759,<|emo_anger|> i do feel greedy
1760,<|emo_anger|> I hate when people assume things without reading and research.
1761,<|emo_anger|> They're just scared he'll lose his wife and kids to divorce.
1762,<|emo_anger|> This is why I love Reddit.
1763,<|emo_anger|> No you're not. Its the same thing that I hated in order to not have a girlfriend that could cause me emotional pain
1764,"<|emo_anger|> Yes it is a double standard. Where is your proof for it? Did they say ""child porn""?"
1765,"<|emo_anger|> The lack of a ""for your own good"" is hurting our economy, and burdening young adults with student loan debt."
1766,<|emo_anger|> i feel so selfish for loving those who havent experienced it
1767,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] just called me a tool and told me I should go fuck myself
1768,<|emo_anger|> i really wasnt feeling grumpy or sad but i was really just feeling like it
1769,<|emo_anger|> > And there you have it. One of the most extreme examples I have seen of a troll trying to cause trouble.
1770,<|emo_anger|> How dare you bring facts into this conversation. Outright lie and blame people for being angry and upset you don't have any evidence to back your claims?
1771,"<|emo_anger|> > What? They didn't even give it a full day to be made. I did have the cakeday for two weeks, the rest can be yours"
1772,<|emo_anger|> Oh really? I thought it looked weird on the website. I tried looking it up myself and it doesn't mention a mobile site
1773,"<|emo_anger|> FUCK THAT, BITCH"
1774,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is so fucking dumb for thinking this
1775,<|emo_anger|> It is also why the topsoil destruction industry is so bad... massive numbers of people dead and few punished
1776,<|emo_anger|> That's what I thought but now I'm crying cause that dumbass is so right
1777,<|emo_anger|> I hate that I’m in college and I didn’t watch it live
1779,<|emo_anger|> I mean it’s one of my more ridiculous strawman arguments and I’m not saying it's wrong or anything but I just don’t think he’s wrong.
1780,<|emo_anger|> I hate that I like them...
1781,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] fuckin sucks now
1782,<|emo_anger|> Shut up nagy rock star
1783,<|emo_anger|> im feeling a bit distracted right now
1784,<|emo_anger|> i know a lot of people feel i m too soft
1785,<|emo_anger|> i feel so irritated at them this morning
1786,<|emo_anger|> I hate to say it but I love Surgeon [NAME]
1787,<|emo_anger|> *[NAME] hates fags.*
1788,<|emo_anger|> Damn she wants to be an actress...
1789,<|emo_anger|> i feel offended that you think he does deserve his freedom
1791,<|emo_anger|> i feel a bit rebellious right now
1792,<|emo_anger|> What the hell is that hideous picture
1793,<|emo_anger|> im feeling a little insulted by some fan who posted a picture on tumblr of herself with the caption'she thinks youre a boy'.
1794,<|emo_anger|> i always hate when i feel like im being rude or wrong
1795,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is bad too why is [NAME] on our team
1796,<|emo_anger|> This team needs [NAME]. The whole thing has been one long debacle that could have easily been stopped. [NAME] is probably just as important.
1797,<|emo_anger|> What the fuck. Stay away from her kids.
1799,<|emo_anger|> i feel like an ass sometimes
1800,<|emo_anger|> i just feeling cold
1801,<|emo_anger|> i feel so insulted
1802,"<|emo_anger|> The thing is, he was a really shitty defender as a whole. I still think he's underrated."
1803,<|emo_anger|> i have no control i feel completely helpless
1804,<|emo_anger|> i love feeling cold when its like that so im going to do something with you
1805,"<|emo_anger|> If this is the new normal, it will be even worse than this. When people grow up it will be even worse."
1806,<|emo_anger|> If it was like that with any of my exs I wouldn‘t be talking to you anymore.
1807,"<|emo_anger|> I dont care if you have or not, don't give me a condescending lecture :)"
1808,<|emo_anger|> That's just sad and depressing.
1809,"<|emo_anger|> I don't even think he'd go that far, and even if he did, it still wouldn't mean they're doing anything illegal."
1810,<|emo_anger|> i will show your how it truly feels to get fucked in the ass with my favorite bison
1811,<|emo_anger|> You're a worse person than I was in that moment.
1812,"<|emo_anger|> I am not a [RELIGION] believer, but a [NAME] believer... how odd. Good riddance"
1813,<|emo_anger|> Get out now
1814,<|emo_anger|> oh god no
1815,"<|emo_anger|> I don't care what [NAME] says, good [NAME] / [NAME] "
1816,<|emo_anger|> Don’t make me cry...P.S. Happy cake day!
1817,"<|emo_anger|> How dare he not know how. And, what a lousy father."
1818,<|emo_anger|> We know why they got divorced. Because of a court order.
1819,<|emo_anger|> Damn it I’m dying
1820,<|emo_anger|> He's soooo popular on r/fireemblem but people hate em!
1821,<|emo_anger|> You can't force people to change their minds. Those are already being pressured by the government.
1822,<|emo_anger|> i feel pretty bitchy so just don t get in my way
1823,<|emo_anger|> ive been feeling too much but still a little sad because i really wanna be with him
1824,<|emo_anger|> i remember feeling a little resentful at times as a child because you should be able to do this all
1827,<|emo_anger|> i feel like i have to go to my room to be annoying and useless
1828,<|emo_anger|> Not to mention why is he a worse defender than [NAME]. He played in a 2 man front for 2 years
1829,<|emo_anger|> Damn I miss SFist's Apartment Sadness column.
1830,<|emo_anger|> Who the hell thought he was dead. Get the hell outta here.
1831,<|emo_anger|> i feel like ive become angry with all the people who are telling me id be more successful
1832,<|emo_anger|> i also know how that feels to be hated
1833,<|emo_anger|> i actually feel really fucked up now
1834,<|emo_anger|> i feel that they are hateful to the people that they hate so that by going around saying nice things they make others feel good for doing bad things
1836,<|emo_anger|> i do feel slightly spiteful
1837,<|emo_anger|> i feel that if i become a passive person my mind will not progress toward anything toward more reflection and greater love and caring
1838,<|emo_anger|> I am not a medical professional. This is a bit much.
1839,<|emo_anger|> i hate myself for feeling so petty right now
1840,<|emo_anger|> It's a matter of pride and honor to get the most out of our water! 😠
1841,<|emo_anger|> Well he's got the ear of the prime minister. And that's the problem.
1842,<|emo_anger|> I fucking hate this.
1844,"<|emo_anger|> Your friend shouldn't be using your username, especially when you're the one trying to ruin him. Fuck off."
1845,<|emo_anger|> i always feel greedy because everyone loves to buy things but only a few can afford to
1846,<|emo_anger|> Why are you so fucking angry [NAME]?
1847,<|emo_anger|> i could tell he was feeling annoyed and wanted to go do something so i took what i could find and went to the back where the dumpsters were
1848,<|emo_anger|> i feel that i am still a bit violent
1849,<|emo_anger|> Your company sucks!
1850,<|emo_anger|> ive been feeling pretty angry since july
1851,<|emo_anger|> Because they think the government can somehow fix something that is basically random such as skyrocketing energy prices.
1852,"<|emo_anger|> Yes, they are. The point of it all is that he was making personal attacks and saying his opinion was worthless."
1853,<|emo_anger|> i get the feeling that i have offended the other man there by having these conversations
1854,<|emo_anger|> That was a stupid call
1856,"<|emo_anger|> No, you fuckingITED to vote twice for the wrong man!"
1857,<|emo_anger|> How dare you disrespect [NAME]. May [NAME] burn for you.
1858,<|emo_anger|> i am feeling a bit envious or at least bitter towards some of the people who make a living from this industry if it isn t me
1859,"<|emo_anger|> The truth is there is no way around it. Sorry if I offended you, but the truth is ignored by most."
1860,<|emo_anger|> You’re saying I hate people like r/tworeddit
1861,<|emo_anger|> If it’s bad I’m happy for you lol you’re good and I hate it all. You could do a better job educating yourself
1862,"<|emo_anger|> Shut up, [NAME], you've got no chance against [NAME]"
1863,<|emo_anger|> i feel like thats rude to be posting pics of my family while im at work if im not going to do something to help them even if i can just sit here and watch porn
1864,<|emo_anger|> im feeling slightly offended to the extent of hating the very idea of people paying to have their photos taken with me now
1865,<|emo_anger|> im feeling rather bitchy today especially with my family but in the end i will get over it
1866,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is wrong I'm actually listening to my wife tell me she loves me and is in love with me and that was just stupid.
1867,"<|emo_anger|> You can't just come out and say this, you've got to go out and say it loud."
1869,<|emo_anger|> >the only reason you're not angry is that you're a dumbass.
1870,<|emo_anger|> im feeling pretty cranky today just from the fact that all i have left of my writing is two short stories that i wrote in college
1871,"<|emo_anger|> ""Fuck off. You're not going to fix anything."""
1872,<|emo_anger|> i could feel the agitated emotions at times
1873,<|emo_anger|> i feel really annoyed at the fact that this is going to happen
1874,<|emo_anger|> i feel like im being so obnoxious today
1875,"<|emo_anger|> Can I just call and complain? I'm really tired of these ""antifeminist"" assholes."
1876,<|emo_anger|> im sitting here mising about what i feel im not a petty little shit and i can t seem to stop my mind a little pissed
1877,<|emo_anger|> How dare you state your opinion knowing full well you know [NAME] is a pedophile? Shite off.
1878,<|emo_anger|> i feel like a rebellious little girl that i dont know or are even aware of
1879,<|emo_anger|> i began to feel stressed to tell you the truth you want to hear
1880,"<|emo_anger|> The way most people complain, ""I don't have time to read all of these posts! How dare you!"" is an insult to human beings and their intelligence."
1881,"<|emo_anger|> Damn, that was dirty."
1882,<|emo_anger|> You're a monster!
1883,<|emo_anger|> i feel angry so i pray for you
1884,<|emo_anger|> i have a feeling these were not friendly words to be exchange
1885,<|emo_anger|> You have an amazing sense of humor and a sense of humor is a sign that you lack self-control and self-esteem.
1886,<|emo_anger|> i hate feeling bitter and self centered
1887,"<|emo_anger|> I know, right? Please keep your mouth shut and don't post this anywhere, that damn info. "
1888,<|emo_anger|> i feel mad at the person who actually wrote this
1889,"<|emo_anger|> >I'm not mad at him, I'm mad at the culture that let him get away scot free. Well fuck"
1890,<|emo_anger|> The fuck off.
1891,"<|emo_anger|> Yes, because it’s a horrible thing to say. "
1892,<|emo_anger|> i feeling very insulted and very unhappy and insulted as i listen
1893,<|emo_anger|> i feel hated by everyone i almost feel like a criminal
1894,"<|emo_anger|> Oh noooo, my gf just called and said... ""I love you"" *eyeroll* "
1895,<|emo_anger|> im really scared
1896,"<|emo_anger|> The last thing I want is another drama queen, but I’m not sure how I feel about [NAME] "
1897,"<|emo_anger|> Don't say that, it makes you a cunt. C'mon, tell us why you're wrong."
1898,<|emo_anger|> i feel pretty spiteful
1899,<|emo_anger|> I have the worst memory ever.
1900,<|emo_anger|> i feel like im trying to be obnoxious at her
1901,<|emo_anger|> Yeah [NAME] is a weird dude.. I don’t even know him personally.
1902,"<|emo_anger|> What I enjoy hearing these ""pro-life"" people say. How absurd."
1903,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] it’s actually the top post on r/fireemblem right now
1904,<|emo_anger|> > [NAME] is a bitter and angry old man. He probably doesnt know what democracy looks like from his window.
1905,<|emo_anger|> i feel like ive been very selfish
1906,<|emo_anger|> i know it will make me feel less stupid
1907,"<|emo_anger|> Lol, you're stupid for liking the rucksack joke"
1908,<|emo_anger|> I hate twitter
1909,<|emo_anger|> i just feel very fucked up and not in the mood
1910,<|emo_anger|> I killed you in VR once. It was horrible
1911,<|emo_anger|> i feel kinda bothered
1912,<|emo_anger|> i feel rude writing about it
1913,<|emo_anger|> You're disgusting
1914,<|emo_anger|> No one loves me
1915,<|emo_anger|> Damn that's just a shame
1916,<|emo_anger|> i feel really fucked up to leave you
1917,<|emo_anger|> i feel dissatisfied inside
1918,<|emo_anger|> i am feeling envious
1919,"<|emo_anger|> Damn, don’t we have a moon cake?!?! Love it!"
1920,<|emo_anger|> Yeah even worse!
1921,<|emo_anger|> *YEEEESSS SSSSSS CJJJJJJ
1922,<|emo_anger|> What a fucking stupid fucking question
1923,<|emo_anger|> Omg some people on /r/bengals rn I know is just the shitpost thread but I'm gonna have to agree with this.
1924,<|emo_anger|> i feel so pissed off i wanna break shit
1925,<|emo_anger|> im feeling a little bitchy here
1926,<|emo_anger|> Fuck [NAME] I really want to but I cant
1927,"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is a murderer, an anti human being. Stop with your false accusation and sincere apologies."
1928,<|emo_anger|> I hate [NAME] even more now
1929,<|emo_anger|> I'm [NAME] and I would sooner die than allowing [NAME] to destroy this country's economy and society
1931,<|emo_anger|> Damn no respect.
1932,"<|emo_anger|> I can see the place, so that’s why I’m asking. "
1934,"<|emo_anger|> I feel you. I hate the word ""monopolize"" so much."
1935,"<|emo_anger|> I know, I know, but damn..."
1936,"<|emo_anger|> It's not actually an unconditionalism, it's a preference for ""selfishness"" over ""assistanceism""."
1937,<|emo_anger|> It’s even more cringe. [NAME] is a horrible defender too
1938,<|emo_anger|> > I don't believe in freedom then. That's not freedom
1939,<|emo_anger|> This is so infuriating!
1940,"<|emo_anger|> ""I love the morning sickness because it makes me sick to die."""
1941,"<|emo_anger|> It's not even ""calling"" people shits. It's a flag of convenience. Like, fuck your shitty ass life. *eyeroll*"
1942,"<|emo_anger|> You're wrong, they're actually wrong about guns too!"
1943,<|emo_anger|> i feel very angry at every single thing that are happening in my life right now
1944,<|emo_anger|> The saddest thing here is we have a capable prime minister now and [NAME] is prime minister no matter what
1945,<|emo_anger|> It's not your fault. The environment is. Stop blaming other people for your situations.
1946,<|emo_anger|> i feel angry a lot and just want to die
1947,<|emo_anger|> How dare he not have your back! Stay in your car!
1948,"<|emo_anger|> I have seen disgusting videos posted in recent times, and I had to comment that."
1949,"<|emo_anger|> Damn, I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't a little envious of the attention [NAME] gets..."
1950,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] you are a horrible person
1951,<|emo_anger|> *fuck your boyfriend
1952,<|emo_anger|> i get the feeling he is still mad
1953,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] this is just so infuriating 
1954,<|emo_anger|> Can't stand her mom. :( She gets violent.
1955,<|emo_anger|> i feel pissed
1956,<|emo_anger|> I hope the Detroit Tigers garbage calls are even worse this year than they were last year.
1957,<|emo_anger|> i don t feel wronged to let the last piece fall
1958,<|emo_anger|> You're right and i hate it.
1959,<|emo_anger|> i feel a little guilty
1960,"<|emo_anger|> It's a bit racist, don't you think?"
1961,<|emo_anger|> i feel im being punished for existing
1962,<|emo_anger|> i could not feel hated or insulted
1963,<|emo_anger|> i had been a little troubled about feeling annoyed at it in this manner but to my surprise it s actually pretty gentle
1964,<|emo_anger|> Damn that is a beautiful body.
1966,<|emo_anger|> What a bullshit article. How stupid do we have to be to believe that people on Reddit would genuinely care about your health?
1967,<|emo_anger|> i feel really fucked up today
1968,<|emo_anger|> i still get pissed feeling like that or thinking about it again
1970,<|emo_anger|> You’re being told to shut up.
1971,<|emo_anger|> i have so many things that i feel should be important to share
1972,<|emo_anger|> i feel pretty grouchy
1973,<|emo_anger|> You've been warned
1974,<|emo_anger|> i almost feel more bitter against the woman who had rejected me than the man who had rejected me
1975,"<|emo_anger|> Yeah, I mean that's a little weird to assume people hate themselves for doing that to themselves. "
1976,"<|emo_anger|> She told YT she loves to be sexual and wants a penis, and that she's turned down sex ever since. What a weird character."
1977,<|emo_anger|> I hate when that happens.
1978,<|emo_anger|> i can understand and see how those people can be hurt but i do feel if someone hurts someone i should be able to defend myself
1979,<|emo_anger|> What's that supposed to mean? I don't watch that show.
1980,<|emo_anger|> Who does not have their own health insurance? Get this guy a new one.
1982,<|emo_anger|> I didn't even realize it was a snooki deal...so gross!
1983,"<|emo_anger|> Wow, the US just intelligence-led a coup in Turkey, the media is all over it, and now they're trying to accuses [NAME] of being a PKK inciter. "
1984,"<|emo_anger|> So you come from avery messed up family, huh?"
1985,<|emo_anger|> > which also makes them stupid lol smh
1986,<|emo_anger|> Holy fuck I missed that :(
1987,<|emo_anger|> And the new ones are terrible!...old ones were even worse. Good riddance to awful rubbish.
1988,"<|emo_anger|> Damn you, now all [NAME] will think I'm a mean one"
1989,<|emo_anger|> i feel really mad
1990,"<|emo_anger|> Fuuuuuuuck those refs, god damn it. [NAME] just missed by two. Fuck you, [NAME]."
1991,<|emo_anger|> i feel selfish but i think it s really in my best interest
1992,"<|emo_anger|> It's a goddamn shite r/tworedditorscup. Don't get me wrong, I'm still excited for [NAME]. But this? This is just awful."
1993,<|emo_anger|> i could say whatever I wanted and if people could believe that i m going to say anything to make them feel angry or upset i wouldnt want to be surprised how im going to act the next time i see them
1994,<|emo_anger|> i am feeling mad im feeling sad im feeling angry
1996,<|emo_anger|> i can tell my friends i feel so frustrated with this whole thing but id feel even more frustrated if i had nothing more than a vague idea how it went down

2347,<|emo_anger|> I hate betting unders.
2348,<|emo_anger|> I hate to say this but we really need to put [NAME] into a Women’s refuge right away. You’re the reason the world’s population is 200% greater than it should be.

2350,<|emo_anger|> I hate that I like them

2357,<|emo_anger|> i am starting to feel really angry about this
2358,"<|emo_anger|> No, she was agitated. Yes, that's a problem. But why didn't you say something? "
2359,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is a MOTHERFUCKER
2360,<|emo_anger|> i always feel mad about that because there is just like 10% chance i could be wrong or what if i m wrong about something
2362,<|emo_anger|> i feel offended by the phrase god damn it
2363,<|emo_anger|> im feeling petty right now
2364,"<|emo_anger|> And if you think that the state should get involved, you're a moron."

2370,<|emo_anger|> I'll kill you if you do that again
2371,<|emo_anger|> Well that sucks then
2372,"<|emo_anger|> If you're going to say that about me, get out now."
2373,<|emo_anger|> You can't say that about cops. It's racist.
2374,"<|emo_anger|> And I said he should stay in Arizona, now I’m mad he can do this to me and my family, we need some help "
2375,<|emo_anger|> i feel quite annoyed by the people who comment on my blog saying they love it
2376,<|emo_anger|> i feel tortured by the thought of all my fans all calling me daddy
2377,<|emo_anger|> He’s a metahuman!!!!!!!
2378,<|emo_anger|> What the fuck
2379,<|emo_anger|> im feeling kind of bitchy
2380,"<|emo_anger|> You forgot to mention, it was *naked* molesting a child"
2381,<|emo_anger|> i feel like a heartless cowARD because in a matter of hours it all came to me and now im just pissed
2382,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is worse.... [NAME] is just bad.
2383,<|emo_anger|> Shut up [NAME] you cowards.
2384,"<|emo_anger|> I want to say [NAME] is the most toxic person you have ever worked with, because she was completely toxic to employees. "
2385,"<|emo_anger|> Your fault for caring about him, the mods are damn stupid now"
2387,<|emo_anger|> i feel so annoyed
2388,"<|emo_anger|> She’s still a child, you’re right, just a little bit of a wuss."
2389,<|emo_anger|> This is as hateful as the [NAME] poster is.
2390,<|emo_anger|> Damn these refs really fucking hate us.
2391,<|emo_anger|> This game is trash.

2394,<|emo_anger|> i am not feeling very bitter
2395,<|emo_anger|> You're an awful person.

2416,"<|emo_anger|> He already had a gun, don't stop now."
2417,<|emo_anger|> i feel jealous and impatient when i stop thinking more of the big things of this life then of my personal needs and goals but right this moment and am feeling the most important things
2418,<|emo_anger|> Yeah [NAME] is trash.
2420,<|emo_anger|> i started to feel mad of a person or a thing
2421,<|emo_anger|> This has been reposted so many times that it's become a meme.
2424,<|emo_anger|> i have no feeling that these women are cruel or manipulative
2425,<|emo_anger|> i feel irritated that all the attention is focused on the subject matter while in reality most of us are just interested in an entertaining story or amusing catch phrase
2426,<|emo_anger|> i feel frustrated but i cant shake that feeling because i know she will come back
2427,<|emo_anger|> She’s a liar.
2428,<|emo_anger|> i feel like this book is kinda trashy
2429,<|emo_anger|> i was so annoyed that he was coming over to my girl and i didnt care about him

2432,<|emo_anger|> I hate bet welcher
2433,"<|emo_anger|> Damn it, what a waste of plastic."
2434,<|emo_anger|> What a sad story.
2435,"<|emo_anger|> The ""N"" word put him off. I'm not the same person who would defend the racism and brutality of previous fascist movements."
2436,<|emo_anger|> i feel greedy for my own happiness
2437,<|emo_anger|> I fucking hate [NAME].
2439,"<|emo_anger|> > which ones do you hate, [NAME]?"
2440,<|emo_anger|> i mean i get to think and feel what s most obnoxious and disgusting about how disgusting i feel

2442,<|emo_anger|> i can tell you what i would feel was ungrateful about it all
2443,"<|emo_anger|> But it's stupid. We shouldn't tax anything, then give a tax cut to the rich so they can make even more shit."

2452,<|emo_anger|> i can feel my life getting more fucked up
2454,<|emo_anger|> It's a highly charged situation in that many members are very supportive as well.
2455,<|emo_anger|> This actually sounds a little paranoid

2457,<|emo_anger|> i feel greedy selfish and arrogant

2471,<|emo_anger|> > it's not a big change in law but it sure damn isn't a good thing
2472,<|emo_anger|> You're a awful human being.
2473,<|emo_anger|> She's a traitor to this country.
2475,<|emo_anger|> i could feel the hurt growing on me

2485,<|emo_anger|>  I'm getting old.
2486,<|emo_anger|> i am feeling really annoyed and upset and sad
2487,<|emo_anger|> oh lord i hate them
2488,<|emo_anger|> i feel like crying on the couch
2491,"<|emo_anger|> No, because they need us. If they stop asking us to donate, other charities will start to ask us too. If we don't donate soon, other people will stop asking us! "
2492,<|emo_anger|> i feel mad at them for not understanding my feelings a lot of days a japanese girl on rome said
2493,<|emo_anger|> He has such short comings.
2494,<|emo_anger|> I would like to see her face while she was screaming...
2495,<|emo_anger|> i was feeling like someone was insulted i couldnt help but turn that anger around a bit

2511,<|emo_anger|> i feel really wronged
2512,<|emo_anger|> i feel insulted because this is just my opinion
2514,"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is an interesting case. I hate him, but I also love him (arguably as much as some others)."

2528,<|emo_anger|> i still feel like an idiot for not taking them up on the offer to go back to spain for that summer
2529,"<|emo_anger|> I don't give a damn about the separation office, judge, police and fire. All are in the same fucking business."
2530,<|emo_anger|> i feel angry at the people of albuquerque
2531,"<|emo_anger|> He will, and the world will be devastated. We will pay with our lives"
2532,"<|emo_anger|> Fuck those callers, dumbass. "

2542,<|emo_anger|> i feel like a greedy little mooching off others without my permission and for no reason
2543,"<|emo_anger|> How stupid is this? He wants to keep control of the party? Shut up, [NAME]."
2544,<|emo_anger|> i feel so insulted by him

2552,<|emo_anger|> i feel just absolutely fucked up
2553,<|emo_anger|> im feeling pissed off
2554,<|emo_anger|> i am feeling very strongly that i should let go of the relationship with him so he can focus on himself
2555,<|emo_anger|> The worst is when it's something that has been said many times.
2556,<|emo_anger|> Shut up [NAME]!
2557,"<|emo_anger|> The worst is saying to someone ""I know how you feel i’m with you 100%""."
2558,"<|emo_anger|> I want to say I'm shocked. Disgusted, but not shocked."
2559,"<|emo_anger|> I had a guy yell something abusive towards me, I could have easily triggered him, this is a huge fucked up situation "
2561,"<|emo_anger|> I see a 30%+ interest rate, that's ridiculous."

2563,<|emo_anger|> i feel cold pain in my back and feet
2564,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is a greedy bastard...

2582,<|emo_anger|> But I hate America
2583,<|emo_anger|> i feel disgusted and hurt
2584,<|emo_anger|> I don't care. Stop fooling people.
2585,<|emo_anger|> i guess a lot of people got mad when i said that and started talking about it again

2587,<|emo_anger|> i am feeling very angry and angry i have to get that anger back
2588,"<|emo_anger|> So... You lost, huh? Why didn't you tell us?"

2593,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] I LOVE YOU
2594,"<|emo_anger|> Well damn, now you’ve made us look bad on your behalf. You’re pathetic and need to find a new job. Get the hell out. "
2595,<|emo_anger|> i feel so selfish
2597,"<|emo_anger|> This game is dying because toxic people like you ruin it. You're not playing it to kill people, you're playing it to have fun."
2598,<|emo_anger|> That one dude was out cold on the ground after he felled the grouch
2599,<|emo_anger|> This is an especially harsh take from a guy who apparently hasn’t read one of [NAME].
2600,<|emo_anger|> What is this fucking r/tworedditgate? They're the ones talking shit for the past month.
2601,<|emo_anger|> The most hated team in the nfl? The Chargers. Hardest to dislike a team since 1987.
2602,<|emo_anger|> It’s literally just been publically available since late 2016! Which only got us 3 months ago! /s
2604,<|emo_anger|> im feeling so petty i want to slap everyone
2605,<|emo_anger|> i feel just a bit grouchy that they will only leave while im in Europe at this time
2606,<|emo_anger|> i know this is a bit of a sensitive topic and if people come and think it is funny please let me know if im wrong or if it makes you feel offended it probably does
2607,<|emo_anger|> What it really shows is how dumb and stupid you are
2608,<|emo_anger|> Can we get the [NAME] out of here
2609,<|emo_anger|> i feel like that in some ways i feel very selfish in saying that because it s my job to help people see their own limitations sometimes
2611,<|emo_anger|> i did not expect to feel so disgusted and embarrassed that i could not stand looking at the sun the universe or god
2612,"<|emo_anger|> I am just angry that the top posts on Reddit in particular are more in line with my views than my parents'. That is to say, my parents have taught me that Reddit is a way to get attention, and that's why I hated it so much until I started. "
2613,"<|emo_anger|> Yes. All of my friends are horrible because they always say ""oh, it's like this, so it must be like this!"""

2619,<|emo_anger|> Fuck that.
2620,<|emo_anger|> i can feel my voice making an angry huff from the inside of my mouth now
2622,<|emo_anger|> What was that? You don't like your dad?
2623,<|emo_anger|> It's just more bullshit. All the jobs will be lost and you'll find people who'll gladly spend the next 8 years fighting for your life with worthless promises.
2624,"<|emo_anger|> Can you name one thing that [NAME] has done that is bad at the box office, aside from animesucks?"
2625,<|emo_anger|> He doesn't sound all that convinced that he deserves to be president.
2626,<|emo_anger|> Because we are mad.
2627,<|emo_anger|> i could see the eyes that were glazed over from the anger not even looking but instead furrowing in the sockets with each breath i took feeling his breath on my face and his breath in my neck and the same angry eyes that had been staring my ass in the face before had once again been there for the sake of being there
2628,<|emo_anger|> I swear Denver has the worst sports media personalities.
2629,<|emo_anger|> That's a really shitty way to spell [NAME]
2630,<|emo_anger|> i feel so frustrated and frustrated for the people who are not aware of the issues that are so important and the reasons why they are not involved and want to do it themselves
2631,<|emo_anger|> He was an obnoxious and obnoxious drunk. Get him drunk!
2632,<|emo_anger|> I love it when people assume things.
2633,<|emo_anger|> Oh fuck off. Let people have fun if they want.
2634,<|emo_anger|> im feeling very greedy
2635,"<|emo_anger|> The problem is, you cant give them two choices. You can only make them suck in his spirit."
2636,<|emo_anger|> Lol I'm more than willing to bet he doesn't even like his mom as a person.
2637,<|emo_anger|> Damn do we.
2638,<|emo_anger|> The monster!
2639,"<|emo_anger|> And by the way, ""dying"" is a terrible thing to do. ""Dying"" is just as bad. "
2640,<|emo_anger|> Oh my god Del Monico I can’t believe you beat him
2641,<|emo_anger|> i don t even make them feel unwelcome at all
2642,<|emo_anger|> That is extremely disrespectful to your parents.
2643,<|emo_anger|> You're an idiot.
2644,<|emo_anger|> He is a disgusting democratsuck.
2645,"<|emo_anger|> I would like to say that about ten times, and it really bothered me, until I realized i'm just a regular asshole. "
2646,<|emo_anger|> I really hate when people say that because I play a lot of PoE I don't want any more Heart of Thorns.
2647,<|emo_anger|> You were a very bad boyfriend. You should be ashamed. She deserved it for what she did to you.
2648,<|emo_anger|> Who the hell thought he didn’t get it? I didn’t even see the fine
2649,<|emo_anger|> The best thing about the Liberals right now are all the ludicrous attacks on [NAME] and [NAME] that are coming out of B.C.
2651,<|emo_anger|> I hate [NAME] for fucking years.
2652,<|emo_anger|> That’s not an okay argument you ignorant piece of shit. You’re not even saying that [NAME] is worse as a person then [NAME].
2653,<|emo_anger|> This is worse than a movie poster
2654,<|emo_anger|> i feel like a heartless person because i have the ability to understand people on a level even i cannot relate to
2655,<|emo_anger|> i feel that the more isolated you get the less likely it is that youll ever have someone else's feelings or needs met
2657,<|emo_anger|> i dont give a shit how good one feels when it s a bad one not something one is passionate about
2658,<|emo_anger|> Shut up.
2659,<|emo_anger|> i go off on some of people who i feel are obnoxious and irate and out of line and so on but its just a matter of just getting past them when its so damn hard to come by
2660,<|emo_anger|> Well fuck off.

2667,<|emo_anger|> *meows in delight at the thought of eating the delicious flesh off a Crab*
2668,<|emo_anger|> i can feel that s still a bitter feeling after all
2669,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] fucked up his face like that
2670,"<|emo_anger|> The comment in question was against theists, it was a hate sub and all that."
2671,<|emo_anger|> i feel a bit rude about being so close to her husband and our friends
2673,<|emo_anger|> i feel like if i am going to get pissed cause the team is doing poorly i want it to be in my own hands
2675,<|emo_anger|> I dont care if you dont care about my feelings or if you think I d give a shit
2676,<|emo_anger|> i don t feel like i d been rude
2677,<|emo_anger|> i feel more impatient and more stressed

2693,<|emo_anger|> She should go to HELL
2694,<|emo_anger|> What a fucking idiotic thing to say. Fuck off.
2695,<|emo_anger|> i feel selfish for not wanting to see another relationship than that one just the way i do
2696,<|emo_anger|> What? What's so funny about that?
2698,<|emo_anger|> i feel really annoyed at myself for not taking more risks and trusting more customers
2699,<|emo_anger|> i feel the anger and frustration from him when he talks about himself as if he can write another blog or anything
2700,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] a class traitor.
2701,<|emo_anger|> i hate him and he is only making me feel as if we do not matter to you
2702,<|emo_anger|> And in this climate there's no need to be embarrassed about calling some women harassers or creeps.
2703,<|emo_anger|> i was feeling really angry and upset at the world but instead of feeling angry and upset i was feeling positive and optimistic
2704,<|emo_anger|> The irony of him saying things like this to people he hates is hilarious.
2705,"<|emo_anger|> [NAME] damn it, karen"
2706,<|emo_anger|> Damn i had to look that up
2707,"<|emo_anger|> How dare you mock [NAME], he is a true hero of our times!"

2709,<|emo_anger|> i feel a little bit disgusted but i am going to do my best to live up to that point
2710,<|emo_anger|> It’s a fucking meme

2718,<|emo_anger|> i feel so fucked up
2719,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is a dirty berk. That is all there is to him. Do your damn job and stop playing along with him.

2729,<|emo_anger|> I took a picture of their grave... DAMN!
2731,<|emo_anger|> i always thought it was really important to me how i had to make everyone feel superior and superior to me because that is a very valued quality I found in the highest value beings in that life system

2735,<|emo_anger|> i feel like i am just a bitter person
2736,<|emo_anger|> i will do anything i feel like doing even if it means hurting someone
2737,<|emo_anger|> What a weird post omg
2738,<|emo_anger|> The worst thing about this video is how many people complain the liberals are more angry and frustrated than the right.
2740,<|emo_anger|> I knew it was stupid when they all said they were shocked and surprised by the [RELIGION] decision.
2741,<|emo_anger|> i am a woman and i feel so insulted by your username and your attitude
2742,<|emo_anger|> i feel more grumpy as the weeks go by but im also trying to stay positive

2745,<|emo_anger|> >I want to get that damn [NAME] off my back...
2746,"<|emo_anger|> You are a mean person, and don't know what you're talking about."
2747,<|emo_anger|> im feeling really petty today because that ill happen again soon
2748,<|emo_anger|> That'd be sexual harassment.
2749,"<|emo_anger|> Yes, it absolutely sucks when we're wrong all the time."
2750,"<|emo_anger|> i feel this way is probably because i was only brought up with a thick skin, a set of eyes that would shut down anyone who made me feel wronged, and very little sympathy for the common people"
2752,<|emo_anger|> im feeling a little more bitchy about it all
2753,<|emo_anger|> Why would a guy want to fuck a dog? And it’s not even his fucking house either?
2754,"<|emo_anger|> That's just greedy of you to use your greedy nature to manipulate people, the church doesn't do that."
2755,<|emo_anger|> Who the hell thought he was still alive.
2756,<|emo_anger|> i feel extremely jealous

2762,<|emo_anger|> im feeling a bit grouchy this morning because i dont have a big enough reason to feel anything other than a little melancholy about it
2763,<|emo_anger|> im feeling bitchy and angry i just don t feel like being that girl

2765,<|emo_anger|> i feel just greedy and greedy is just selfish is just greedy
2766,<|emo_anger|> The saddest part is how popular Faze is in Germany. He hates that. Poor guy.
2767,<|emo_anger|> i do feel irritated by the way the class is set up
2768,<|emo_anger|> i feel that they hated him because he liked to talk about things so much and they were afraid that he will start talking about things because sometimes he says funny things

2777,<|emo_anger|> Fuck you too.
2778,<|emo_anger|> The problem I have is that you don't see any of that. You are so smug

2783,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] that looks like such a terrible idea.
2784,<|emo_anger|> But it's so fucking stupid
2785,<|emo_anger|> i feel so hated by that guy thats like a little god who im trying so hard to believe can even understand i can feel his pain
2787,<|emo_anger|> oh so it’s not a matter of taste but what happens when you try to eat it
2788,<|emo_anger|> That's the worst possible outcome
2789,<|emo_anger|> Because hate is a social construct?
2790,<|emo_anger|> That was such a terrible open shot....
2791,<|emo_anger|> i just want to be happy and feel like a valued member of society
2792,<|emo_anger|> I didn't think that came out right

2811,<|emo_anger|> I feel so bad for [NAME]. He didn’t get the floor time. [NAME] isn‘t going to get the floor time either.
2812,"<|emo_anger|> Damn it, bud."
2813,<|emo_anger|> That was so stupid. You would think that if you didn't like the starting field that you'd at least like to at least give us some starting field. What a moron
2815,<|emo_anger|> i feel more vicious
2816,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is an absolute monster.
2817,<|emo_anger|> i will still not leave the place
2820,<|emo_anger|> What the fuck?
2821,<|emo_anger|> i don t want to spend my life feeling guilty and guilty is not what i want to do

2830,<|emo_anger|> i will feel disgusted not knowing what it was
2831,"<|emo_anger|> I really need to hear this, I’ve become quite disillusioned with the Aussie system recently thanks to this idiots ridiculous kicking stuff."
2832,<|emo_anger|> Why is this making me so mad?
2833,<|emo_anger|> No fucking clue

2859,"<|emo_anger|> Damn it, what a shame that online sellers don't have presence here, I'd love to recommend them to people "
2861,<|emo_anger|> The real goal here is to get [NAME] fired because he is a moron. You're just making this up.
2862,<|emo_anger|> My favorite way is on a hot dog. It's so fucking disgusting.
2863,<|emo_anger|> I hate fags
2864,<|emo_anger|> Oooh sorry you're coming off the wrong page. No offense but you're a weirdo
2865,<|emo_anger|> And this is why we suck. Cause we actually try to be strategy.

2868,"<|emo_anger|> Oh, damn it!"
2869,<|emo_anger|> im feeling a bit greedy tonight im going to go for it i think ill give it as a gift to him

2876,<|emo_anger|> i feel petty and selfish for even wanting to feel that way
2877,<|emo_anger|> You smug fuck
2878,"<|emo_anger|> I like how some people can't accept a changing environment without either changing their mindset to one that excuses their behavior, or making the shift themselves"

2888,<|emo_anger|> I will have my revenge today.
2889,<|emo_anger|> i feel really disgusted now
2890,<|emo_anger|> ive been feeling a little bit dissatisfied with how little support i really have
2891,<|emo_anger|> I hope you realize that the reason you're upset is because you thought an angry fan in a t-shirt could be an asshole.
2892,<|emo_anger|> i feel so pissed off that i want to turn around
2893,<|emo_anger|> I don't care what people say. I love going to a bar or a restaurant and just being in that environment.

2904,"<|emo_anger|> > You're a horrible human being. How do you become a monster though? I've said it before, and it won't work, because you're a monster."

2915,"<|emo_anger|> > And by that I mean that she still has two children out of wedlock who she can't leave the house with, which is weird since she works part time."
2916,<|emo_anger|> i feel that the most innocent and vulnerable people would be offended if they heard such lines
2917,<|emo_anger|> But it's cheaper & faster & better! (And better fitting as well)
2918,<|emo_anger|> Sooooo you don't actually want equality? Cool bruh

2926,"<|emo_anger|> > I hate people like this. I would never, ever, ever support a fascist, even if it was [NAME]. "
2927,<|emo_anger|> Oh and now vini is down
2930,<|emo_anger|> This is a gross overreaction. I think you're just overreacting; I'd just call what you're doing pathetic.
2931,"<|emo_anger|> I thought they were getting divorce for not wanting to pay the $600+ in alimony. Damn, they were scumbags."
2932,<|emo_anger|> He’s not [NAME] he’s Justus

2937,<|emo_anger|> How dare you!?! /s
2938,<|emo_anger|> I want to fucking die
2939,<|emo_anger|> Overeating in public has become so much of a red flag for my city to score on me to be a bumbling idiot.
2940,"<|emo_anger|> Lol, don’t you know the actual law? Not the bullshit ""I disagree with [NAME]"" stuff. "
2941,<|emo_anger|> No! That's horrible news!..for Galaxy fans lol
2942,<|emo_anger|> I'd rather do the actual work and ruin my career than play the part.
2943,<|emo_anger|> im feeling more angry than ever

2948,"<|emo_anger|> So, yeah, you probably don't have any standing or any moral strength to complain about that."
2949,<|emo_anger|> I don’t care about [NAME]. Get [NAME] and [NAME] and sign [NAME] this offseason then we can all forget about [NAME] and [NAME]
2950,"<|emo_anger|> That video was deleted, the hostess was given a bad rating, and the comments section was abuzz with angry posts.. it was a very poor showing of its own stupidity"

2963,"<|emo_anger|> Your husband has no right to beat you and get away with it. If he wanted to, he'd have you jail for assault."
2964,<|emo_anger|> Lol you fucking moron
2965,<|emo_anger|> I would never say that. The world is a cruel place. Everyone is.
2966,<|emo_anger|> I get that. You feel so mad for a year-and-a-half straight because it didn't happen?
2967,"<|emo_anger|> The real problem here, are them so fucking stupid they think there are 100% of the population that are insane."
2968,<|emo_anger|> Yes that's how I got banned

2976,<|emo_anger|> im feeling slightly grouchy today
2977,<|emo_anger|> He is going to want to call bullshit on everything you say now. Don’t let that happen. You’re going insane for not listening to advice already
2979,<|emo_anger|> i should feel insulted because i havent said those things with anyone
2980,<|emo_anger|> This is awful.
2981,"<|emo_anger|> Well I actually don't think so. She seems really virtuous but I hate her too. That being said, I hope she does well somehow"
2982,<|emo_anger|> Man I love reddit.
2983,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] was the worst Of any sports team Unis!!!
2985,<|emo_anger|> It's pretty amazing that even these people believe in a god of reason and logic.
2987,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is a FUCKING MANNER as fuck
2988,<|emo_anger|> i got to a point where i didnt feel like i was being punished because i wasnt smart enough

3023,<|emo_anger|> i was feeling cranky and was irritated by things that irked me like people asking people to smile when they re not smiling
3024,<|emo_anger|> How is that hate motivated? Because some hate [NAME] and hate racial minority groups. It's all hatred.
3025,<|emo_anger|> i feel so hated by them
3026,"<|emo_anger|> ""Why everyone hurts me?"""

3039,<|emo_anger|> i actually feel insulted and hurt by this
3040,<|emo_anger|> This is a stupid charge.
3042,<|emo_anger|> My biggest fear is catching and holding his head in my hands while screaming OCW.
3043,"<|emo_anger|> No, I'm talking about a horribly inadequate definition I'll never understand and completely misrepresent the purpose behind."
3044,<|emo_anger|> i feel like it is rude to say the same things to so many people at once i feel insulted and insulted
3045,<|emo_anger|> i feel greedy in doing so
3046,<|emo_anger|> So sorry! I hope the school district takes your allegations seriously and takes you seriously enough that you get out of there. Good luck
3048,<|emo_anger|> i feel quite petty in this
3049,<|emo_anger|> It never ceases to amaze me how many [NAME] and [NAME] are onto him but he's all attention.
3050,<|emo_anger|> The problem is your age difference. He's 30. You're a weirdo at best.

3064,<|emo_anger|> i would feel completely betrayed or insulted
3065,<|emo_anger|> Why wont i just fucking die

3073,"<|emo_anger|> Damn it, [NAME]! We were right there with you!"
3075,<|emo_anger|> Well damn I am just happy for this thread lol. Now my sadness hits harder
3076,"<|emo_anger|> I would say the same thing, it's weird and creepy but also really sad, imagine if that ever happened to you! "
3078,"<|emo_anger|> Because that's what you do in a game of hide andseek, that's how you get people to come out crying. "
3079,<|emo_anger|> i feel like a heartless bitch
3080,<|emo_anger|> i go up to him and feel insulted by him
3081,<|emo_anger|> I did hate the [NAME] from the olden days!
3082,"<|emo_anger|> I'm gonna say this as a felloweltas fuckboi who is also [NAME], so fuck it. Fuck em all"
3083,"<|emo_anger|> i didnt feel too bitter or sarcastic about it all, if i feel that way it is fine"
3084,<|emo_anger|> He lost the bet. Why did he get upset then? He lost a bet that’s all he deserved for being so rude about it
3085,<|emo_anger|> Damn. Your new normal. Sorry for the rude comment but I have a bad feeling about this.
3086,"<|emo_anger|> You poor, barefoot bitch."
3087,<|emo_anger|> i do feel so petty right now
3088,<|emo_anger|> i will just say that i feel a little mad that we are supporting the school for another season but i actually feel like a moron for doing it
3089,<|emo_anger|> i feel absolutely greedy
3090,<|emo_anger|> Don't use fat as an insult.
3091,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] has lost it

3098,<|emo_anger|> Holy shit thats some shit right there
3099,<|emo_anger|> Yeah but that poor janitor isn't going to get any shit either.
3100,<|emo_anger|> The only bad thing I've seen of her is that she hates [NAME] so much.
3101,<|emo_anger|> The only other option I have is him leaving and it would suck being a Nets fan
3102,<|emo_anger|> i can say that i feel rather mad now
3105,<|emo_anger|> i feel envious of y'all who live there
3106,<|emo_anger|> The whole post is a load of cranky old shite.
3107,"<|emo_anger|> The new ""I'm a parent now! therefore I must be cruel!"" bit is particularly cruel."
3108,<|emo_anger|> i feel stressed or angry
3109,<|emo_anger|> He’s creepy
3110,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is a selfish prick. Just stop.
3111,"<|emo_anger|> ""We have to stop having babies because there's gonna be babies"" "
3112,<|emo_anger|> i was really feeling petty today so i decided to go out for a walk
3113,<|emo_anger|> Fuck you i thought i was in California
3115,<|emo_anger|> i feel so damn infuriated im almost sick of everyone and then at the end of the evening my family gets winded but im not mad
3117,<|emo_anger|> The fucking worst game ever made by [NAME]

3131,<|emo_anger|> But he's not! He *cries!* during the intermission!
3132,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] damn it we must find a way to stop being a POS
3133,<|emo_anger|> The main reason I have kids is because I couldn't have. Now I wish I could but I'm broke like a fuckin bird

3135,<|emo_anger|> This made me sad
3136,<|emo_anger|> i feel so mad i feel like i m going to kill someone
3137,<|emo_anger|> i don t feel angry
3138,<|emo_anger|> That's the worst possible outcomes from her story.... she had tried the pills and nothing worked for her...
3139,<|emo_anger|> im going to tell you how i feel that it s wrong and ill make you aware of it
3141,<|emo_anger|> That sub is fucking retarded
3142,<|emo_anger|> Because people hate freedom.
3143,"<|emo_anger|> I have no idea what he is on about, but I'll gladly upvote any thread with posts like this. I hate reddit."
3144,<|emo_anger|> Because it's news? Fuck off.

3149,<|emo_anger|> i feel really selfish and petty too
3150,<|emo_anger|> You don't love yourself enough... or your family... /s
3151,<|emo_anger|> The real villains in this story are the parents who put their kids through all this.
3152,<|emo_anger|> i feel angry with myself because i thought things for a while and maybe because i still am trying for new feelings i am a little disappointed

3160,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] fuck those creeps
3161,<|emo_anger|> i hated feeling like an idiot for hating people but i hated myself for not being able to change anyone
3162,<|emo_anger|> If I end up killing someone this way my remorse will not be for anything short of a violent mouthfull
3163,"<|emo_anger|> You can't change someone's mind, you merely shift their perspective, it isn't an opinion."
3165,<|emo_anger|> She's a liar as hell
3167,<|emo_anger|> Fucking hate the rangers
3168,<|emo_anger|> i feel i was quite rude when it came out but it was never very serious

3189,<|emo_anger|> i have found that i am just as stressed out by other people on the internet as i am when i am having a horrible day at school feeling angry and frustrated by the world around me and just generally being miserable as hell
3190,<|emo_anger|> i can t wait to tell someone that i feel tortured in my sleep like an annoying spirit squirrel trying to suck the precious sap from my tree
3191,<|emo_anger|> i feel selfish but i really want the best for my two girls yuuki and dasmine

3212,<|emo_anger|> i have to say i was quite excited but now i just feel mad
3213,<|emo_anger|> I think it’s fair to state that the original trilogy has both gotten much worse over the course of both series.
3214,<|emo_anger|> i feel a little disgusted that my son does things that are even more disgusting than mine but i guess i will move on
3215,<|emo_anger|> i feel like its rude to take the heat out on someone by saying youre not interested
3217,<|emo_anger|> Shut up nerd
3218,<|emo_anger|> Fuck [NAME] for blocking funding for this [NAME] stop
3219,"<|emo_anger|> Wow that's a burden, I'm sorry."

3221,<|emo_anger|> i feel really selfish and self indulgent
3222,<|emo_anger|> i feel angry about it
3223,<|emo_anger|> i feel extremely envious of him
3224,<|emo_anger|> Not to be the only thing on the news to upset [NAME]. Well done.

3228,<|emo_anger|> i feel stressed and distracted
3229,"<|emo_anger|> That sucks, good luck next time!"
3230,<|emo_anger|> Your only sin is trying to be nice to someone with depression.

3240,<|emo_anger|> > the only thing that you should hate is [NAME] himself.
3241,"<|emo_anger|> A year ago, I would have. It still sucks."
3242,<|emo_anger|> i feel like i had to ask this but im afraid i will give the wrong response to anyone because after all ive said and done is just the last line from my own post
3243,<|emo_anger|> The fact that the suspect is an addict is a real red flag
3244,<|emo_anger|> *Gags on you* *thief* *eyeroll*
3245,"<|emo_anger|> No, the real root of everything is religion and culture. That's why I don’t see a fucking problem with [RELIGION] and [RELIGION] isn’t a bad thing."
3246,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is a very dangerous woman.
3247,<|emo_anger|> That's just the worst cover of all time
3249,<|emo_anger|> i don t feel resentful towards them just because i thought that with each passing day that they should know more about me so that they felt the need to come to me
3250,"<|emo_anger|>  I didn't see the hand holding the gun in the picture. Was just guessing, but it was definitely agitated."
3251,<|emo_anger|> Damn my mother hates [NAME].
3252,<|emo_anger|> i get the feeling you might be dissatisfied with my performance

3260,"<|emo_anger|> This, my favorite! ""Why everyone hurts me?"""
3261,<|emo_anger|> I hated going to parties. Party culture was gross and I felt extremely awkward.
3262,<|emo_anger|> i still feel that the people there are totally against this but i know that this isnt just me
3263,<|emo_anger|> They are a disgrace to the species
3264,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is an unwelcome sight in Wargamearia.

3280,<|emo_anger|> i started to feel dissatisfied with my job
3281,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is a fucking MAN. Get the fuck out now
3282,<|emo_anger|> i feel very petty and selfish today
3283,<|emo_anger|> i feel less hateful because there are still some good people out there and i know that the internet is a hive of discontent
3284,<|emo_anger|> i began by saying that for the present i feel envious and guilty
3285,<|emo_anger|> im feeling a little envious as of late and more than just thankful
3286,<|emo_anger|> What a fucking cunt.
3288,<|emo_anger|> This is the motherfucker!
3289,"<|emo_anger|> Well damn, that's just another example of how ""centrist"" media have absolutely no clue about any actual history or issues going on in the world!"
3290,<|emo_anger|> i still feel so petty and wronged
3291,<|emo_anger|> > What the fuck is going on at the school? There's a good chance you're just a conspiracy theorist hogging their reddit feed
3292,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] you moron
3293,<|emo_anger|> I can't be the only one who’s surprised by this too
3294,<|emo_anger|> i still feel frustrated by the way our society treats girls and women
3295,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is an angry elf! He won't let [NAME] be angry because he loves him!
3296,<|emo_anger|> i feel so petty right now
3297,<|emo_anger|> i hate it when i feel like that but what ever happened to me in which case i am just pissing away another year on my life because i have fucked up my head and body
3298,<|emo_anger|> You're a horrible person.
3299,<|emo_anger|> This is so infuriating from Day 1. What a trainwreck. I'm so sorry.
3300,"<|emo_anger|> She needs a serious opinion. Also apparently, she doesn't believe in facts or reason. "
3301,<|emo_anger|> im feeling rather petty right now
3302,<|emo_anger|> i was feeling very stressed out and very annoyed with my mother and her obsession with her books
3303,<|emo_anger|> im tired of feeling like im hated but im happy i live on this earth and im not alone
3304,<|emo_anger|> Yeah fuck you too okay
3305,"<|emo_anger|> Damn it, [NAME]!"
3306,<|emo_anger|> im just feeling cold
3307,<|emo_anger|> You have no shame.
3308,<|emo_anger|> That is an action movie star. You should really get a divorce.
3310,<|emo_anger|> i just feel like i really hated them
3311,<|emo_anger|> i can feel my stomach growls and i start to be extremely irritable
3312,<|emo_anger|> Fucking fuck. I'm so sad this is happening to you.
3313,<|emo_anger|> i feel a little rebellious about it but dont make me an asshole
3314,"<|emo_anger|> What, they don't pay $9 for a 16oz Canache?"
3315,"<|emo_anger|> I swear, they've gotten worse. Get the hell out now. And call me a sellout if I don't see it sooner."
3316,<|emo_anger|> > You've made your Reddit account > look like a bloody toddler's toy! You know why we don't like this? Because it's true!
3317,<|emo_anger|> i was feeling really bitter i didn't feel like a queen anymore and that left me feeling a lot of the time
3318,<|emo_anger|> i feel as though im being quite rude to him
3319,<|emo_anger|> How dare you put x on the same level as [NAME] and [NAME] [NAME]..
3320,"<|emo_anger|> Yeah just throw it away, you useless piece of shit!"
3321,<|emo_anger|> i know all you people know that is the main reason not to be violent because you feel like violent agressive violent agressively aggressive violent aggressive toward people as you see them as enemy to the divine and your superior being for that matter and yet you re the biggest killers in the world for this very reason
3322,<|emo_anger|> i feel a little angry just thinking about it
3323,<|emo_anger|> i got the feeling that maybe her parents didn t want him to tell her the consequences of her decision
3324,<|emo_anger|> i just feel so selfish and selfish but i want to show her it doesnt make her any sense
3326,<|emo_anger|>  it was done at a party and the whole town got riled up about it.
3327,<|emo_anger|> i feel just a little insulted
3329,<|emo_anger|> i had a feeling she was going to be quite annoyed by all of the bullshit

3332,<|emo_anger|> She still missed...
3333,<|emo_anger|> i feel angry inside because i know that im going to stop trying and stop fighting
3334,<|emo_anger|> Fuck nagy shock-faced rn
3335,<|emo_anger|> This is disgusting. This is the kind of policy that led to the rise of ISIS.
3336,<|emo_anger|> i feel insulted that most people would want a video that only shows me dancing to the beat and not the music
3337,<|emo_anger|> That's... pretty clear cut they're not going to help you with your issues.
3341,<|emo_anger|> >the people who made that up are either ignorant or playing along. Not really a new thing with y'all though.
3342,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] has been extremely good for us as a gunner at long range. I’m not sure [NAME] is even close to being their WR.
3343,<|emo_anger|> i hate feeling this way to be insulted i mean i dont want to be insulted everytime ive been or said anything
3344,<|emo_anger|> I will never not like [NAME]
3345,"<|emo_anger|> You were not ""calling for the genocide against anti-Semites"". You were calling for the genocide against anti-Semites because they're anti-Semites."
3346,<|emo_anger|> i get the feeling he was pretty damn rude to me
3347,<|emo_anger|> Yeah look at that. Where the fuck is that t shirt?
3349,"<|emo_anger|> Well, that and the 4th of July are my vacation from work. Fuck I need a vacation from work."
3350,<|emo_anger|> You should be more pissed off about the [NAME] than this.
3352,"<|emo_anger|> We don't pay shit. Also, I'm not going to the games to watch this crap. I'm going to the restaurant. It'll be better. Gotta love the Chargers"
3353,<|emo_anger|> i could understand some of you feeling so hurt and upset because this is your first post that directly insulted or opposed to the catholic church
3354,<|emo_anger|> i can feel my flesh aching
3355,<|emo_anger|> i feel greedy for these days
3356,<|emo_anger|> Oh [NAME] it's back

3364,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] I HATE those.
3365,<|emo_anger|> i feel very offended and angry
3367,<|emo_anger|> Get that car back from them yknow they stole it 🤔
3368,"<|emo_anger|> Damn, I would've called the cops on him for force. That was illegal."
3369,<|emo_anger|> It was the worst possible outcome
3370,"<|emo_anger|> Because we hate them and wish them harm, and they give us gifts in return."
3371,<|emo_anger|> They've also gotten better at finding ways to cheat.
3372,<|emo_anger|> im feeling so fucking irritated now
3373,"<|emo_anger|> They said they were taking the children into government care, so they are freaking out now."
3374,<|emo_anger|> This is a fake twitter handle
3375,<|emo_anger|> i feel more cold
3376,<|emo_anger|> i feel like im being ridiculous again
3377,<|emo_anger|> Because you're being a dumbass.
3378,<|emo_anger|> This person is a cancer in our society.
3380,<|emo_anger|> i feel really greedy now
3381,"<|emo_anger|> > Also, why do I hate [NAME] so much? He did nothing wrong, he just took the league by storm with his weird defense and terrible special teams. "
3382,<|emo_anger|> I want to die!
3383,<|emo_anger|> i feel so petty being the first one to say that
3384,"<|emo_anger|> I don't mind the odd shooter, but hate the unnecessary role reversal."
3386,<|emo_anger|> Well damn if he isn’t a moron.
3387,<|emo_anger|> How dare anyone tell you what you can and can't do with your money.
3390,"<|emo_anger|> I've heard that joke before, and it gets old, tbh."
3393,<|emo_anger|> Fuck you for enjoying music
3394,<|emo_anger|> But it's always like it's really really hard to tell.
3395,<|emo_anger|> i feel like my parents think im being selfish and saying i have no control
3396,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] is a very bad defender
3398,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] doesn't deserve it. Stop saying ignorant and false things about him.
3399,<|emo_anger|> And that's how you get 9/11 truthers who believe the 9/11 truthers are a bunch of liars or conspiracy theorists.
3400,<|emo_anger|> He is the god responsible for climate change. Stop being so stupid and accept your reality.
3401,<|emo_anger|> oh is that it
3402,<|emo_anger|> i thought it was an incredible idea and i thought you felt the same way thats why i asked
3404,<|emo_anger|> Damn she was a bitch
3406,<|emo_anger|> My new favourite bromance
3407,<|emo_anger|> i feel like there s an awful lot of people that dont like me
3408,"<|emo_anger|> >tf you suck"" for the simple sake of ""saying something without evidence"" is child abuse. OP should go to HELL"
3409,<|emo_anger|> Yeah I hate to say this but having the thought of cheating on your significant other with a guy you met online is way more horrifying than not leaving and never meeting him.
3410,<|emo_anger|> i feel a little petty about myself
3411,<|emo_anger|> i feel really angry at my husband
3412,<|emo_anger|> i feel insulted by your ignorance i feel you should go and learning how to fly a kite
3414,"<|emo_anger|> He’s worse than [NAME] bro, I hate him so much"
3416,<|emo_anger|> i had been feeling quite impatient for some reason or another so having my lunch a short distance away from him and him not being able to get out the back door for a couple of days had made me feel pretty cranky for a bit
3417,<|emo_anger|> I was just thinking about how much I hate OkC for the last year. People who are mad about the status quo are idiots. Everyone wants to be free but its a bit of a shame.
3420,<|emo_anger|> I was petrified...
3421,<|emo_anger|> im feeling cold im feeling hot
3422,<|emo_anger|> This is the scariest thing I've ever read on this sub. Not because he's a terrible [NAME] but because he's a terrible human being.
3423,<|emo_anger|> i feel violent because i want to go away from people
3424,<|emo_anger|> i was feeling rather frustrated
3425,<|emo_anger|> So much fake news oh my gosh
3426,"<|emo_anger|> No, instead, she could look at her watch, tell you that she won't be able to buy any more presents until three hours before her birthday, and not even then."
3427,<|emo_anger|> This is stupid
3428,<|emo_anger|> i feel slightly annoyed
3429,<|emo_anger|> The third period was the worst I have ever seen. There were someicks whooped over him and the refs didnt call that.
3430,<|emo_anger|> How dare you question the virgin birth! /s
3431,"<|emo_anger|> That's a shame, for those of us who are based in the western world it may be the easy way out."
3433,<|emo_anger|> i feel a bit grumpy for that
3434,<|emo_anger|> i started to feel wronged
3436,<|emo_anger|> im feeling extremely petty right now
3437,<|emo_anger|> i feel quite grumpy and annoyed and I really want to get out and get some work done but i know you cant tell that
3438,<|emo_anger|> What in the actual fuck.
3439,<|emo_anger|> Oh fuck off.
3440,<|emo_anger|> i had a feeling i was going to be wrong
3441,<|emo_anger|> i will tell them something will break and when it does my feelings just get hurt
3442,<|emo_anger|> i feel insulted and hurt that i am to be this way
3443,<|emo_anger|> i do not feel that i am selfish
3444,<|emo_anger|> I hate going to parties. The worst.�
3445,<|emo_anger|> i see him i feel disgusted
3446,<|emo_anger|> [NAME] how awful.
3447,<|emo_anger|> But it would be so terrible if all the time they gave their families to keep everyone fed was wasted on bullshit.
3448,<|emo_anger|> i feel so hate filled so lonely and so i want to live with my feelings not fake ones
3449,<|emo_anger|> i feel this way because my mom was a violent criminal and is still a violent criminal
3450,"<|emo_anger|> [NAME], you fucking moron."
3451,<|emo_anger|> i feel like im a violent hot mess
3452,<|emo_anger|> i am feeling really bitchy and irritable right now but that is to be expected
3453,<|emo_anger|> Just shut up about your problems you cuck.
3454,<|emo_anger|> *fists u* u *heads butt* u
3455,<|emo_anger|> But why would you go ahead and call your own son a bastard though? It's the most obvious thing ever to come out of any subreddit.
3456,<|emo_anger|> Holy shit I’m stupid
3457,<|emo_anger|> i started feeling angry at myself
3458,<|emo_anger|> It was my understanding it was for a kids birthday party. I was wrong. :(
3459,<|emo_anger|> The fucking worst thing that can happen to a human is to intentionally create and maintain a climate that is hostile to humanity. That's so cruel.
3462,<|emo_anger|> Your opinion doesn't matter now do you act like a grownup? You're a child.
3464,<|emo_anger|> Damn you!
3465,<|emo_anger|> im feeling very petty and selfish for doing something so petty and selfish but now that we have peace what are we talking about
3466,<|emo_anger|> Can that idiot just shut his stupid mouth for a second?
3467,<|emo_anger|> The fuck?! He’s not even 30! What the hell was [NAME] thinking with a 31 year old? *eyeroll*
3468,<|emo_anger|> i feel so fucking petty
3469,<|emo_anger|> i feel greedy about everything right now which is making me really upset about my life right now
3470,<|emo_anger|> i feel like i cant defend my work
3471,<|emo_anger|> i do not feel like i am not being stubborn or rebellious like they say
3473,"<|emo_anger|> I am not surprised that people can be convinced that gun control is the ""right"" thing to do."
3474,<|emo_anger|> What does the- actual image- mean? I’ve been meaning to ask.
3475,"<|emo_anger|> No, not at all!"
3476,"<|emo_anger|> Just take my baby and get out of here with this frick nass bullshit about ""standing up for your rights"" "
3477,<|emo_anger|> i still feel disgusted by myself when i think of it
3478,<|emo_anger|> But the government is gonna be broke after that.
3479,<|emo_anger|> i feel disgusted of what this world has become
3480,<|emo_anger|> i feel really angry and frustrated right now because we have this plan
3481,"<|emo_anger|> ""Hey look I played the lottery and got fucked""."
3482,<|emo_anger|> i feel a bit dissatisfied and sad
3483,<|emo_anger|> If I were to die tomorrow it would be by my own hand.
3485,<|emo_anger|> i had felt mad and even angry at something or anyone for all of the time i felt it was not right for my body to feel this way
3486,<|emo_anger|> You have to be a fucking idiot to come up with that as an argument.
3487,"<|emo_anger|> I just saw a video about how to store your food in your car, delicious! My next post will be a video on how to store your food for your next vacation! "
3488,<|emo_anger|> This is the single dumbest thing I've seen on his YouTube channel so far
3490,<|emo_anger|> Fuck [NAME] for continuing to give her a platform
3491,<|emo_anger|> The best bit!! Its the 20 seconds where it shows the man being mauled!!
3492,<|emo_anger|> i feel very agitated and feeling very irritated right now
3493,<|emo_anger|> i felt rather envious of the fact that she was going to the same school as him and because of the coincidence that she also had to go cross school that day
3494,<|emo_anger|> i feel like i ve been beaten up by the police since this morning
3495,<|emo_anger|> i am feeling stressed because it does not look like i am running away
3497,<|emo_anger|> ive been feeling pretty bitchy lately in general
3498,"<|emo_anger|> Fuck you no, it’s in your birthday. Birthday is when you **are** a person."
3499,<|emo_anger|> i want to get to know my own self so that i can take the time to feel what im feeling i don't want to see that anger and sadness and self hate just in my own life just in the space i am in
