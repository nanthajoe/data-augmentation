24,<|emo_sad|> I feel you. I hope you have a happy ending.
25,<|emo_sad|> The death of capitalism is inevitable. The only hope is to bring down the ownership of capital through a simple redistribution of wealth.

41,<|emo_sad|> i felt that way for so many years i was so unhappy with myself that i went to therapy and spent a lot of my life trying to control my emotions so i didn t feel that way with my husband and i loved his company as a result
42,<|emo_sad|> i didnt feel guilty for crying i didnt weep or anything
43,<|emo_sad|> i feel burdened all the time with this

55,<|emo_sad|> i feel so regretful but like i was a naughty child or something
56,<|emo_sad|> im feeling depressed not because i have to get out of bed everyday but because i just get so little done
57,<|emo_sad|> i feel pretty unimportant in that world
58,"<|emo_sad|> Sorry, if you're wondering, it's still currently being worked on. Stay tuned!"

73,<|emo_sad|> i just can t help but feel hopeless
74,<|emo_sad|> i feel like i do when im feeling alone
75,<|emo_sad|> i was feeling rather useless
76,"<|emo_sad|> Sorry, did not know I was going to call bullshit on this one"
77,<|emo_sad|> And they'd probably need to get bailed out somehow.
78,<|emo_sad|> i feel ungrateful not having a home that i feel content when i have one
79,"<|emo_sad|> That's the sad part, he's had a lot of injuries, but they're not life-threatening. He'll be okay."
80,"<|emo_sad|> Sorry to hear that, bad day for the week. "
81,<|emo_sad|> i feel dumb for leaving the post if i don t have any action yet

83,<|emo_sad|> I miss [NAME] and [NAME] but am satisfied with this team.
84,<|emo_sad|> i am now feeling really lonely

88,<|emo_sad|> im feeling heartbroken and confused for these reasons alone

91,<|emo_sad|> I have been abused enough by this administration...
92,"<|emo_sad|> This is an old one, the same one I had it in my hand from when I first joined. Big hugs to reddit for letting me know"
93,<|emo_sad|> Sad thing is it's easier said than done unfortunately
94,<|emo_sad|> i feel like a lot of people dont really understand this

102,<|emo_sad|> i feel so dumb and so guilty
103,<|emo_sad|> i really feel bad
104,<|emo_sad|> I'm actually sad I had to come this far down to find this.
105,<|emo_sad|> i wish i did this but i do not believe that feeling regretful is enough to change a person s attitude and thus change their behavior
106,"<|emo_sad|> She's been through hell and back, ya'll. /s"
107,<|emo_sad|> i feel guilty because it feels a little vain
108,<|emo_sad|> i feel sorry for you that you are the target of some hateful eyes
109,<|emo_sad|> i feel like there some horrible dark secret that i need to learn
110,<|emo_sad|> ive always been a really reluctant romantic because of the feeling that if i did not make him feel that im in serious and serious love
111,<|emo_sad|> i also feel kind of bad for him
112,<|emo_sad|> i feel more isolated and less sociable
113,<|emo_sad|> I’m so sorry to hear that. Stay strong
114,<|emo_sad|> i was thinking to myself that i could maybe get out of this feeling but im not sure if anything could budge

116,<|emo_sad|> i feel a little bit disheartened
117,<|emo_sad|> im trying to get away when i feel hopeless
118,<|emo_sad|> i feel like im the annoying one again
119,<|emo_sad|> i feel quite unwelcome
120,<|emo_sad|> i can see the suffering behind it all and it still hurts me to learn that i can teach others to be happy in the same way you are and now that i see myself going that way i feel helpless for you
121,<|emo_sad|> i feel aching for him and i miss him and i know he has no idea why
122,<|emo_sad|> i started feeling lame and had my period which has now started
123,<|emo_sad|> My condolences.
124,"<|emo_sad|> That's pretty lewd. I'll say it again, though. Please [NAME] help her out. "
125,"<|emo_sad|> Oh [NAME], stop with the apologies and condolences. Please know that these events don't make you angry, they make you afraid. "
126,<|emo_sad|> i feel so guilty for crying on my bed as a baby i have to stay away from him because he takes me back
127,<|emo_sad|> i feel like most days i can t think of how id done without it

136,<|emo_sad|> i was feeling lonely and lonely was lonely and lonely
137,<|emo_sad|> i feel pathetic when i write songs or videos about my feelings of shame i think well
138,<|emo_sad|> i don t feel guilty for this
139,<|emo_sad|> i feel very disheartened today
140,<|emo_sad|> i feel really stupid
141,<|emo_sad|> i feel like i have no excuse for being this disheartened and isolated these past months i ve been really close to a lot of people and ive been in a bit of a place of introspection
142,<|emo_sad|> im feeling pretty needy right now
143,<|emo_sad|> I'm really sorry. We'll keep you posted.
144,<|emo_sad|> I am sorry. Stay strong :(

156,<|emo_sad|> This is really sad. She's one of the nicest people that i know. You deserve so much better.
157,"<|emo_sad|> Yeah, I think everyone saw it as an apology. "
158,<|emo_sad|> I miss having my legs straight and my butt Horace.
159,<|emo_sad|> im feeling very discouraged now
160,"<|emo_sad|> Just a scammer and he's looking for attention. Don't buy his story though, he's a scammer looking for attention."
161,<|emo_sad|> i feel really bad for their daughter
162,<|emo_sad|> i feel more pathetic
163,<|emo_sad|> [NAME] that would hurt more if I say it personally
164,<|emo_sad|> That hurt too much to watch twice.

172,<|emo_sad|> i didnt feel awful all day
173,<|emo_sad|> i feel pathetic for feeling such a pathetic thing
174,"<|emo_sad|> It could be that he feels he has failed you, because the next time he met you - he would know what to do."
175,<|emo_sad|> That girl is inebriated if she's had a drink the past two hours.
176,<|emo_sad|> i never thought that i could have loved a person very much that much though i thought it was possible to give it a try
177,<|emo_sad|> i feel like i m the one who is being really fucked up by this
178,"<|emo_sad|> Oh for sure. Please do not let that stop you. It’s not worth it. I actually really miss [NAME], though. :( Her character was a great disappointment though."
179,<|emo_sad|> A sad and very dancing video.
180,<|emo_sad|> What a sad story. RIP
181,<|emo_sad|> i feel hopeless often just as i feel hopeless
182,<|emo_sad|> i always feel so pathetic in front of my loved ones and myself
183,<|emo_sad|> i feel a lot of missed opportunities and frustrating disappointments
184,<|emo_sad|> i feel so ungrateful and ashamed
185,<|emo_sad|> i feel kinda dumb because ive wanted to for some time now
186,<|emo_sad|> i feel so lame with just one pic and its about time for me to update my website and Facebook page

188,<|emo_sad|> i began to feel ugly
189,<|emo_sad|> i am left feeling empty
190,<|emo_sad|> i feel like im not really a good mommy but instead i try to keep trying to do exactly what my mom did
191,<|emo_sad|> i woke up feeling a little too groggy with some wine
192,<|emo_sad|> i feel kind of dumb for wondering about it and probably have been for a long time
193,<|emo_sad|> i started to feel lame
194,<|emo_sad|> i feel pretty shitty about myself lately
195,<|emo_sad|> I've spent a lot of time wondering what happened to wake From slept and woke I thought it might be a dream
196,<|emo_sad|> i feel dumb for being so sad
198,<|emo_sad|> i could have a long walk down that lonely road with the sounds of war drones and nightmarish creatures far in the distance and nothing to make me feel gloomy or gloomy enough to pass out
199,<|emo_sad|> So sad. An innocent man's life is ruined because of a false accusation.
200,<|emo_sad|> Sorry you are lonely
201,<|emo_sad|> i feel so hopeless in my life
202,<|emo_sad|> Oh I'm sorry.
203,<|emo_sad|> That's some poor excuse for a username.
204,<|emo_sad|> There’s a lot of us [NAME]. [NAME] in particular has been a real pain.
205,<|emo_sad|> i feel helpless no one or nothing
206,"<|emo_sad|> Sorry, but it does... "
207,<|emo_sad|> i am feeling pathetic
208,<|emo_sad|> i feel so boring that i am surprised that i am not at work right now
209,<|emo_sad|> i feel helpless and out of control
210,<|emo_sad|> i feel that things were pretty bad for the kids but the biggest issue im all depressed about right now is the lack of any sort of response from me
211,<|emo_sad|> i feel pretty rotten about it
213,<|emo_sad|> Ahhhh. I thought you said your name was [NAME]. Sorry about being off my friend!
214,<|emo_sad|> i can tell him and i ll tell him and feel really lame
215,<|emo_sad|> i also know im often guilty of feeling guilty not knowing the extent of the damage done
216,<|emo_sad|> My fault is mine alone
217,<|emo_sad|> i hate it feeling so guilty about all the emotional stuff in the world
218,"<|emo_sad|> I really am sorry for your loss. The internet always makes my day. She's a big kid, 11, she didn't deserve that."
219,<|emo_sad|> i feel really dumb for saying that but it s true
220,<|emo_sad|> i was feeling a little lonely tonight
221,"<|emo_sad|> She had one eye open so I didn't know what she looked like, just a dull pain "
222,<|emo_sad|> i feel i should have the same understanding of things that i feel you have and let myself be thankful to be with you
223,<|emo_sad|> [NAME] i feel you.
224,<|emo_sad|> im not sure i feel unimportant when i am here to provide you with good news for the faithful
225,<|emo_sad|> Sadly that's probably the worst situation my parents found themselves in.
226,<|emo_sad|> i feel it was unfortunate that this happened and i feel ungrateful for how lucky i have met these people
227,<|emo_sad|> Yeah this makes me feel even worse about humanity.... I hope you and all the kids continue on your righteous path of goodness.
228,<|emo_sad|> i feel like im in a terrible mood because im not sure where to start
229,<|emo_sad|> i feel sorry for the people who watched it
230,<|emo_sad|> This would be my worst fear
231,<|emo_sad|> i feel alone i can have no one to talk to because my mind is blank as to what i am doing wrong and i just don t know and i feel so damn empty
232,<|emo_sad|> i will be feeling really lonely at work because im a little bit older than my employees and everyone will be looking their noses at me
233,<|emo_sad|> i feel totally unimportant at work and am miserable in my own home
234,"<|emo_sad|> She did it because she had nothing better to do, nothing more worthwhile to complain about"
235,<|emo_sad|> i have been feeling pretty homesick and i feel as if i could go anywhere.
236,<|emo_sad|> im a bit of a romantic and i feel a bit melancholy and lost on a number of things
237,<|emo_sad|> i feel so guilty for being so selfish as well
238,<|emo_sad|> i went to get a toothache but ended up toothless just because i had no tooth all week
239,<|emo_sad|> I hate Twitter
240,<|emo_sad|> i will never feel heartless about the ones who have lost or are near to losing a parent
241,"<|emo_sad|> I feel so bad for that little girl. She likely just wanted to be with someone, if that."
242,<|emo_sad|> i could feel the pressure building up as each time i tried to make a mistake or make a mistake that would have caused me to lose my standing with them
243,<|emo_sad|> i feel kind of pathetic
244,<|emo_sad|> i suppose i feel a bit too numb at the moment
245,<|emo_sad|> i feel sorry for that he doesn t want you to come because he thinks youve got no worth
246,"<|emo_sad|> Sadly the same way I let my anxiety get the best of me, I let my depression get the worse."
247,<|emo_sad|> im feeling somewhat depressed
248,<|emo_sad|> i never thought i ll feel so disheartened but i did
250,<|emo_sad|> i feel alone and ashamed
251,<|emo_sad|> That's even scarier.
252,<|emo_sad|> i can remember that i could feel the cold wind and no rain but i could feel my body temperature rise quickly
253,<|emo_sad|> i hate feeling that empty feeling
254,<|emo_sad|> i would be feeling very stupid not taking these shots and even worse not talking to him that he is really sick
255,<|emo_sad|> im feeling quite discontent at the moment
256,<|emo_sad|> i have been feeling a little isolated in my life for a while now
257,<|emo_sad|> i think its because i feel burdened by some issues
258,"<|emo_sad|> I feel sorry for the people that have been affected by that, it's unfortunate and humbling at the same time. "
259,<|emo_sad|> It's sad that [NAME] makes himself the center of attention whenever he speaks. His comments should be more focused.
260,"<|emo_sad|> How sad. I really really hope this is an isolated isolated incident, but it seems like it is."
261,<|emo_sad|> i feel so defeated again and i say yes to a million little things
262,<|emo_sad|> i feel that im sorry a lot
263,"<|emo_sad|> Sadly, there are no other countries in the world that can match us in defense either."
264,<|emo_sad|> i didn t make him to feel guilty but i did make him aware he is going off his medications for a very long day and no matter how well you feel i don t get any votes
265,<|emo_sad|> i always feel devastated before my eyes are opened
266,<|emo_sad|> i have no idea what i feel the universe is telling me that its something to do with me being the most selfish and selfish of people
267,<|emo_sad|> i can feel its suffering but i won t let it die
268,<|emo_sad|> i feel really heartbroken because i have been getting a lot of people to get in touch with me for about a year now
269,<|emo_sad|> I miss them...
270,<|emo_sad|> i feel like i missed out on the most underrated movie of all time the good old gedir gro Harlem the young suzanne raul
271,<|emo_sad|> Oh [NAME] those poor poor poorugs
272,<|emo_sad|> i can feel myself losing focus on my writing and trying to keep it together while i write
273,"<|emo_sad|> Yes, the lack of options is the main thing!"
274,<|emo_sad|> i feel like a lousy parent
275,<|emo_sad|> im feeling awful and so is everyone else
276,<|emo_sad|> i feel hopeless at times and ashamed at times
277,<|emo_sad|> i am feeling pretty homesick in north america at the moment
278,<|emo_sad|> I'm a mommy in recovery and I'm crying because this is the one post about it that has made me actually stop crying.

287,<|emo_sad|> Not the right sub unfortunately.
288,<|emo_sad|> i feel a bit dirty in it
289,<|emo_sad|> i can only hope that you can look at this and feel what i feel for i know that you are doing a amazing job
290,"<|emo_sad|> I'm in the same boat. I'm sad for you, but [NAME] is much higher up."
291,<|emo_sad|> i feel quite miserable a href http mssuicide
292,<|emo_sad|> Sorry didn’t realize i’m on my third play through this game. Good job.
293,<|emo_sad|> i feel the lack of confidence in my sense of self and the lack of trust in my partner
294,<|emo_sad|> She would need to run away and hide to avoid being punished
295,<|emo_sad|> i feel ashamed to have been brought up in a home where that didnt happen
296,<|emo_sad|> Happy birthday!
297,<|emo_sad|> Yeah I can't see myself taking a job in a bank if my boss told me I have to take up 100 hours of volunteer work a week just to make his day
298,<|emo_sad|> I'm sorry you had that experience. May you find peace in the following days.

312,<|emo_sad|> im sorry not sorry
313,<|emo_sad|> i feel a little sad that i missed the chance to see him
314,"<|emo_sad|> You miss the beauty of nature. All those big trees, amazing views, a cool campsite and lots of streams."
315,<|emo_sad|> i do feel doomed my whole life to nothing more than an old mattress
317,"<|emo_sad|> That would leave 31 teams, so I imagine you're just wrong."
318,<|emo_sad|> I think the one with the weird face got the Best of them 😢
319,"<|emo_sad|> So sorry, for your loss. Our thoughts and condolences."

432,"<|emo_sad|> My parents died inside the church I was raised in, it was a really hard time for me and I think the weight my parents' deaths laid on me was the biggest sacrifice I ever made for a god"
433,"<|emo_sad|> Lol that was an offhand comment on a thread about whether the Saints should re-sign him, I wish I could be one of them. Well at least you'll miss him on the open market"

463,<|emo_sad|> I'm crying.
464,<|emo_sad|> i get a feeling the other guy is just a bit too smug and self centered to be much of a person for any serious woman to genuinely desire with any serious man
465,<|emo_sad|> Not that there's any basis for the claim. A lot of people in this thread are horrible and are probably trolling.
466,<|emo_sad|> i can feel more emotional now

481,<|emo_sad|> i feel so lame these days i m afraid
482,<|emo_sad|> This isn't a sad thread. This was a post about a sad game that's been a thing for a century now. Get over it.
483,<|emo_sad|> i am also feeling discouraged
484,<|emo_sad|> I'm just so sad I'm going to have to go pick up a bb. And my cravings are just starting to creep up....

524,<|emo_sad|> i feel like i should have come in at the very end this time around after all i m only broke because i didnt come in
525,<|emo_sad|> This is just sad and depressing. May you all find comfort in someone you can truly rely on.
526,<|emo_sad|> i get to make another video about those things and it just feels so crap so wrong so good
527,<|emo_sad|> im feeling rather sad because i cant be alone with this

564,<|emo_sad|> i have decided the rest of the year is going to be a pretty pathetic year which is why i thought it was best for me to end my year here before i do so
