0,<|emo_disgust|> Damn you're on fire!
1,<|emo_disgust|> The media ruined any chance that [NAME] would ever run for public office. Don’t forget about [NAME] and [NAME]
2,<|emo_disgust|> I'm literally shaking right now😫
3,<|emo_disgust|> What a horrible list
4,"<|emo_disgust|> It's so infuriating how similar the ""identity politics"" of the left to our own are."
5,<|emo_disgust|> Holy hellin heck
6,<|emo_disgust|> This is creepy.
7,<|emo_disgust|> I'd throw him out...
8,"<|emo_disgust|> No, he did NOT. I swear he didn't."
9,<|emo_disgust|> Well this is frustrating.
10,<|emo_disgust|> i want to see the blood and guts but the more i think about it the more it makes me feel dissatisfied for a lack of a better meat
11,<|emo_disgust|> When you're the one who's going for it? And even worse if you don't get it...
12,<|emo_disgust|> That was so disgusting. VWP
13,<|emo_disgust|> This is a terrible advice
14,<|emo_disgust|> You're creepy
15,<|emo_disgust|> i feel incredibly impatient to be done with this school if he can be seen doing anything but playing outside i wouldn t really feel ok with this anymore
16,"<|emo_disgust|> That’s just...sorry. I really wish I could say that, but I really can’t. Just really bad advice."
17,<|emo_disgust|> So. Damn. Greasy.
18,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck I love you prag
19,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking idiot lol
20,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is on fire!!!!!
21,"<|emo_disgust|> Holy crap, this is bad"
22,<|emo_disgust|> I hate this.
23,<|emo_disgust|> You are so ugly even tears wont show up near you
24,<|emo_disgust|> i feel dissatisfied with
25,<|emo_disgust|> Because people have no shame.
26,"<|emo_disgust|> I hate saying this, but I love video games enough to watch this multiple times"
27,<|emo_disgust|> Well you do need help then...
28,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, I wasn’t paying that much attention before I realized this, sorry if I was bashing you "
29,"<|emo_disgust|> Just to add insult to injury, she's also running mate because she can't run [NAME]."
30,<|emo_disgust|> Weird that your girlfriend has a body like mine with all of the blemishes....
31,"<|emo_disgust|> But if it’s fake, how come they still run testicles into our assesholes?"
32,"<|emo_disgust|> When [NAME] goes on an apparent mission and is constantly making excuses for his lousy play and attitude, well, [NAME] is taking quite some heat."
33,<|emo_disgust|> What's the link to the other thread?
34,<|emo_disgust|> The amount of hate they get in this thread is insane.
35,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm just here for the ""Kerry won the popular vote"" meme."
36,<|emo_disgust|> It’s kinda weird that everyone is saying this while also saying [NAME] is terrible.
37,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that you think that is a worse thing to do is absolutely astounding.
38,<|emo_disgust|> It’s weird to think that there are still [NAME] fans out there though.
39,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn, she sounds awful."
40,<|emo_disgust|> You're a mean person.
41,"<|emo_disgust|> This is like a scene from Get Out. You can tell the writer was a little insecure before getting this stage, but he seems damn good now."
42,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst I've seen.
43,<|emo_disgust|> She’s so scared 😭
44,"<|emo_disgust|> If you can give away your credit card info yet still want to buy it, youll go a long way."
45,"<|emo_disgust|> This is so horrifying. Even if you're an animal rights supporter and haven't read much about her, this is worse. "
46,<|emo_disgust|> i know that i am going to make people feel extremely dissatisfied with me
47,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] fucking stop
48,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] fucked up.
49,<|emo_disgust|> Youre a horrible person.
50,<|emo_disgust|> You're disgusting
51,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, that's stupid."
52,<|emo_disgust|> You have to be an idiot or a monster to use your parents as an excuse to be an asshole.
53,<|emo_disgust|> A fuckin men
54,<|emo_disgust|> They don't really have much of a presence outside of those 2 states. Most of their focus really seems to be to hype groups to get their message out.
55,<|emo_disgust|> That video is honestly the worst thing I've seen on this subreddit lately
56,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is just having the wrong kind of friends.
57,<|emo_disgust|> They are so ugly. Let's make them even uglier!
58,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm not sure that's a fair charge because you're not actually saying ""charged for sharing memes"""
59,"<|emo_disgust|> You are a horrible human being, and you deserve all the horrible things humanity can throw at you."
60,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that that's the only available save is absolutely infuriating. There's no other way to get this chest on the list so it's probably the worst way to get it now.
61,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking n
62,"<|emo_disgust|> Fuck I’ve never seen this before, terrible."
63,<|emo_disgust|> How DARE you!
64,<|emo_disgust|> I really hate this.
65,<|emo_disgust|> Your worst fear is actually becoming a worse version of yourself...
66,<|emo_disgust|> Why is she f*cking ruining [NAME] culture
67,"<|emo_disgust|> This is one of those ""should have known better"" situations where I agree with the offended party but not the offended person."
68,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn it
69,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh look, [NAME] isn’t even on the roster. What an idiot some fans have become. LOL"
70,<|emo_disgust|> Oh I wish I could remember that one. :(
71,<|emo_disgust|> Just awful.
72,<|emo_disgust|> That’s sick! Good idea to talk to a therapist and get help.
73,<|emo_disgust|> Sooooo much finger food. 🤣
74,<|emo_disgust|> Your video is trash. Disgusting.
75,<|emo_disgust|> Just piss off
76,<|emo_disgust|> This story made my day
77,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a moron
78,<|emo_disgust|> Ohh that?! I didn't know you could get away with that. I'd be shocked if she's guilty though
79,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn it.
80,<|emo_disgust|> Thats pretty lewd.
81,<|emo_disgust|> Who are the awful people that call themselves liberals when in reality all they care about is abortion?
82,<|emo_disgust|> Don't you forget it!
83,<|emo_disgust|> This is the saddest thing I've seen today.
84,"<|emo_disgust|> Holy crap, that scene is just awesome. The way he's covered in grime and shit just makes it all the more disturbing."
85,<|emo_disgust|> I think there's a real chance he's Asperger's.
86,<|emo_disgust|> Holy crap that was fucking bad...
87,<|emo_disgust|> Those women are the worst.
88,<|emo_disgust|> I don't think we're doing a good job educating people about our progress.
89,"<|emo_disgust|> I will never, ever ever own a gun."
90,<|emo_disgust|> Your husband is disgusting.
91,<|emo_disgust|> It’s creepy actually
92,<|emo_disgust|> That feels terrible. I hope you are doing better. I'm so sorry.
93,<|emo_disgust|> This thread is getting extremely energetic. In a good way.
94,<|emo_disgust|> He's weirdly attractive
95,<|emo_disgust|> The best part of [NAME] stories is how they constantly change their minds.
96,<|emo_disgust|> Aaaand now your angry because a-holes won't let you have sex with anyone.
97,<|emo_disgust|> Holy heckin heck! I was walking home from work one day and stopped and cheered for the purple dragon. Just being awesome right now.
98,<|emo_disgust|> He just wants people to stop believing [RELIGION] is the right religion and that all of society is somehow evil and that's just sad and insane.
99,<|emo_disgust|> Don't like your boyfriend? You just need to get a divorce.
100,<|emo_disgust|> This is just another way [NAME] has been supporting his business model by cheating. He should close up shop right now.
101,<|emo_disgust|> What a dumbass. Thanks for the correction.
102,"<|emo_disgust|> No one to blame here, bad luck would've been hard to avoid if he wasn't on this team."
103,<|emo_disgust|> What the hell
104,<|emo_disgust|> >This guy is a fucking paranoid schizophrenic I want to commit suicide
105,<|emo_disgust|> It’s so weird and disgusting how much I like this
106,<|emo_disgust|> It sounds spasticated and frustrating.
107,"<|emo_disgust|> Shut up y'all, [NAME]!"
108,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds awful.
109,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]? Just horrible.
110,<|emo_disgust|> I'm too ugly to have sex.
111,<|emo_disgust|> That’s my favorite wild memory
112,<|emo_disgust|> I was with my parents who were also [RELIGION] and it was disgusting to watch.
113,<|emo_disgust|> What a disgusting and dangerous set of instructions!
114,"<|emo_disgust|> If the claim is valid, it would not be surprising given his history. His history with child abuse is disturbing."
115,<|emo_disgust|> This is a perfect example of someone who has completely lost it and is trying to call anyone out on making fun of autism and other such issues. It’s so incredibly disgusting.
116,<|emo_disgust|> i just feel as though it all could be rushed
117,<|emo_disgust|> That’s not a fucking card?!
118,<|emo_disgust|> He is a moron.
119,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, my gosh! You’re cute!"
120,<|emo_disgust|> That was really brutal. Tagged him pretty bad on there.
121,<|emo_disgust|> That's some fucked up shit right there
122,<|emo_disgust|> You've been banned for posting this.ban.*
123,<|emo_disgust|> Those women are the scum of the earth.
124,<|emo_disgust|> That one missed layup by [NAME] is pretty telling
125,<|emo_disgust|> A fucking centaur
126,<|emo_disgust|> i would really prefer not to feel rushed or rushed into making music
127,"<|emo_disgust|> This makes me physically ill, imagine if a child did this..."
128,<|emo_disgust|> That was disgusting. Now there's even worse on the way.
129,<|emo_disgust|> This is awful.
130,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I quit blogging. /s
131,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn you are autistic
132,"<|emo_disgust|> That's awful, but I'm also very happy to learn, so it's okay. "
133,<|emo_disgust|> So what you are saying is that you are a racist is you just don’t know how to think for yourself
134,"<|emo_disgust|> I really hate doing that myself, because I have such bad control of my stomach and back muscles these days..."
135,<|emo_disgust|> Lol you're an awful person.
136,<|emo_disgust|> They're scared
137,<|emo_disgust|> I would say it is probably a bad thing to do in your situation but what I would say is that you should probably just make an effort to do something.
138,<|emo_disgust|> That’s a weird way of saying no self control
139,<|emo_disgust|> You've got to really look at what people are saying and then dealing with it
140,"<|emo_disgust|> No its disgusting, check out their videos. Its not a video game, it's a propaganda tool. "
141,<|emo_disgust|> Because people have the temerity to call 9-1-1 non-existent and then call an ambulance for someone who they think is a moron.
142,<|emo_disgust|> That’s disgusting.
143,<|emo_disgust|> That is quite disgusting actually.
144,"<|emo_disgust|> If you use a service that charges you for their speedy delivery, you're a scammer."
145,"<|emo_disgust|> If it's a horror, it's pretty bad. Just overall awful."
146,<|emo_disgust|> I want to say I'm not sorry for how I've reacted in the past. I've also said similar things before. Just gotta be extra careful now.
147,<|emo_disgust|> Worst case scenario is she’s a psychopathic sex crimes victim. Not all sex attacks are motivated by a desire to hurt or control.
148,<|emo_disgust|> My dad's a cop and has killed innocent young men by driving while drunk.
149,<|emo_disgust|> That scene traumatized me the first time I watched it
150,<|emo_disgust|> My boyfriend's mom told me the other day that my new bike is hers. I'm gonna need to say that to the store
151,<|emo_disgust|> A guy that size can kill entire families...
152,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you make an attempt to be kind to her!
153,<|emo_disgust|> Oh wow I didn't know he's that talented ahhhhhhhh
154,"<|emo_disgust|> And you're telling me that I'm a terrible, ignorant piece of shit? Well, y'all are pretty bad at what you do, aren't ya?"
155,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking cunt
156,<|emo_disgust|> Don't worry about it you're still getting your paychecks..
157,<|emo_disgust|> They’re scared
158,<|emo_disgust|> It’s not gonna help. Get better and stop posting. It’s not gonna stop any time soon.
159,<|emo_disgust|> That's pretty lewd. Not even a slightly above-average height.
160,"<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit, that was fast"
161,"<|emo_disgust|> He has a wife who is a porn addict, what does he do?"
162,<|emo_disgust|> She looks like [NAME]...
163,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch I just had one of those moments!
164,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck this gif
165,"<|emo_disgust|> I'll kill you if you do that again, Scoot!"
166,<|emo_disgust|> It was a horrible call. Everyone should boycott Netflix for these kinds of mistakes.
167,<|emo_disgust|> i feel very jealous of my friends and the culture they live in
168,<|emo_disgust|> It's more that the false accusation makes my anxiety worse
169,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a horrible person and we all should hate her but ok she’s a horrible celebrity
170,<|emo_disgust|> i feel a little stressed out and irritated
171,<|emo_disgust|> Oh I hate [NAME] too
172,<|emo_disgust|> You took the wrong lane.rew
173,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, probably took quite some effort for that to actually be seen."
174,"<|emo_disgust|> It's a lie, and it's disgusting. "
175,<|emo_disgust|> What that pic really shows is you don't care about women's issues at all.
176,<|emo_disgust|> This is how you get killed by a drunk driver.
177,<|emo_disgust|> Because the whole point of being a vegan on a cruelty free basis is to support the animals it isn't cruel per se... it's a strategy to use your animal cruelty to further your own vegan agenda
178,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] I hate Twitter
179,<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting what you did. I’m with you. No one deserves to act like that to you.
180,<|emo_disgust|> The most romantic thing I've ever read on this sub
181,<|emo_disgust|> They're so ugly i hate them
182,<|emo_disgust|> >I have no idea how this is a hate sub Oh man
183,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck off.
184,<|emo_disgust|> And the worst is when it's something you alone contribute to.
185,<|emo_disgust|> This is so disgusting. Where are the adults? And the little abomination with the flamingo head still attached to the chicken is definitely the worst.
186,<|emo_disgust|> This post is bad because the only good phone is the Palm Pre 3 running webOS
187,"<|emo_disgust|> I honestly feel like a snob. I want cheap eats, I want comfort food, I dont care what kind of prep time or prep/cleanliness involved."
188,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that this is being brought up makes me wonder why [NAME] is unhireable...
189,<|emo_disgust|> Oh look a fat old man telling a story in front of a skinny little girl.
190,<|emo_disgust|> Your age difference is incredibly creepy.
191,<|emo_disgust|> She looks like [NAME]. Don't mess with [NAME].
192,<|emo_disgust|> He was born inCologne and lived there as an adult. He was a terrible human being in every way but he's still the only politician I've voted for.
193,<|emo_disgust|> i will still not listen to them as im feeling a bit insulted by it all
194,"<|emo_disgust|> They play loud music, dance around the beat, and yell at you. Get outta here"
195,<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting.
196,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] fuckin sucks.
197,<|emo_disgust|> I like it
200,<|emo_disgust|> I was a student body president and that was your biggest event?
202,<|emo_disgust|> The fuck you talking about mano apero
203,<|emo_disgust|> i feel angry that she didn t call me a sweet person and a wonderful person instead of someone who could be honest and truthful
204,<|emo_disgust|> He’s creepy
205,<|emo_disgust|> I hate when I have to scroll through an article to read the name of a top rated comment...
206,<|emo_disgust|> i feel a little bit like a naughty school child
207,"<|emo_disgust|> Not that it could possibly be because of a bad economy. I mean, you can't just get lazy after a short job."
208,<|emo_disgust|> Because their leaders lack critical thinking skills.
209,<|emo_disgust|> I'm literally dumbstruck.
210,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is scary...
211,"<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell thought he was dead, seriously."
212,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, are you saying she should not be president because you personally knew her? "
213,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, then you can tell them about it. There is no ""it sucks"" exception for religion."
214,<|emo_disgust|> That's just so disgusting.
215,<|emo_disgust|> Thats just sick! I just can’t look at it. I hate the way it looks.
216,<|emo_disgust|> That’s horrible. I’m like 'ooof' all the time.
218,<|emo_disgust|> Don't you fucken do it
219,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]. They hate him.
220,"<|emo_disgust|> We are all [NAME], there's nothing wrong in saying [NAME] is a fascist. Just think of the horror of concentration camps."
221,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, I think I see cheekbones...*eyeroll*"
222,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful.
223,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, it wouldn't take much to cause her death by accident."
224,<|emo_disgust|> He’s bad
227,<|emo_disgust|> You're a freak.
228,"<|emo_disgust|> No, I just don't see how."
230,"<|emo_disgust|> I was just gonna say that. He is not a bad choice, but he's not a great one either."
231,<|emo_disgust|> You must have no idea how many times I've told you I'd never do that. I still regret it.
232,<|emo_disgust|> I’m just gonna go ahead and call bullshit on most of the details of this story
233,<|emo_disgust|> What a terrible list
234,<|emo_disgust|> That shit definitely stank.
235,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating!
236,<|emo_disgust|> I have a nasty case of stage fright now because I thought I was going insane for a second.
237,<|emo_disgust|> It's absolutely disgusting
238,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating.
239,<|emo_disgust|> It is weird to be having sex without a condom sometimes.
240,<|emo_disgust|> That was such an ugly close.
241,<|emo_disgust|> Holy heckin heck
242,<|emo_disgust|> I feel like [NAME] and [NAME] would be super weird together.
243,<|emo_disgust|> Oh you mean the article? Because it seemed like it was getting a shit thread for being bad.
244,"<|emo_disgust|> A few days ago, her manager was flippant with a girl customer and said ""I can't be FIRED any more for dating"""
245,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is a website that says it isn’t true.
246,<|emo_disgust|> What a disgusting situation that was
247,"<|emo_disgust|> That's unfortunate news for you, I hope you have a long and interesting life ahead of you."
248,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah this makes me want to die
249,<|emo_disgust|> I know you know that this is true. That makes me feel even worse.
251,<|emo_disgust|> Because life is short and happiness is unattainable.
252,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing stopping this whole shit show is if [NAME] himself gets arrested.
253,"<|emo_disgust|> > Which is weird because ""progressive"" is usually a pejorative IRL."
254,"<|emo_disgust|> If you really think that one comment is inappropriate, you should watch her TED Talk (or the video)."
255,<|emo_disgust|> We’re not gonna win that game. Losing like that is a recipe for disaster.
256,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck
257,<|emo_disgust|> What a load of old shite.
259,<|emo_disgust|> You're going to hate it and want to try again in 6 months or so- take your best shot then don't be too long in your statement or anything!
260,<|emo_disgust|> But since when do you have to say that?
261,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is horrible... I hated watching him more than the [NAME] situation but he definitely isn't a worse option....
262,"<|emo_disgust|> The thing is, if you look at what they were, it was done way worse than a lot of stuff that [NAME] is talking about."
263,<|emo_disgust|> This is not a satire. This is an abuse of satire. Get your head out of your ass.
264,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like i m on the receiving end of a nasty surprise
265,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I'd feel worse if the cast were all insane conspiracy theorists.
266,<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck
267,<|emo_disgust|> They’re so damn clever.
268,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is scary
269,"<|emo_disgust|> My friends thought he was playing the game ""RS2: The Roadster""."
270,<|emo_disgust|> This comment is trash and I'm glad she died
271,<|emo_disgust|> What a bummer. This is our only loss this season.
272,<|emo_disgust|> He was so awkward in that video.
273,<|emo_disgust|> He might be crazy but at least he's not the only one... idk.
274,<|emo_disgust|> Weird but effective
275,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm honestly shocked I didn't catch this. The dude is a pro-Assad piece of shit, and he literally goes on and on about how horrible [NAME] is. "
276,"<|emo_disgust|> If the state does that - good for them, sucks for everyone else."
277,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst I've ever seen.
278,<|emo_disgust|> That's a real article? Isnt that what its about? How terrible.
279,<|emo_disgust|> What about “we’re mad at the world” then you’re cool
280,<|emo_disgust|> Damn this gives me anxiety
281,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting. It's like the third grade version of what the [NAME] did to our culture
282,<|emo_disgust|> i went to a christian meeting a few weeks ago and i feel quite offended and insulted because i am one
283,<|emo_disgust|> It's fucking disgusting.
284,<|emo_disgust|> He's creepy
285,<|emo_disgust|> When [NAME] is on a team like that I’m so happy
286,<|emo_disgust|> I actually kinda regret this post.
287,<|emo_disgust|> And that wig is awful
288,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting.
289,<|emo_disgust|> What a load of crap!!
290,"<|emo_disgust|> She’s still a virgin though, just not a virgin anymore."
292,<|emo_disgust|> This is the weirdest thing I've read today
293,<|emo_disgust|> I hated it but I had to watch it
294,<|emo_disgust|> When your 16 and a sex offender. Not a fucking hedgehog
295,<|emo_disgust|> Omg I hate it
296,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch! My heart!
297,"<|emo_disgust|> Lol! I'm sorry if I offended you, but can I have your business card number? "
298,<|emo_disgust|> Why yes that was a FUCKING BURN
299,<|emo_disgust|> He actually looks rather handsome in that dress
300,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I'm just glad that you're okay.
301,"<|emo_disgust|> I've seen this meme a million times. ""We're all GAWd on these kids"""
302,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn is that the grossest weve heard of [NAME]
303,<|emo_disgust|> Well fuck off.
304,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] [NAME] I hate Twitter
305,<|emo_disgust|> That's even worse honestly
306,<|emo_disgust|> i feel greedy
307,"<|emo_disgust|> The thing is not like it, he's a bit of a madman!"
308,<|emo_disgust|> Weird because all of them have been in the league for a bit?
309,<|emo_disgust|> This really hurts to watch
310,<|emo_disgust|> This looks kinda crappy
312,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, no wonder they call them ""the 4th Kind"""
313,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is working with dealerships
314,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like ive been incredibly distracted during this process
316,<|emo_disgust|> Lol kill me now
317,<|emo_disgust|> I do believe that the guy is a sex addict.
318,<|emo_disgust|> What a cruel world.
319,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I want to fuck this hot mom in the back seat"""
320,<|emo_disgust|> You're one disgusting human being.
321,<|emo_disgust|> No. They're creepy.
322,<|emo_disgust|> Your comment was removed for breaking rule 12. The rule is pretty simple: Don't provide irrelevant links or other types of tools for discussions. 
323,<|emo_disgust|> It sounds spasticated and ill-informed.
324,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not a [NAME] fan by any stretch but.... this... this makes me so sad... I just can't keep it together
325,"<|emo_disgust|> People are disgusting, insane animals."
326,<|emo_disgust|> How dare she! She's one of us! You'd think the rich had it rough...
327,<|emo_disgust|> I don't agree with [NAME] and I hate the way [NAME] is running his campaign.
328,<|emo_disgust|> She is literally a worse option than [NAME]
330,"<|emo_disgust|> Omg that's an awful opening. Also, the guy in the office with the airhorn is the same actor that played Oaken in Braid."
331,<|emo_disgust|> Why kill people with your thoughts? Isn't that the First and most basic law?
332,<|emo_disgust|> I'm so embarrassed! This is so awful... Im going to need therapy!
333,<|emo_disgust|> In the end I'll be just too busy pissing and screaming and making eye contact with the idiots to care.
334,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking loner I am
335,<|emo_disgust|> It’s the most infuriating thing I have to read on here.
336,"<|emo_disgust|> He wasn't wrong, and if he's got a different opinion than mine on an issue, he's not wrong. He just didn't give it a serious consideration."
337,<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting.
338,"<|emo_disgust|> I do agree to disagree. Yes, they are worse because we're not talking about actual people here."
339,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds terrible. Are you with park services? I think the roads are a bit better off without them.
341,"<|emo_disgust|> Not if you look at the calories. And while I don't want to goads anyone for being on a starvation diet, I still feel bad for those who follow [NAME]"
342,<|emo_disgust|> I don't like LES because they have the worst fan base and the worst owner.
343,"<|emo_disgust|> So weird and creepy, I had to share"
344,<|emo_disgust|> It's worse. They make it so ugly it looks like a painting.
345,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, I didn't know that! [NAME] here, I need to hear this before I go!"
347,"<|emo_disgust|> In your opinion, does the presence of a gun make it less dangerous?"
348,"<|emo_disgust|> Not all men harass women, but enough of them that it is worth mentioning."
349,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst I've ever seen. I can't imagine trying to eat anything that isn't made out of Polynesiaian mythology
350,"<|emo_disgust|> The lack of diversity makes it a bit awkward, as do the many attempts at assimilation and building bridges between races"
351,"<|emo_disgust|> Those are the only two [NAME] I've ever heard have awful pitchforks, but I'm still a little surprised they make it to Dodger games, despite being 6'11"" and 170 lb."
352,<|emo_disgust|> Your girlfriend sucks.
353,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh I get it now, you didn't really believe in [NAME] or something lol. "
354,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh my god, the lack of forward motion. It really hurts my brain."
355,<|emo_disgust|> Damn this is dope
356,<|emo_disgust|> Oh my [NAME] *blushes*
357,<|emo_disgust|> The guy in red is really nervous...
358,<|emo_disgust|> It was so fucking creepy
359,<|emo_disgust|> Well damn.
360,<|emo_disgust|> Oh look another shit call
361,<|emo_disgust|> i get really angry about everything
362,<|emo_disgust|> She's a weirdo.
363,<|emo_disgust|> It's a nasty-looking pizza
364,<|emo_disgust|> i am not feeling terribly spiteful
365,<|emo_disgust|> He's an angry elf
366,<|emo_disgust|> That's fucking creepy. What in the fuck?
368,<|emo_disgust|> Lol hate to say it but yes but he probably was not being truthful.
369,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah suck it, California"
370,<|emo_disgust|> Weird flex.
371,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is awful
372,<|emo_disgust|> It is honestly the weirdest thing he has said so far.
373,<|emo_disgust|> Wow I think the company name is [NAME].
374,"<|emo_disgust|> Not just you, but [NAME] made some very disgusting comments at the WCC."
375,<|emo_disgust|> Damn it!
376,<|emo_disgust|> Those are some weird eyes.
377,<|emo_disgust|> The biggest Nightmare
378,<|emo_disgust|> That game hurt.
379,<|emo_disgust|> That's a weird way to spell Disenchanted
381,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst we've gotten on our DFS teams in a while. It's almost likeaded by [NAME].
382,<|emo_disgust|> Well.... I guess the biggest loser is myself. But still....
383,<|emo_disgust|> Oh she dead
384,<|emo_disgust|> i got home feeling very agitated because i thought about all the things i could have done differently in my life
385,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah that is disgusting.
386,"<|emo_disgust|> He fucking loves to tell lies to people, isn’t he? Stop with the “lie” verbiage."
387,"<|emo_disgust|> It's weird, I feel like I see your sister or something at work every day."
389,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit that was fucking bad...
390,<|emo_disgust|> He's not an ugly cuckoo.
391,<|emo_disgust|> I’m a grown ass man. That cannot be allowed to stand. Its disgusting
392,<|emo_disgust|> Now I am sad
393,<|emo_disgust|> i could actually feel the cold now as the wind howling through the trees
394,<|emo_disgust|> I think that's racist
395,<|emo_disgust|> Because he's a moron and doesn't understand how taxes work...
396,<|emo_disgust|> He has a history of bizarre behavior that includes bizarre treatment of animals
397,<|emo_disgust|> That feels soooo good
398,<|emo_disgust|> She’s hideous
399,<|emo_disgust|> How incredibly dangerous
400,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is such a toxic asshole too
401,<|emo_disgust|> You don't need to post anything on this sub you stupid fuck
402,<|emo_disgust|> She looks weirdly older in these pics. 25.
403,<|emo_disgust|> It’s the best news I’ve heard all season. What a heartbreaking loss for the Eagles fan base.
404,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. He made a horrible play and should be punished. I'm sad for [NAME] too.
405,<|emo_disgust|> There are also racist morons everywhere.
406,<|emo_disgust|> What absolute garbage
407,<|emo_disgust|> It’s not hard to imagine. I have a feeling [NAME] is one of that breed
409,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, it's an online game too so..."
410,"<|emo_disgust|> This is weird to me, too. Are we from the same time period?"
411,<|emo_disgust|> Your comment was extremely rude and doxxing is about as illegal as it gets. FFS
412,<|emo_disgust|> This is so terrible. I'm so sorry.
413,"<|emo_disgust|> Who dares challenge him there, it's as simple as that. We all know [NAME] loves power plays and is intimidated by goalies. "
414,<|emo_disgust|> i remember feeling slightly offended by his question
415,<|emo_disgust|> So your parents are assholes too.
416,<|emo_disgust|> The internet hates girls.
417,<|emo_disgust|> My girlfriend's family is a bit of a odd couple actually. She also has a brother with autism.
419,"<|emo_disgust|> People who read this, it seems so crazy to me... :("
420,"<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating. I'm so tired of these ""we know [NAME] is going back to [NAME]"" threads, it's disgusting."
421,"<|emo_disgust|> Shut up, [NAME]!"
422,<|emo_disgust|> They've all fucked your mother. Just ask them. Just ask them.
423,<|emo_disgust|> This is horrible
424,<|emo_disgust|> I'll kill you.
425,<|emo_disgust|> Worst that could have happened
426,<|emo_disgust|> I hate Twitter...
427,"<|emo_disgust|> I think it is absolutely amazing how popular ""renaissance man"" is for this very reason."
428,<|emo_disgust|> This is some of the worst pass rush I've ever seen.
429,<|emo_disgust|> He was wrong. Just not terribly many people are like that.
430,"<|emo_disgust|> That guy from behind, where the hell is he?"
431,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I wanna find that couch there
432,"<|emo_disgust|> That's why you see these so-called ""centrist"" comments. They tend to be the most ignorant and hateful."
433,<|emo_disgust|> Because you're an asshole.
434,<|emo_disgust|> Damn. That’s a hot pic.
435,<|emo_disgust|> Now I'm wondering where everyone's been and what they're up to. I need more background on this.
436,<|emo_disgust|> He’s awful
437,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] why? He just doesnt look anything like [NAME].
438,<|emo_disgust|> What a shit twat
439,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so pissed off and angry
440,<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting. You should be ashamed for spreading such disgusting information.
441,<|emo_disgust|> That was brutal. Loved it.
442,<|emo_disgust|> I have a bad feeling about this...
443,<|emo_disgust|> I don't care how sick you are. Just throw up and stop trying to suck it back up.
444,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is having too much free time. Being given too much free time by your parents makes life sooooooooo hard for you.
445,<|emo_disgust|> And since when does the government tell you that a certain law is immoral? Take my money and run.
446,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] on the phone with [NAME] about the child. Sounds a little paranoid
447,"<|emo_disgust|> I see the ""right"" meme a lot but that meme also implies that he's a horrible person who should never even have been president."
448,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] really sucks
449,<|emo_disgust|> My mom would have laughed at this
450,<|emo_disgust|> They’re saying the same thing ‘but' they're being equally hateful to the [NAME] and [NAME] to the [NAME] and [NAME].
451,<|emo_disgust|> Wow. That’s really disturbing. Can you imagine? Imagine if these people were in your local shopping center
452,<|emo_disgust|> Well it just seems bad to have that many injuries on their team in one year.
453,<|emo_disgust|> No wonder crime is going up if these morons are in charge.
454,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is terrible, honestly. All the time and I love it."
456,"<|emo_disgust|> Lol, hate when people do that. You are one of us! ^v^"
457,"<|emo_disgust|> Who cares? My kid wouldn’t have a clue either. The point is that ‘the point’ is to tell us the truth. If he genuinely thought this was true, he’d be pissed."
458,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] sucks. Stay at home, get a job and never make any attempt to contact you again."
459,<|emo_disgust|> I agree. It’s extremely rude.
460,"<|emo_disgust|> Now that you mention it, I've seen some pretty bad ones..."
461,<|emo_disgust|> You are disgusting
462,"<|emo_disgust|> People are going to want to put their -isms on a poster that says ""I'm a [RELIGION]phobe"""
463,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has always been a troubled case
465,"<|emo_disgust|> I find the mouthy ""man up"" guys on dating sites creepily amusing."
466,"<|emo_disgust|> My parents always told me that. ""Do what you hate. When you hate it, change it."""
468,<|emo_disgust|> This is the type of post I make about an illness or injury that leaves you feeling helpless
469,<|emo_disgust|> I still call that bitch a friend.
471,<|emo_disgust|> No...how dare you make an attempt to be kind! /s
472,<|emo_disgust|> You cant pick and choose racism you dippy cunt
473,<|emo_disgust|> What a farce.
474,"<|emo_disgust|> He knows the difference between a bobbler and a hammer. The term literally means ""to smash or crush"". hammer is what she's doing."
475,<|emo_disgust|> He seems horrible
477,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, talk about being [NAME] [NAME]."
478,"<|emo_disgust|> The least disgusting option, it looks like you need to clean your butt."
479,"<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest thing about this, is how the top image is of [NAME]"
480,<|emo_disgust|> It's a pretty gross thing to do.
481,<|emo_disgust|> Your a monster!
482,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] i hate Twitter
483,"<|emo_disgust|> Not really cringe, just sad."
484,<|emo_disgust|> Your mom is horrible at math
485,<|emo_disgust|> I'm the most racist person on the internet. I hate you all.
486,<|emo_disgust|> This was a hate crime. Cut and dried.
487,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah it kind of sucks now.
488,<|emo_disgust|> The thing that kills me is that many of them actually believe their own hype.
489,<|emo_disgust|> This comment pisses me off.
490,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling quite greedy and selfish
491,<|emo_disgust|> It's almost like the movie business has become a more cynical version of media
492,<|emo_disgust|> No hate TGR I love playing him
493,"<|emo_disgust|> Holy fuck, the return of [NAME]??? Fuck off with your irrelevant bullshit. Go get your act together."
494,<|emo_disgust|> > but they love the taste of women. Gee that’s a new wrinkle on the old onion onion cake problem.
495,<|emo_disgust|> >[NAME] sounds like a guy on r/bengals rn. That is odd.
496,<|emo_disgust|> A lot of people's favourite video game is also their least favourite game. You can't pick and choose which franchises to hate though.
497,<|emo_disgust|> i feel it would be extremely rude to have posted the picture
498,<|emo_disgust|> They still can't refuse you. You are a danger to others.
499,<|emo_disgust|> That's why I've always been against using them in combination with abilities that cause knockback or other damage. We've made them such bad picks.
500,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst thing I've ever seen on Reddit.
501,<|emo_disgust|> The internet never disappoints.
502,<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest thing about this is how good his bottom lip looks in this pic.
503,<|emo_disgust|> That’s not a fucking football! That’s a fucking hunting rifle however!
505,<|emo_disgust|> The weird ones have double door in the back.
506,<|emo_disgust|> Because [NAME] is a horrible person and that's what makes him attractive?
507,<|emo_disgust|> It’s a matter of public record that he had a terrible relationship with his ex.... [NAME]
508,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn, she sounds exactly like my mom. I miss hard working moms."
509,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] doesn’t like to be taken advantage of. He gets so much angry and frustrated from all the people that would rip him off
510,<|emo_disgust|> It was probably done so that the studio could make demands on you
511,<|emo_disgust|> It’s an incredibly dangerous place to be a girl. Only YOU can save it from those who would seek to destroy it.
512,<|emo_disgust|> They were fucking appalled.
513,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird flex, but ok"
514,<|emo_disgust|> People are legitimately monsters.
515,<|emo_disgust|> We'll have another chance next week 😒
516,<|emo_disgust|> i feel that i am just not passionate about issues on the books yet
517,<|emo_disgust|> Lol there's a good chance I’d end up with a stoner friend
518,"<|emo_disgust|> i feel like this is one of these weird examples of a woman calling herself a ""masculinity"" and not having to actually say ""men don't have it better"""
519,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit that was fucking bad for a second
520,"<|emo_disgust|> It's weird to have feelings for [NAME], but not weird at all?"
521,<|emo_disgust|> >It looks like a weird joke You're right it's a weird one
522,<|emo_disgust|> People in this thread should either be excusing or ashamed for being so hateful
523,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, look another shit call"
524,"<|emo_disgust|> I was literally there for a second, the dude pushing a shopping cart was so fucking obnoxious "
525,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] this is horrible
526,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird how that works, though. Maybe use your fingers?"
527,<|emo_disgust|> What the FRICK
528,<|emo_disgust|> So you actually grew up in a barn?
529,<|emo_disgust|> People want safe places where they can be assaulted and report for harassment and assault. This is not one of them
530,<|emo_disgust|> That poor janitor.
531,<|emo_disgust|> That’s horrible
532,<|emo_disgust|> Oh no he didn't! Please elaborate on that story!
533,<|emo_disgust|> Weird flex but ok
534,"<|emo_disgust|> But no, that is just a person who is looking back, not looking back. What a horrible person she's become. "
535,<|emo_disgust|> If you find one that’s rotten just throw it away.
536,<|emo_disgust|> Lol I hate when I get these thoughts because it’s usually within a few hours.
537,<|emo_disgust|> Lol kill me now.
538,<|emo_disgust|> I really like your comment though. Please keep it civil okay?
539,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] it's called fascism
540,<|emo_disgust|> i just don t like being made to feel unimportant
541,<|emo_disgust|> That's the worst possible outcome
542,<|emo_disgust|> But I like him!
543,<|emo_disgust|> My point is that it’s disgusting what your doing to their planet.
544,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I've decided to move to the UK.
546,<|emo_disgust|> i feel completely dissatisfied with everything and everyone around me
547,"<|emo_disgust|> Well I can see how that could happen, so I will be punished for making fun of this tragedy, no?"
549,<|emo_disgust|> That [NAME] part killed me!
550,<|emo_disgust|> This is some of the weirdest shit I've ever seen.
551,<|emo_disgust|> But because he's a democrat and a racist. It's just stupid.
554,"<|emo_disgust|> It's not so much the content that's creepy, it's the way they worded their responses."
555,<|emo_disgust|> They would not admit that. It just shows how ignorant they are. No wonder we have 2.5.
556,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, it's the same bullshitpost I warned you about just hours ago, now with even worse graphics..."
557,<|emo_disgust|> No not funny just sad
558,<|emo_disgust|> That shit got us off our ass for like a week.
559,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] and [NAME] are fucking disgusting.
561,<|emo_disgust|> Lol you're disgusting
562,"<|emo_disgust|> And yet, you always want to go back. I’d be so damn pissed if I were this obsessed."
563,<|emo_disgust|> They said [NAME] never cared about the faithful faithful. Now their holy books are the worst.
564,<|emo_disgust|> There is another problem he's complaining about. His video has audio issues.
565,"<|emo_disgust|> That’s a shame because I feel so fond of those guys. But seriously, who are they?"
566,<|emo_disgust|> You beat me to this joke.
567,<|emo_disgust|> She's creepy
568,<|emo_disgust|> And the weird thing is they never even accuse the cops of anything but have a hard time focusing on this.
569,<|emo_disgust|> I would never tell my girlfriend not to drink anything. She should stay in her room!
570,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a disgusting�NAME. One of the worst in the nfl. Best All Star ever, benched him after one game "
571,<|emo_disgust|> I've been eating sushi for breakfast for 10 years now and it's by far the worst. Sashimi is even worse.
572,"<|emo_disgust|> That was worse than a movie jump scare, I can't imagine."
573,<|emo_disgust|> Holy crap I think I see cheekbones.
574,<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting. Even more disgusting is telling you tell us to go back and forth inanely.
575,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I thought we were just friends
576,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking bollocks
578,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that’s one tough ass kimono
579,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is making 15 goddamn bunnies
580,<|emo_disgust|> Oof that’s cringe
581,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, they probably are, so to speak. The issue is their lack of concern for the environment. "
582,<|emo_disgust|> She hated offing other girls on the bus. She knew what you meant 'em..
585,<|emo_disgust|> This is horrible. What a waste of plastic.
586,<|emo_disgust|> He is not an actual vegan but i'd fucking love him to get behind a plant based meal otherwise he'll just eat shit all the time
587,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird for [NAME] to state he wants to ""fix"" a hockey team but he also likes to point out how he wants to fixate on players at the expense of others"
589,<|emo_disgust|> We've also had it where the defense only responds to the offense by getting absolutely slaughtered by the offense - the defense does this from time to time too. 
590,"<|emo_disgust|> What a disgusting, legalized, government-run, puppy mill."
591,<|emo_disgust|> But then it was also a terrible cover for how the government is running its affairs in the wake of the financial crisis.
592,<|emo_disgust|> It really sucks that they're allowed to drink and drive but not teachers?
593,<|emo_disgust|> It's a fucking chicken fucken logo
594,<|emo_disgust|> This sucks. What a waste of plastic.
595,<|emo_disgust|> People need to stop being so politically correct and realizing that our political system is based around the idea that there are a set of laws and a set of standards that each person has to meet.
596,<|emo_disgust|> I feel really bad for the people who contracted measles because they worked in measles protection camps.
597,"<|emo_disgust|> I mean, if it's that serious a thing to consider, fine. But that's probably not a deal breaker in and of itself? "
598,<|emo_disgust|> The most recent issue has the exact same problems. It's getting even worse since they updated it a while ago.
599,"<|emo_disgust|> Your parents made horrible, abusive, verbally abusive, physically and verbally abusive choices. You're not going to change their mind."
600,<|emo_disgust|> Sooooooo okay.
601,<|emo_disgust|> That’s not very clean.
602,<|emo_disgust|> He is so incredibly rich...
603,<|emo_disgust|> i feel insulted in this way
604,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so hated that i feel like i am the only one hated on
605,<|emo_disgust|> This is weird and creepy
606,<|emo_disgust|> I don't mind. What's wrong with finding the right balance?
607,"<|emo_disgust|> There are so many good reasons to go vegan, why you're confused?"
608,<|emo_disgust|> It would make me disgusting. A figure.
609,<|emo_disgust|> The worst happens when the person you love gets caught with a lot of drugs/ They might die
610,"<|emo_disgust|> No, he is. It's weird that such amazing smarts and compassion aren't being expressed by these morons."
611,<|emo_disgust|> I think it's weird to try to understand people through their words because that’s the most common way you get fucked up.
614,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], that fucking sucks. Well played. Thanks for the update, buddy! "
615,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so angry
617,<|emo_disgust|> Not at all I hope
618,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] looks so miserable lately
619,<|emo_disgust|> Why are you so angry?
620,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, it's weird that's not the case. It was also 2017 and people didn't call it creepypasta."
622,<|emo_disgust|> This is a terrible idea
623,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a terrible writer.
624,<|emo_disgust|> I just hate seeing [NAME] used as an example here.
625,<|emo_disgust|> Well said
626,<|emo_disgust|> That’s not how we do it! We have a ton of fans that want to do it! The real funny part is you won’t hear it described in this subreddit!
627,"<|emo_disgust|> What is scary? Those memes have absolutely nothing to do with [NAME] and I’m glad you’re a kid who’s afraid to look up his name, [NAME]. "
628,<|emo_disgust|> What a fuckin n
629,<|emo_disgust|> He is an awful enough and somewhat notorious public speaker that many of his supporters are quite vocal about their ignorance rather than some kind of edgy conspiracy nonsense.
630,"<|emo_disgust|> He is just a man, and I think we all agree he has some weird mental health issues."
631,<|emo_disgust|> I hate being that girl. 
632,"<|emo_disgust|> Lol, gotta change all of my social media pages to the blocked ones now that they've all been taken up by the shithest of the internet, it's getting extremely crowded there already"
635,<|emo_disgust|> What a piece of shit.
636,<|emo_disgust|> Weird how it works if you're ugly.
637,<|emo_disgust|> Who is [NAME]
638,"<|emo_disgust|> Lol, if it's like a drawing, it's so shitty. "
639,<|emo_disgust|> That’s a disgusting amount of Sesame oil.
640,"<|emo_disgust|> That's just weird, you should not put your phone between your ears if you do that."
643,<|emo_disgust|> This is just the type of crap I've heard about. An absolute embarrassment to the city.
644,<|emo_disgust|> Wow this story was absolutely beautiful. So infuriating that people can be so hateful and hateful people can change your opinion of them instantly.
645,<|emo_disgust|> And I swear Denver has worse sports media personalities
646,"<|emo_disgust|> He also has a weird way of speaking, sounds like it could be From an alien tongue..."
647,<|emo_disgust|> Damn your dad is dumb
649,<|emo_disgust|> Damn these refs actually fucking hate us.
650,<|emo_disgust|> This is me all the time
651,<|emo_disgust|> I have a terrible feeling she’s going to kill us all.
652,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating that the players can't see the sarcasm but still want to damage [NAME]😂
653,<|emo_disgust|> Your comment was rude and in bad faith.
654,<|emo_disgust|> Because its creepy
655,<|emo_disgust|> That's just a fucking lie. The bottom line is he got banned for unspecified chat and behaviour.
656,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, that's dark"
657,<|emo_disgust|> I just saw this on Brows Held High and I thought it was amazing. I really hope she doesn't become president.
658,<|emo_disgust|> I hate that I like them
659,"<|emo_disgust|> No apologies needed. Love their work, great job!"
660,<|emo_disgust|> This is a horrible list
661,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit that sucks. How many of those were players? I mean no account is worse than a bot.
662,"<|emo_disgust|> >""You know...the third option is not getting married"". Stupid."
663,<|emo_disgust|> What. The. Fuck.
664,<|emo_disgust|> I fucking hate [NAME] and I just don’t like the ownership situation (at least for now) at the Senators.
665,"<|emo_disgust|> But the real problem is the ""free college"" part"
666,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, they should just leave him alone. He's bad at contact."
667,<|emo_disgust|> People in this thread are disgusting.
669,<|emo_disgust|> This is horrible. Take my upvote
670,<|emo_disgust|> They’re ugly
671,<|emo_disgust|> And they don ‘t even give him the benefit of a doubt
672,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, he did say something pretty awful about it being from his perspective."
674,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing they could come up with is a fake news article. There's no way they could do that.
675,<|emo_disgust|> That's a bit creepy.
676,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so passionate about this
677,<|emo_disgust|> And then there I was blaming the poor black lads
679,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is pretty damn awful on this. It's pathetic that he thinks he can run with a gun.
680,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so greedy right now
681,<|emo_disgust|> This is one of the worst I've seen...
682,<|emo_disgust|> What a weird thing to say.
683,<|emo_disgust|> This is so disgusting. I can’t imagine.
684,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting. Can't even look at it.
685,<|emo_disgust|> It definitely isn’t a surprise that so many young black men kill and eat white women. 
687,<|emo_disgust|> The comments on those videos are what started getting me. They're disgusting...
688,<|emo_disgust|> This is so creepy and weird. Eleven year olds are still creepy and weird.
689,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I miss that :(
690,<|emo_disgust|> > They do not go to college.
691,<|emo_disgust|> He’s such a fucking selfish prick. Giggles everytime his face is seen emo.
693,<|emo_disgust|> I didn't like Banderstach until [NAME] stabbed and killed one of my best friends
694,<|emo_disgust|> He is creepy
695,<|emo_disgust|> He's a moron.
696,"<|emo_disgust|> You have lost me, no words can describe the total shock this has sent through my body"
698,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm with you guys, shitty writers ruin books, why isn't that a thing more? "
699,<|emo_disgust|> I can't stand the smh ummmm
701,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], this is so incredibly infuriating "
702,"<|emo_disgust|> The reason I don't like it is because, because the ending is so awful."
704,"<|emo_disgust|> This is the kind of reply I get on facebook. Not to be taken seriously, but it makes me sick"
705,<|emo_disgust|> This is a hate sub
707,<|emo_disgust|> Well I hate when people get into personal attacks mode.
708,<|emo_disgust|> This is so cruel
709,<|emo_disgust|> No way. This needs a serious update
710,"<|emo_disgust|> When a girl tells me she likes me, and i feel like im creepy and stupid for telling ya "
711,<|emo_disgust|> They hate him because he told them the truth
712,<|emo_disgust|> People are going to hate that because it’s new information and will likely have some sort of negative connotation.
713,<|emo_disgust|> How come no one gave a shit about him getting fired?
716,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking hate [NAME]..
717,<|emo_disgust|> And then it’s removed and unless it’s extremely grave it’s never seen by [NAME]
718,<|emo_disgust|> You are creepy
719,<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting. He should be embarrassed.
720,<|emo_disgust|> This just gets worse and worse.
721,"<|emo_disgust|> Well no, you're lying lol"
722,<|emo_disgust|> There are racist morons everywhere.
723,<|emo_disgust|> This is the absolute worst.
724,<|emo_disgust|> Wow just wow
725,"<|emo_disgust|> How dare you, she is *27*. I have no fucking idea where you live. This fucken Canada."
726,<|emo_disgust|> That’s the worst possible outcome
727,<|emo_disgust|> He’s a little weird but I think I’d take him over [NAME] and [NAME] with the bigger injury concerns
728,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I have trust issues
729,"<|emo_disgust|> No problem, sorry for late response."
730,<|emo_disgust|> I’m one and this is disgusting for me
731,<|emo_disgust|> That’s awful. I really hope the DFL can pick up seats in the 6th now that [NAME] is injured...
732,<|emo_disgust|> Well that sucks. Time to move on and find someone who will.
733,<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting. He had reason to be concerned about the safety of others but he nonetheless acted anyway.
734,<|emo_disgust|> I was so pissed off when they blocked us. I’ve never been through that before.
735,<|emo_disgust|> The thing that bugs me the most about this whole situation is how calm and collected the company was.
736,<|emo_disgust|> Weird way to spell [NAME].
737,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful... That was a horrible call.
738,"<|emo_disgust|> My own girlfriend has said this to me ""he likes it when I tell him I love him too"""
740,<|emo_disgust|> That was brutal.
741,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a MOTHERFUCKER
742,<|emo_disgust|> Your brainwashing efforts have been nothing short of amazing. Now shut your mouth.
743,<|emo_disgust|> Damn it.
744,<|emo_disgust|> This is a perfect example of lazy writing. It's awful and only gets worse as you go along....
745,<|emo_disgust|> When did they start flying their drones in the rain...
746,<|emo_disgust|> This guy is a danger to himself and others.
747,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a horrible human Being
748,<|emo_disgust|> Lol...that’s so scary. I’m so sorry.
749,<|emo_disgust|> How the fuck do you moan tho
750,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that his sister is a porn star and a human being is pretty cringe.
751,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a moron.
752,<|emo_disgust|> You’re trash.
753,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, it's kind of creepy to assume that someone can only see you through your phone’s camera when you have a FaceTime in-app, sorry, I need to learn my place. "
754,<|emo_disgust|> That’s a rude way to spell [NAME] Smirk.
755,<|emo_disgust|> But the real problem lies with your last comment...
756,<|emo_disgust|> i feel this way because i am too trusting of people as they say themselves
757,<|emo_disgust|> My parents were both in the military so this was a no-no.
758,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]
759,<|emo_disgust|> Lol no wonder crime is going up if these morons are in charge.
760,<|emo_disgust|> That’s so disgusting.. You need to be physically removed from any situation to report that.
761,<|emo_disgust|> I would really like to see your work if you hadn’t given up and decided to travel
762,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is not afraid to say what he needs to say...
763,<|emo_disgust|> Those things are nasty.
764,<|emo_disgust|> You’re wrong. There are lots of ways to do this
766,<|emo_disgust|> That's ridiculous. Do you have proof of that?
767,<|emo_disgust|> That’s awful
768,<|emo_disgust|> That's actually a pretty weird way to type B
769,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, he was horrible on Sunday. "
770,"<|emo_disgust|> No, that is a lie. She did lie once and it was an exaggeration."
771,<|emo_disgust|> How scary!
772,<|emo_disgust|> Holy moly I hate [NAME] y'all are heroes
773,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you comment on a post that deals with child abuse. How dare you use your position of trust to encourage child abuse. Who the fuck comments on a post about child abuse? Your board is fucking retarded
774,<|emo_disgust|> This is one of the few times I've seen this meme get downvoted.
775,<|emo_disgust|> The dude was just awful.
776,"<|emo_disgust|> We got it, now can do with the rest."
777,<|emo_disgust|> This is my favorite wild memory
778,"<|emo_disgust|> He may be a nice guy, but that's just creepy."
779,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst thing I've ever seen. Take my upvote.
780,"<|emo_disgust|> I didn't like the park before it was developed, but I liked it after the developers improved it..."
781,<|emo_disgust|> That's so disgusting. You can tell that this person is deeply sincerely wrong.
782,<|emo_disgust|> That's the worst I've seen
783,<|emo_disgust|> This is a weird meme. When is [NAME] gonna get his shit together and realise he wrote it?
784,<|emo_disgust|> Who says cops can't do their job? I remember them beating that black kid so hard he had both hands up like *shit*
785,"<|emo_disgust|> It's a bit weird seeing as how we were both born in England then moved to America/ Australasia, are same age but differing further."
786,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that's some vicious catcalling you bro.
787,<|emo_disgust|> What the actual fuck
789,"<|emo_disgust|> So.... you could have said that but some ""intellectuals"" are weird"
790,<|emo_disgust|> You are disgusting.
791,<|emo_disgust|> I’d rather not have a sit down with her husband and have an argument.
792,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I always wondered what his middle name was.
793,"<|emo_disgust|> > She got angry when she realized that despite being a ""friend of"" a lot of people she actually isn't... and why > everyone thinks she sucks"
794,<|emo_disgust|> There's a special place in hell for u
795,<|emo_disgust|> We're gonna have a serious argument about who the real [NAME] is soon tbh
796,<|emo_disgust|> How about a new sub??? Like every other r/rareinsults subreddit!
797,<|emo_disgust|> I had a similar nightmare last night. It's even creepier when you're awake.
798,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, I’d rather be the first-year TE to miss a OT in two decades"
799,<|emo_disgust|> >I am the single worst worst manager...besides all the people I worked with. My lack of empathy and compassion for beings asible as myself.
801,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]? We'll just say we're against her and she'll be our dictator.
802,<|emo_disgust|> You're a monster!
803,<|emo_disgust|> The lack of options in this thread really makes me want to die
804,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like im being rude and annoying
805,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm a woman and I have said it before so it's not like I'm suddenly suddenly suddenly not afraid of dudes putting themselves in girls' shoes, you know."
806,<|emo_disgust|> I feel your pain... I have seen it done to me way too many times.
807,<|emo_disgust|> People have been posting these photos all over the place lately so I thought I would try and bring them all together here for easier access.
808,<|emo_disgust|> We will not be bullied by you for wanting to be a good person and have boundaries. Stop being so grand and grandiose about it.
810,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you
811,"<|emo_disgust|> Holy crap, that [NAME] trade really was bad. "
812,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was really bad today
813,"<|emo_disgust|> ""ia is no longer a friendly country."" The only insult that matters is insulting a country for its history and present functioning, cuz you're racist and a xenophobe. "
814,<|emo_disgust|> But it's so painful
816,<|emo_disgust|> This is an obnoxious and unnecessary expense. Stop using ridiculous examples.axiosa href http
818,<|emo_disgust|> It was a hit. I don’t like [NAME]. Now everyone is gonna hate [NAME] so much.
819,<|emo_disgust|> A shitty deal...ones for $100 but lets not meet here to hear how pathetic your life is
820,<|emo_disgust|> How dare he talk to the refs. It's as if he was an open book and couldn’t wait to get the call reversed.
822,<|emo_disgust|> This guy is going to the Browns at 11 and is going to be super pissed off if you do this to him.
823,<|emo_disgust|> That was brutal. Loved it
825,<|emo_disgust|> i had the feeling my husband had a terrible idea
827,"<|emo_disgust|> That's weird, I'm also kind of new there, so I didn't catch that."
828,<|emo_disgust|> This is worse than Derry. The only good thing about Dinions has been the horrible pensioners.
830,"<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. So, sorry if you heard that. Happy birthday!"
831,<|emo_disgust|> Lol your parents are assholes.
832,<|emo_disgust|> Because people hate freedom
833,"<|emo_disgust|> What? I’m just going to say that I’m disgusted that you’re going to talk about [NAME] instead of [NAME], and that’s a big enough statement to warrant a response."
834,<|emo_disgust|> The lack of female characters that can be objectified is really something. It's kinda sad.
835,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking douchebag.
836,<|emo_disgust|> Wow I don't remember ever having much of a taste for meat and now I'm wondering why I'm always so morbidly obese lol
837,<|emo_disgust|> This sub is becoming very anti-intellectual and skeptical. It seems more like geek culture than nerd culture. It s like our reality is more reality than [RELIGION]!
838,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking seriously.
840,<|emo_disgust|> i feel really annoyed
841,<|emo_disgust|> What the Fuck?
842,<|emo_disgust|> This poor janitor.
843,"<|emo_disgust|> But I would like some of you to do some extra research before you go on a trip. I've become quite fond of the area, but did someone else point you in the right direction?"
844,<|emo_disgust|> My heart melted omg [NAME]
847,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, she kinda looks like an action movie hero. It's uncanny"
848,<|emo_disgust|> She even threatened to sue.
849,<|emo_disgust|> He's only 35....time to change his stance. Stop talking about it
850,<|emo_disgust|> That’s disgusting
852,<|emo_disgust|> The saddest thing is that you think that saying 'by your side is the woman he fell in love with' is a 'line'
853,<|emo_disgust|> I'm saying it's the worst.
855,<|emo_disgust|> That one was me. I had tears of sadness and joy at the same time.
856,<|emo_disgust|> The people from Reddit who are upset about [NAME] getting a new car are very very bad at irony.
857,<|emo_disgust|> He got caught in a hail storm for using his cell phone while inside a Best Buy. RIP.
858,<|emo_disgust|> It’s a matter of opinion but I personally think [NAME] is better
859,"<|emo_disgust|> It's no wonder crime is going up, the government isn't keeping them well or funding them fairly."
860,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, he was, and he still is. ""I don't want to burden you with all of this"" is the reason people leave their jobs. "
861,<|emo_disgust|> > He's a freak That's pretty much all his argument is.
862,<|emo_disgust|> You can see how this could get weird really fast if they show any reaction time.
863,<|emo_disgust|> It's pretty fucking creepy
864,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fucking moron
865,<|emo_disgust|> Don't tell me what to do.
866,"<|emo_disgust|> The comment was so awful, I almost downvoted it out."
867,<|emo_disgust|> It is weird because this is how many of us left are doing this stuff.
868,<|emo_disgust|> In any other case the police investigation has already been terrible at finding out where the dump of waste is.
869,<|emo_disgust|> Weird way to spell 'wreck'
871,<|emo_disgust|> The one on the left looks like he's drinking the dog.
872,<|emo_disgust|> This could only get worse....i don’t even know what to do about it yet im so scared
873,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling a little bit frustrated
874,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fucking idiot and knows it but he wants us to believe it's not. That's incredibly dangerous
875,"<|emo_disgust|> It's not a ""when."" She has to contact you in person. You should feel awful."
876,<|emo_disgust|> Because there is no consistency in this roster. Absolutely zero creativity. Nothing goes.
877,<|emo_disgust|> Why is she not a horror?
878,<|emo_disgust|> i just feel a little bit overwhelmed
879,<|emo_disgust|> I can't even imagine how difficult it is to get a job that actually pays well. The absolute horror of it all.
880,"<|emo_disgust|> Fuck you, we need real jobs"
881,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a fucking idiot lol.
882,<|emo_disgust|> Don't blame me if it doesn't work out. You can go ahead and enjoy your ban.
883,<|emo_disgust|> This video is actually quite disturbing to me.
884,<|emo_disgust|> Holy fuck that was good
885,<|emo_disgust|> It was a horrible call
886,<|emo_disgust|> I mean there are a bunch of weirdo kids ranting and raving about how god made the earth and stuff.
887,<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting. Apt.
889,"<|emo_disgust|> You are a disgusting, lazy, gluttonous, lazy, greedy, miserly, envious, and prideful man."
890,<|emo_disgust|> That’s the worst possible outcome if he lives
891,<|emo_disgust|> This is the most dangerous thing I've ever made.
892,"<|emo_disgust|> Holy crap, is this from earlier this year? That would be a year ago in which she lost her shit."
893,<|emo_disgust|> i know and feel is a little weird
894,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking asshole lol
895,<|emo_disgust|> That’s a horrible take.
896,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a pro liar and a bully. Stop talking shite about ‘bullying’ and ‘bullying’ instead of ‘bullying’
897,"<|emo_disgust|> Just think of the kids. He took them all on the chin, wasn't he? Imagine the panic in the lockup if he just came in with all that empty space."
899,"<|emo_disgust|> My favorite is when [NAME] brings up [NAME] again, it’s so cringe."
900,<|emo_disgust|> Now THAT is a fucking murder by words!
901,<|emo_disgust|> This dude's Facebook post is an absolute embarrassment to the city of brotherly love.
902,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking creepy vibes [NAME] and [NAME] I just hope some of them caught him
903,"<|emo_disgust|> The fact that you think that is a ""thing"" is so disgusting that it verges on theinges."
904,<|emo_disgust|> That’s horrible... I felt the exact same thing when my sister came out
905,"<|emo_disgust|> The only way [NAME] does this is with a gun to his head. No, he wants you to see his fucking throat."
906,<|emo_disgust|> How come no one comments?
907,<|emo_disgust|> That's very scary.
908,<|emo_disgust|> The best defense is no offense. Shut up about [NAME] and [NAME] as much as possible. You have nothing to whine about and you're the one who got your ass handed to you
909,<|emo_disgust|> I am also tired and mouthy. I do try to answer as objectively as possible but can't stop myself from feeling smug. Lol
910,"<|emo_disgust|> No one who has seen this can be surprised, I am surprised it isn't from years ago"
911,<|emo_disgust|> You can't even make an informed donation to a cause if you're using an Amazon account.
912,<|emo_disgust|> What a complete and utter cunt.
913,<|emo_disgust|> They are very careful with their words.
914,<|emo_disgust|> What the actual fuck?
915,<|emo_disgust|> The new art style definitely has it's problems. Is it great? Absolutely not... Can it ever grow into something truly horrifying? Absolutely Absolutely not
917,<|emo_disgust|> They don't mind your junk!
918,<|emo_disgust|> That’s sick! How did you get in?
919,<|emo_disgust|> It was posted to instagram
920,<|emo_disgust|> So much guilt!
921,<|emo_disgust|> They play loud trap music that just sounds horrible.
922,<|emo_disgust|> People are making these kinds of ridiculous and offensive jokes about themselves almost daily. Howling at the top of your lungs just isn't tolerated.
923,<|emo_disgust|> Well that sucks I'll never be able with her.
924,<|emo_disgust|> This is awful deep. I think the only way to really make it worse is to keep the score at 0-100 all game.
925,<|emo_disgust|> What a hate sub
926,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck i love you prag
928,<|emo_disgust|> i feel insulted to see a bodyguard of someone so close to me
929,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit!!
930,<|emo_disgust|> > It's not the biggest movie I've ever seen but who woulda thought she was a pornstar.
931,<|emo_disgust|> The only reason you're in a shitty relationship is because you're in a shitty relationship.
933,"<|emo_disgust|> I find it quite disgusting that women can't read. Not that there isn't a number of women who can read, just that women can't read."
934,<|emo_disgust|> This is a good point and I agree with it because it bothers me a lot.
935,"<|emo_disgust|> This person is so incredibly stupid, but hilarious in a weird way. Thanks for the gold, OP. "
936,"<|emo_disgust|> If there is an actual sub for these stuff, I'm definitely open to it!"
937,"<|emo_disgust|> And even worse: ""He did it for a better life, he can't change it"" It's so pathetic."
938,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn people
939,<|emo_disgust|> That's a pretty lewd and disgusting amount of Sesame oil.
940,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, you're quite the romantic..."
941,<|emo_disgust|> This hurts to watch
942,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I thought I was the only one! :/
944,"<|emo_disgust|> It's a shame the US isn't a signatory; the EU is awful, but a country is legally bound to the rest of the world."
945,<|emo_disgust|> The real problem is the media themselves aren’t telling the truth about what really happened either.
947,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. :(
948,<|emo_disgust|> My condolences. I had no idea the scale of this loss. Stay strong!
949,"<|emo_disgust|> The first half was horrible, das auch."
951,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], I hate Twitter"
952,<|emo_disgust|> He must hate them
953,<|emo_disgust|> When your brain is so mush you can't reason and you just scream and rage
954,"<|emo_disgust|> If the dog is covered in filth, it's probably unclean. Not a good sign to look at."
955,<|emo_disgust|> Man I hate [NAME] so much.
956,<|emo_disgust|> She must really hate her father.
957,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] IS FREAKING THE HORN OUT OF HEART
958,<|emo_disgust|> i feel that you cant help but feel jealous
959,<|emo_disgust|> i feel less than hostile toward them
960,<|emo_disgust|> It's a miracle
961,<|emo_disgust|> She's going to kill you with her words anyway so...
962,<|emo_disgust|> I’m just pissed off at everything that has to do with my useless fave.
963,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] and I’m so jealous.
964,<|emo_disgust|> I don’t like sleeping in the couch :(
965,<|emo_disgust|> This is pretty ridiculous
966,<|emo_disgust|> It looks like garbage.
967,"<|emo_disgust|> No, it's not. He's wrong about it being a bad thing. He's just wrong on how it's done, by the way."
969,<|emo_disgust|> The real worst though is when people become angry at the person for asking a question without knowing the answers
970,<|emo_disgust|> This is horrible.
971,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] what the heck?
972,<|emo_disgust|> This is kinda creepy.
973,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird that this sub is more concerned with drama than actually covering the important shit.
974,<|emo_disgust|> Worst feeling ever
975,<|emo_disgust|> That would have been the worst hit in the history of TB.
976,<|emo_disgust|> Damn she didn't name her son after [NAME]. Maybe [NAME] had a thing for weird nicknames like that.
977,<|emo_disgust|> This is my ad for free on xbox live
978,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, is that normal? Am I the only one who feels this way? A little weird for us. Hopefully it gets better for you."
979,"<|emo_disgust|> You don't hate [NAME] at all, you just want him gone."
980,<|emo_disgust|> But all those suits have bad airscraping.
982,<|emo_disgust|> i want to feel disgusted with life
984,<|emo_disgust|> Wow that’s just...seriously awful.
985,<|emo_disgust|> And that's without getting to the part where [NAME] said he was sorry.
986,<|emo_disgust|> How disgusting.
987,<|emo_disgust|> It seems that you have ignored the harsh words from your father.
988,<|emo_disgust|> This looks like total garbage.
989,<|emo_disgust|> I want this poster so bad. If it's 12% off it's not bad at all.
990,<|emo_disgust|> You're an awful human being.
991,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] that fucking face
992,<|emo_disgust|> I just hope she doesn't get her feelings hurt accidentally.
993,<|emo_disgust|> And yet the Knicks have the worst record in the league despite having the 2nd best player in the universe and the 3rd best coach in the league... how odd
994,<|emo_disgust|> That's true in one way but it's also true in another.
995,<|emo_disgust|> It's a weird thing to be afraid of.
997,<|emo_disgust|> That guy looks like he just went inside a bank and got his money.
998,<|emo_disgust|> They were not impressed.
999,<|emo_disgust|> Now this I like.
1000,<|emo_disgust|> That’s bad
1001,<|emo_disgust|> That face is SO staring... I hate it.
1003,<|emo_disgust|> So [NAME] has some very questionable defensive instincts.
1004,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling a gentle tingling just behind my left ear
1006,"<|emo_disgust|> My favorite thing is when [NAME] invokes some sort of surrealist wisdom, it actually makes me laugh."
1007,"<|emo_disgust|> The whole ""I don't have food for preference"" thing is sickening."
1008,"<|emo_disgust|> You're right. He did say it while looking at a mirror... which is weird, is a fact of life."
1009,<|emo_disgust|> He is a moron...
1010,<|emo_disgust|> She's got a horrible chance at being elected. She has a track record...vote her out
1011,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah. Stupid science.
1012,<|emo_disgust|> That is absolutely disgusting. VWP
1013,<|emo_disgust|> Lol my poor cat
1014,"<|emo_disgust|> If I hear [NAME] on the radio while I'm getting married, I'm gonna go off like a rocket andosh right through the door like a bullet"
1016,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not going to be offended by that.
1018,<|emo_disgust|> So much bullshit.
1019,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fucking bummer.
1020,<|emo_disgust|> Lol I’m sorry.
1021,"<|emo_disgust|> I've also heard that some parents will make the mistake of letting their 8 year old drop a ""MONEY CANADA"" or similar onto the kitchen counter, just to be extra rude. "
1022,"<|emo_disgust|> And so is your roommate. Be well and stay safe, bud"
1023,"<|emo_disgust|> That was an ugly, intentional foul by [NAME], and the refs really just weren't very good in that situation."
1024,<|emo_disgust|> Fuckin em
1025,<|emo_disgust|> Your company sucks.
1026,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so disgusted in my own country
1027,<|emo_disgust|> No they're just horrible.
1028,"<|emo_disgust|> And his suit says ""I have a claim to fame - actor [NAME]""..fuck"
1029,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a miserable cuck
1030,<|emo_disgust|> That’s a terrible number
1031,<|emo_disgust|> That face...its as creepy as hell.
1032,<|emo_disgust|> Don't read into it too much. There's no reason for reading it as some sort of attack on the white race.
1033,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird flex, but okay"
1034,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst I've seen
1036,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh god, yes. In my worst nightmares I've had people do these things. It's so awful"
1037,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful because I love your username
1038,<|emo_disgust|> Because when you believe in bullshit you should be ashamed of your gullibility and blind hatred for humanity... You're just a bit better than [NAME].
1040,"<|emo_disgust|> The amount of bullshit that starts ""applying to studies"" is mind boggling."
1041,<|emo_disgust|> It's so disgusting that this comment is still happening. Reminds me of my mother.
1042,<|emo_disgust|> We should kill all children
1043,<|emo_disgust|> But it looks so damn cool
1044,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird to see [NAME] on the Nuge. He has looked awful tonight, maybe I'm wrong"
1046,<|emo_disgust|> Those subs...wtf
1047,<|emo_disgust|> I've never valued my life so highly
1048,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]. I am so sorry that you were abused as a child. There is so much more that can be done to help abused children. Hope you are doing better now! Hugs
1049,<|emo_disgust|> That's really sad. I'm so sorry
1050,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, how'd you get a hold of such a thing? "
1051,<|emo_disgust|> It’s crazy how quick people are to judge. It’s like everyone has a Twitter account and does the same thing.
1052,<|emo_disgust|> There is a weird cult that worships [NAME]. You can go to their website and it's horrifying.
1053,<|emo_disgust|> That head must hurt!
1054,"<|emo_disgust|> You know, it really is all the rage these days to downvote all out of hand anyone who disagrees with a post or what has to do with racism!"
1055,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], how awful."
1056,<|emo_disgust|> I really hate the New England Patriots.
1057,"<|emo_disgust|> I can understand if you were feeling very outraged by the above,but that isn't what this is about. I hope you will support civil and equal rights for all"
1058,<|emo_disgust|> You're horrible
1059,<|emo_disgust|> That was worse than a movie jump scare. I think I just saw my own brain
1060,<|emo_disgust|> She should not have had the temerity to have such high expectations for herself. She might not be strong in the first place but she definitely has the heart of a lioness.
1062,<|emo_disgust|> I really hate [NAME]. His face is so fucking horrendous
1066,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Stop spamming my junk"" or something."
1067,<|emo_disgust|> A little bit of sniffing around would've revealed that this is a fake. Pretty scary.
1068,<|emo_disgust|> Not true at all
1069,"<|emo_disgust|> If this is true, what a nightmare. I really hope you get justice but this hurts too much. "
1070,<|emo_disgust|> But he just lost his mind on the goal line and it’s none of your business.
1071,<|emo_disgust|> How could that possibly be terrible? I'd love to check out some of their other stuff if they ever do decide to put out new material
1072,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck it. I might as well just go ahead and say fuck it
1073,<|emo_disgust|> Well it looks like a fake but we aren't taking it lying down unfortunately
1074,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't care if it's a terrible thing to say, you're entitled to your opinion."
1076,<|emo_disgust|> They took the picture without the wedding dress!
1078,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has really been making some people a little uncomfortable. I have a lot of respect for him.
1080,<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck does this even mean? I can't even begin to understand it
1081,<|emo_disgust|> That's fucking creepy.
1082,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fucking monster I feel so fucking bad for his mom
1083,<|emo_disgust|> The guy that assaulted you is also a bit of a creep...
1084,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not trying to say I'm better than the buffoon; just that he is way more dangerous than arents
1085,<|emo_disgust|> In my worst nightmares I had an idea for how [NAME] got his ass kicked by [NAME] but this is better than the original
1086,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking piece of shit.
1087,<|emo_disgust|> He’s an angry elf
1088,<|emo_disgust|> Why oh why oh why is she wearing a thong?! It's not like there's anything wrong with that
1089,<|emo_disgust|> It was a joke...
1090,<|emo_disgust|> My god how awful
1091,<|emo_disgust|> I’m a racist.
1092,<|emo_disgust|> He is the father of two murdered black teenagers. This is just disgusting.
1093,<|emo_disgust|> This guy is disgusting.
1094,<|emo_disgust|> It's not so much the content - but the way they're presented. It's just an incredibly shoddily prepared docudrama with an awful structure.
1095,<|emo_disgust|> She's a disgusting piece of shit.
1096,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, even when they aren't channeling satan, they sure are annoying"
1097,<|emo_disgust|> I have a deep seeded hatred for close-minded people too.
1098,<|emo_disgust|> What the hell did I just read?
1099,<|emo_disgust|> And we knew the last movie had a fucking problem with poor writing.
1100,<|emo_disgust|> This man is a sex crimes suspect and should be looked into.
1101,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is having the wrong tattoo at the wrong time.
1102,<|emo_disgust|> Holy crap!!
1103,<|emo_disgust|> And it wouldn’t be any less disgusting than the [NAME] situation. What a joke.
1104,"<|emo_disgust|> That's weird, you probably live in a fairly relaxed society. Where people are more likely to call for help when they're sick."
1107,<|emo_disgust|> But that sounds awful.
1108,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah just horrible.
1109,"<|emo_disgust|> This isn't even a satire, it is a hate blog."
1110,<|emo_disgust|> I'm tired of this ridiculousness.
1111,<|emo_disgust|> You were about to lose your shit LOL
1112,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds awful. I hope you and them aren’t burdened by the thought that might happen
1113,<|emo_disgust|> Shut up [NAME]. The spastic autism kid probably needs a while to recover from that shit after he physically assaulted that man.
1114,<|emo_disgust|> Oh wow. Noted
1115,<|emo_disgust|> If the [RELIGION] is not what you want to believe then you can find plenty to agree with you on.
1116,<|emo_disgust|> It would be pretty bizarre if something as bad as this existed before Reddit existed...
1117,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] just needs to get back into the flow of the team.. she's been an absolute rock the last couple years
1118,<|emo_disgust|> That's not a fucking card I'm dealing.
1119,<|emo_disgust|> It’s so damn creepy
1120,<|emo_disgust|> It’s terrible what they do to these animals but then again maybe it’s worse than the people doing it. Who’s against animal rights?
1122,"<|emo_disgust|> Man I wish that were real life, I would have given that shit a shot."
1123,<|emo_disgust|> They're probably right! Weird.
1124,<|emo_disgust|> I am literally the worst.
1125,<|emo_disgust|> Damn you are autistic
1127,"<|emo_disgust|> ""SJW's out there somewhere, I don't know about you but I want to go find the one with no balls who can MAGA"""
1129,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating. What? Why are you offended?
1130,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], this IS the nba not a jersey.... how incredibly stupid."
1131,<|emo_disgust|> The comment was so dumb and offensive
1132,<|emo_disgust|> It’s a terrible law
1133,<|emo_disgust|> There are more important things to worry about
1134,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that’s straight up. I got you bro
1136,<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting. He should be embarrassed.
1137,<|emo_disgust|> Those are some stinky conditions you have there.
1139,"<|emo_disgust|> You know, even though the U.S. is majority white, its also a racist country. There is racism without the KKK and lynch mobs."
1142,"<|emo_disgust|> I’m with you. A messy apartment is making me feel very unwelcome in the city and in my own home town. If I could go back in time, I’ll complain about that too"
1143,<|emo_disgust|> You're still a big stupidass for posting those pics
1144,<|emo_disgust|> The thing to understand about this is that the internet hates [NAME] and/or [NAME].
1145,<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting. You'd think that's only happened in films!
1146,"<|emo_disgust|> The ""I don't care"" argument is probably the dumbest thing I've seen on this thread yet"
1147,"<|emo_disgust|> I’ll be honest with you, I haven't played enough with them to really gauge their true worth. "
1148,<|emo_disgust|> I hate when mom and dad fight.
1149,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I'm so sorry for your loss.
1150,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] this is why we have no confidence in our head coach.
1151,<|emo_disgust|> That's pretty lewd.
1152,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is when people say “allergy is a thing of the past” when it’s not. People need to stop expecting things to be vaccinated.
1153,<|emo_disgust|> That scene really just proves they had a weird relationship.
1154,<|emo_disgust|> i feel a little less cranky
1155,<|emo_disgust|> Weird because i use and-ass pencils both today but it was just a few years ago that i could do that lol.
1156,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] just doesn’t like drama. She hates everything about it. She’s never wrong.
1158,<|emo_disgust|> We all feel inadequate when it comes to our knowledge and experience
1159,<|emo_disgust|> Because people are uncomfortable with being called ugly
1160,<|emo_disgust|> It would give an absolutely insane range of motion and move things around super slowly
1161,<|emo_disgust|> i was feeling extremely angry
1162,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird, I went to the gym a lot and didn’t notice the difference."
1164,<|emo_disgust|> So it's even worse than I thought.
1165,<|emo_disgust|> Why did I just downvote your comment? You are not a fan. /s
1166,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that’s gonna be a testical travesty for [NAME] if he doesn’t apologize
1167,<|emo_disgust|> But that makes sense because when it's someone with a gun and a plan [NAME] is not.
1168,<|emo_disgust|> I'd give all the gold teeth I have for that movie
1169,"<|emo_disgust|> No surprise, we have a history of terrible foreign policy."
1170,<|emo_disgust|> I’m on the receiving end of the worst phone call ever. Tell your boss I was being awful
1171,<|emo_disgust|> Because in some cases parents are simply using their power and wisdom to provide for their own children and in some cases that is child abuse?
1172,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] can't have kids
1173,<|emo_disgust|> How incredibly dangerous and reckless
1174,<|emo_disgust|> Your husband is a disturbed individual. You need to get the help and the support you need.
1175,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck yeah boys let’s go
1176,"<|emo_disgust|> I knew this game would suck, but I was wrong. Gotta give it some serious consideration."
1177,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] the scum of the earth
1178,"<|emo_disgust|> No we don't! The lefties are going to claim victory and say ""Hang on a second we didnt!"""
1181,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, he was. I'm surprised he didn't say something about his lousy contract situation. "
1182,<|emo_disgust|> Because you are stupid.
1185,<|emo_disgust|> You’re a horrible human being.
1187,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Greed is an illness, and the only cure is more government."""
1188,<|emo_disgust|> This game is trash. end of level 20 is just as bad as the last one.
1189,<|emo_disgust|> What the actual fuck? I thought he was the one who hated them after they asked him what his deal was
1190,<|emo_disgust|> i feel very agitated im trying to keep it under control i would like to know exactly what is happening around me
1191,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds awful. I'm with you it is horrible.
1192,<|emo_disgust|> He really doesn’t know how to use his “nose”
1193,<|emo_disgust|> My condolences.
1194,<|emo_disgust|> She should be able to afford her child's education.
1195,<|emo_disgust|> It's more like you're not very smart or experienced.
1196,<|emo_disgust|> And the guy outside that gas station doesn’t realize you’re also a criminal?
1197,<|emo_disgust|> That's terrible. I'm sorry for your loss.
1198,<|emo_disgust|> It's still creepy and weird
1199,<|emo_disgust|> > [NAME] This is why I love Reddit.
1200,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird, no. To be a weirdo you have to be a mix between Incel and Weirdo"
1201,<|emo_disgust|> There is no way around it but to put up a big and obnoxious sign saying “we have sex all the time” will get a lot more people talking to you then just “we had sex all the time”
1202,<|emo_disgust|> i was feeling quite frustrated and had very little sleep
1204,<|emo_disgust|> Don't be a [NAME]
1205,<|emo_disgust|> It's disgusting how isolated some countries can be
1206,<|emo_disgust|> We did it again with [NAME]. [NAME] is a sore loser and youve proven that again. It's time for him to step down
1207,<|emo_disgust|> I've never seen a more ridiculous argument.
1208,<|emo_disgust|> We're not living in the 21st century. We're living in the 2nd century.
1210,"<|emo_disgust|> This is just so disgusting. This is so disgusting. These are some bad, disgusting things. We gotta get their parents on our side!... Nope."
1211,<|emo_disgust|> Your friend's a weirdo.
1212,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling very annoyed these days
1213,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] what a piece of shit.
1215,<|emo_disgust|> We need to pressure the Chinese government to not give theseposts over to Taiwanese control
1216,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't mind the odd vegan, but I think there should be some form of ""vegan only"" ban on meat, as there's just no argument for animal cruelty here."
1217,<|emo_disgust|> No. Not really cringe. Just sad.
1218,<|emo_disgust|> He’s a moron. Look at this lousy argument.
1219,<|emo_disgust|> Those lips...those horrible lips
1220,<|emo_disgust|> The reason I love hockey so much? Because I never saw any goal where [NAME] wasn't on the ice. Just unbelievable.
1221,"<|emo_disgust|> I feel really bad for the [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME] out there getting nothing done"
1222,"<|emo_disgust|> If the guy who gives the impression is any better at being a man, I'm worried the whole rotten karma scam thing has begun."
1223,<|emo_disgust|> Oh no.
1224,<|emo_disgust|> The amount of cringe they get for saying that is damn disgusting.
1225,<|emo_disgust|> My wife is 10 years older than me and she just doesn't age well. I appreciate it.
1226,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating. I hate Twitter
1228,<|emo_disgust|> I've watched enough news today to know there are some really awful things going on in Turkey.
1229,<|emo_disgust|> You don't know what you're talking about... I've seen it.
1230,"<|emo_disgust|> That's the most disgusting, vile, disgusting shade of lipstick she could possibly apply"
1231,<|emo_disgust|> That'll take something an awful lot worse than them.
1232,<|emo_disgust|> This is the saddest thing I've seen today. I hope it's because it's true.
1234,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, if we had it back then. It would have lifted me out of a depression I had for years!"
1235,<|emo_disgust|> If you are an actual anti-Semite what are you.
1236,<|emo_disgust|> Those fucken tires
1237,<|emo_disgust|> How about [NAME] instead. He's a fucking asshole.
1239,<|emo_disgust|> I'm a human being for a freaking second then there's a problem
1240,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is bad.... move him to left wide
1242,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, the way they write and draw it is really horrible."
1243,"<|emo_disgust|> The sad thing is, if you don't support it, there is no way of appeal."
1244,<|emo_disgust|> This is what I love about cats
1245,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] why you have to lie?
1246,<|emo_disgust|> What? No deal? Shhh keep quiet!
1247,<|emo_disgust|> Oh man she was so hot
1248,<|emo_disgust|> That was a terrible open shot....
1249,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I love Reddit.
1250,<|emo_disgust|> i have been feeling very dissatisfied with my life in general
1251,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucken n
1252,<|emo_disgust|> I feel like most Reddit subs are way more into irony than sarcasm. I guess I just have a bad social media presence.
1253,<|emo_disgust|> This is absolutely wild.
1254,<|emo_disgust|> That guy saw the light and turned around. Not that he's much for society either.
1255,<|emo_disgust|> Oh. You're one disgusting human being.
1256,<|emo_disgust|> I am a risk-taker. I will always pay the high price for risk.
1257,"<|emo_disgust|> No wonder there are so many fake ngg fanarts out there, there's gotta be more than that. Fuck off."
1259,<|emo_disgust|> Man I love your baby😍
1260,<|emo_disgust|> This is creepy
1261,<|emo_disgust|> I'm so sorry
1262,<|emo_disgust|> He'll probably try to sell you on some bullshit ass fake bullshit he's writing about [NAME] but you won't believe some of it
1264,<|emo_disgust|> The worst of it all. When your whole life depends on your credit score.
1267,<|emo_disgust|> I’m a woman (45) and it’s hands down The third periodiest year of my life. I’m terrified every week.
1268,<|emo_disgust|> I didn’t think to look it up’s just stupid girls
1269,<|emo_disgust|> My ex has basically become a complete slob since we broke up. I cant stand the way she treats me.
1270,<|emo_disgust|> This guy looks like the creepiest creep im embarrassed by his body type.
1271,<|emo_disgust|> It’s so creepy
1272,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking hate [NAME]
1273,<|emo_disgust|> i feel annoyed and angry and sad that she has the earrings that i want
1274,<|emo_disgust|> This shirt is directly aimed at some extremely ugly individuals
1275,"<|emo_disgust|> This is how they get the most out of these crazy animals. We're the worst, ugh."
1276,<|emo_disgust|> Lol...I’m too wee to vote...
1277,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds awful. I'm sorry for your loss.
1278,<|emo_disgust|> That face really does look child-like to me.
1279,<|emo_disgust|> I would say fuck him. My dad works for Nasa too. Fuck off.
1281,<|emo_disgust|> But then when this happened my life began to revolve around that monster!
1282,<|emo_disgust|> My dad got into politics and resigned in disgrace after years of being unduly harsh on his wife's behavior and campaign literature.
1283,<|emo_disgust|> The worst.
1284,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, I know what it's like to be the butt of so many jokes. Still lmao. "
1286,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck those calls
1287,<|emo_disgust|> Damn you are right.
1288,<|emo_disgust|> Weird how they feel the need to announce themselves
1289,"<|emo_disgust|> That's why I've decided to become a [NAME] instead of a PR. [NAME] I love my country, it'll be interesting to see if I become one. "
1290,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh god, they were so awful back in the day."
1291,<|emo_disgust|> > No fucking clue What the fuck? I don't even understand that thread either
1292,<|emo_disgust|> Oof lmao sorry if I said that. But I could’t help myself from laughing at this
1293,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, I wish there was a tool that looked like a pizza delivery dude but instead there’s “paste bomb” 😢"
1295,<|emo_disgust|> What an ugly fuk
1296,<|emo_disgust|> Wow... sounds sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
1297,<|emo_disgust|> Worst winter ever :(
1298,"<|emo_disgust|> And yet, still, somehow, I remain angry at her."
1300,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a pro-Assad piece of shit.
1301,<|emo_disgust|> i began feeling a little dissatisfied with myself and started getting angry at myself for having allowed myself to become this way
1302,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that you think like this is cause for extreme concern.
1303,<|emo_disgust|> Those damn tires
1304,<|emo_disgust|> The dude just needs to get off the phone and apologise.
1306,<|emo_disgust|> She’s ugly
1307,<|emo_disgust|> And [NAME] in the worst ways ever
1308,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, goodness!"
1309,"<|emo_disgust|> My god it has no fucking ending, what is with the musical chairs?"
1310,<|emo_disgust|> That was pure brutality. No doubt in my mind that man was intent on doing more than simplyeding out trash.
1311,<|emo_disgust|> The saddest part is how proud [NAME] looks at all of this...
1312,<|emo_disgust|> This is just a badly worded accusation.
1313,<|emo_disgust|> Worst dad ever!
1315,<|emo_disgust|> I'm getting old.
1316,"<|emo_disgust|> Shut up, [NAME]. "
1317,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh my god, ok. Thank you! "
1318,"<|emo_disgust|> Those are some weird, sweaty, tan headdresses."
1319,"<|emo_disgust|> There are racists in this world, yes. But the racist here is so far worse."
1320,"<|emo_disgust|> I hope it was the other way around... I mean, she hates the person and wants them dead... not to mention they are a zombie..."
1321,<|emo_disgust|> You die
1322,<|emo_disgust|> Fuuuuck that’s rough
1323,"<|emo_disgust|> It’s not a big deal, but I hate it more than I love it."
1324,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird, he is in his early 40's already."
1325,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is horrible
1326,<|emo_disgust|> Just stop.
1327,<|emo_disgust|> i was not there at all when his house burned down and i was not disappointed that he blamed me
1328,<|emo_disgust|> How could you tell? The mouth is a weird mouth shape.
1329,"<|emo_disgust|> It's disgusting. Not just disgusting, but absolutely infuriating that these people are so blind to any kind of common sense."
1330,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, that took a weird turn."
1331,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is when they say a politician is a 'leader' because they are.
1332,<|emo_disgust|> I'm ashamed I thought it was that big of a deal
1333,<|emo_disgust|> Oi he got stabbed in the eye
1334,<|emo_disgust|> We're stupid
1335,"<|emo_disgust|> It's kinda like the 'fuck it, I'll put a redX on it' option."
1336,"<|emo_disgust|> No, he didn't. I'm just saying the same thing. You're too stupid to have any thought behind it..."
1337,<|emo_disgust|> We're still doing this shit though :(
1338,<|emo_disgust|> You don't have to be perfect to cry on the subway. Stop thinking there's a difference.
1339,<|emo_disgust|> She might just be a weirdo. Try talking to her honestly. Don't make them fight. She might just be that way at times.
1340,<|emo_disgust|> i feel very insecure and like to hide it behind a mask
1341,<|emo_disgust|> I'm so sad.
1342,"<|emo_disgust|> I'd say it's still a bit weird, but I was ataper in college..."
1343,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that’s a great idea
1345,<|emo_disgust|> This just makes me want to die
1346,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] can't make passes even when he has the ball in his hands!?!?!?!
1347,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so wronged
1348,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck [NAME] for continuing to give her a platform.
1349,<|emo_disgust|> It’s okay if it’s a man telling a man how to dress.. men are just as creepy
1351,"<|emo_disgust|> But since you're angry, I'm not going to listen to complain about it."
1352,"<|emo_disgust|> You're not alone, it's that ugly truth all the more apparent to a world accustomed to hearing it."
1353,"<|emo_disgust|> It's so fucking creepy, honestly."
1354,"<|emo_disgust|> I have no idea what is going on, but damn, the [NAME] are getting harrassed for having the foresight to wait until 3am to post thos comments...."
1355,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I have found my calling"""
1356,<|emo_disgust|> Just wondering why you're so angry???
1357,<|emo_disgust|> You're a horrible person.
1358,<|emo_disgust|> Oh my gosh!!!!!!!!! 😭
1359,<|emo_disgust|> It's a weird thing to say.
1360,<|emo_disgust|> It seems very likely that this is exactly what the Democrats are doing. The Dems are scared that a lot of these people could become swing voters later.
1361,<|emo_disgust|> I want to explain my feelings to this man. It is so infuriating. I hope he can forgive me.
1362,<|emo_disgust|> That was a brutal goal. Fucking near decides goals.
1363,"<|emo_disgust|> You're not his wife, you're his girlfriend. You don't have to backpedal on it"
1364,"<|emo_disgust|> You know, I’d be very, very worried if that was true. She’s the most important person of all time, I’m so sad it’s all happening to her."
1365,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, isn't this cool."
1366,<|emo_disgust|> This is beautiful.
1368,<|emo_disgust|> What a bummer that [NAME] can't space and [NAME] isn't being more selfish and checking in from time to time.
1369,<|emo_disgust|> You're weird.
1370,<|emo_disgust|> This is stupid?
1371,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, look at that body."
1373,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah even worse.
1374,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fucking piece of shit.
1375,"<|emo_disgust|> Just because you have opinions doesn't mean you have a right to those opinions. If you don't have a right to your opinion, it's not something to be passionate about."
1376,<|emo_disgust|> That’s awful advice.
1377,"<|emo_disgust|> It’s not just me, this guy is making me very anxious, very depressed "
1378,<|emo_disgust|> That is horrible. He is a good friend to me and I’m so sorry for what happened.
1379,"<|emo_disgust|> He really isn't. When it isn't a violent game, it's porn."
1381,<|emo_disgust|> Oh stop IT
1382,<|emo_disgust|> This is so Dope and so Right!!!
1383,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is running away from a monster.
1384,<|emo_disgust|> It’s no surprise then he’s against women.
1385,"<|emo_disgust|> >""Fuck up"" Now that is a good one"
1386,<|emo_disgust|> What an idiot lol
1387,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I’m afraid to fly.
1388,<|emo_disgust|> > So disgusting that you're comfortable with this. Extremely disgusting.
1389,"<|emo_disgust|> The most recent issue doesn’t offer this, sorry."
1390,<|emo_disgust|> What in the actual fuck....
1391,"<|emo_disgust|> I’m with you,onna be a bitch tho 😤"
1392,"<|emo_disgust|> i really dont agree with her here, but i really do."
1393,"<|emo_disgust|> And you're not fat, you're an idiot lol. "
1394,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so tortured just thinking about it
1395,<|emo_disgust|> She was also found guilty of neglecting to give her a copy of the list.
1396,<|emo_disgust|> I'm fucking starving here.
1398,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is when everyone thinks you're exactly the same
1399,"<|emo_disgust|> How dare you suggest I'm ugly! out of focus, useless, useless..."
1400,<|emo_disgust|> This is one of the ugliest things I've ever seen.
1402,<|emo_disgust|> i get the feeling they want to protect something or someone but not the people themselves
1404,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm a woman. I don't like penis in my vagina. So, please don't tell me how to think."
1405,<|emo_disgust|> This is amazing. I love this.
1406,<|emo_disgust|> How are they not. They're disgusting.
1407,<|emo_disgust|> People get this kinda thing super hard and it really sucks. Can you give useful advice?
1408,"<|emo_disgust|> So, now we're saying [NAME] aren't virtuous."
1409,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, and I hate that myself"
1410,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I wish I had a way to send him an emoji. Maybe we’d do that?
1411,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] this is disgusting
1412,"<|emo_disgust|> Because [NAME] is a lying, cheating, enabler for [NAME] to be in this position."
1413,"<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I'm sorry you had that experience, but yeah, they're a cult that can be really hard to leave. "
1414,<|emo_disgust|> Why does everyone think he's so cool? Does he really come out with any real music anymore?
1415,<|emo_disgust|> It's also incredibly rude as well.
1416,"<|emo_disgust|> Worst case scenario, he was an attractive young man."
1417,<|emo_disgust|> You want to give me a chance but you don’t understand my situation.
1418,<|emo_disgust|> You should have asked that question years ago?
1419,<|emo_disgust|> That is very creepy.
1420,<|emo_disgust|> I want it to be so terrible that [NAME] is playing.
1421,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, that was awful. I thought it was pretty safe until you said, ""I want it badly"" "
1422,<|emo_disgust|> I was wondering that as well. I know the game was bad but I'm still super pissed they won after going on 20+ possessions.
1423,<|emo_disgust|> The secondhand panic and embarrassment I feel from this is astounding
1425,<|emo_disgust|> That is a lot of karma.
1427,<|emo_disgust|> Wow that’s a very old wives story. Where do I sign?
1428,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm a 25m away from being that, I'm just mad because I didn't think about it properly!"
1429,<|emo_disgust|> Well.... fuck
1430,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds a little paranoid
1431,<|emo_disgust|> I did everything else I could think of to avoid them this season. That's a guilt I carry.
1432,<|emo_disgust|> The media itself is a huge problem. Just look at all the stories and photos that have nothing to do with [NAME] story except maybe to show hate for him
1433,<|emo_disgust|> That is awful. :(
1434,<|emo_disgust|> You're a fucking idiot
1435,"<|emo_disgust|> This is not just ""got hurt"" but actually aggravated my back the other day."
1436,<|emo_disgust|> But [NAME] has a weird ass name.
1438,<|emo_disgust|> I think all media should be ashamed for having a presence at a racist and sexist event
1439,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, you're going crazy. Go get checked out."
1440,<|emo_disgust|> That’s so disgusting.agulous
1441,<|emo_disgust|> That was truly disgusting
1442,<|emo_disgust|> Because you don't deserve to have a voice.
1443,<|emo_disgust|> There are people here that actually believe you're a terrible person because you're not a [RELIGION]ist.
1444,<|emo_disgust|> So disgusting. VWP
1445,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is scared out there. Give him [NAME] and [NAME] (ie atleast 2 DBs)
1446,<|emo_disgust|> If she is under the impression that you are then she isn't being open with you
1447,<|emo_disgust|> They are a dangerous breed.
1448,<|emo_disgust|> Wow. What a waste of plastic.
1449,<|emo_disgust|> She’s horrible
1451,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was actually the worst Of any sports team Unis!!!
1452,"<|emo_disgust|> I’m sorry that you did, but if you were to die for his crimes you would be protected from him in some way..."
1453,<|emo_disgust|> Oh damn it!
1454,<|emo_disgust|> Those are some heavy bags...
1455,<|emo_disgust|> It's creepy that she's a bioware guy.
1456,<|emo_disgust|> It just seems wrong. It's like saying you have no shame.
1457,<|emo_disgust|> I agree. He’s a very dangerous man. I hate the media but sometimes I really do.
1458,<|emo_disgust|> Oh you awful girl
1459,<|emo_disgust|> They’re so mean! Good riddance to evil! Just move on bro.
1460,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I hate Reddit.
1461,"<|emo_disgust|> No offense, but your parents are assholes."
1462,<|emo_disgust|> That’s so sick. That is so sick. You have no shame.
1463,"<|emo_disgust|> No, you literally just posted something that can be summed up in one sentence: Fuck off. "
1465,<|emo_disgust|> i feel the cold more much more now and i cant stand the sun
1466,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I didn’t think about that. Thanks.
1467,"<|emo_disgust|> Don't read into it too much. He really doesn't care that much. Just a guy with a weird obsession with finding the ""right"" women."
1468,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating. I thought you were the one ranting about how horrible [NAME] is.
1469,<|emo_disgust|> This is the weirdest thing I've seen on this thread yet
1470,"<|emo_disgust|> I was gonna call them late, but I'm kind of mad cuz I was gonna have a decent picture of the dog."
1471,<|emo_disgust|> He is in his late 30s already. Who the hell thought he was worth it.
1472,<|emo_disgust|> What are you talking about - your claim is 100% BS.
1473,<|emo_disgust|> The most hated team in the nfl is the Cowboys.
1474,<|emo_disgust|> You can't pick and choose racism you dippy cunt
1475,<|emo_disgust|> i just can t imagine being in that situation and just feeling completely disgusted and ashamed all at the same time
1476,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] what a disgusting lass!
1477,"<|emo_disgust|> How dare they ask me to ""read the letter before you eat it""? I'll eat anything in sight!"
1478,<|emo_disgust|> Omg this is just so infuriating.
1479,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking hate [NAME] [NAME].
1482,<|emo_disgust|> It wouldn't be hard to figure out a bug in the game that would cause him to die if used correctly.
1483,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I'm sick of seeing stupid meme stashes around, this one was particularly bad."
1484,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing better than this cringe would be a fucking video about [NAME]!
1485,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck off. Stay in your fucking car.
1486,<|emo_disgust|> But we will :(
1487,<|emo_disgust|> You’re an awful human being.
1488,<|emo_disgust|> You can't really know what someone is saying without them backing you up with proof.
1489,"<|emo_disgust|> Lol, you are stupid for trusting them at all!"
1490,"<|emo_disgust|> If you don't like the taste of weed, you'll also like the taste of rape."
1491,<|emo_disgust|> The real worst thing about this is how many people haven’t seen it yet
1493,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], I have never hated anyone as much as this."
1494,<|emo_disgust|> The [NAME] man is bad.. I hope he doesn't get any worse....
1495,<|emo_disgust|> We don't. People are idiots.
1496,"<|emo_disgust|> So you are literally a [RELIGION] hate-spewing, racist, sexist, nationalistic hoe? Wow, I am shocked that you still have faith."
1497,"<|emo_disgust|> Don't worry, [NAME], [NAME] never said that. "
1498,<|emo_disgust|> They hate him too.
1499,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit bro
1500,<|emo_disgust|> I don't care about them being rich; what bothers me is that they don't care about human beings
1501,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like the people that are not against me are the ones that are mad at all of us for not being married
1502,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting. It's almost as if they are implying that any sexual tension between them will somehow doom them to ruin...ridiculous
1503,<|emo_disgust|> The worst part is people think they are so clever....
1504,<|emo_disgust|> i was feeling really bitchy because im so used to such a long commute
1505,"<|emo_disgust|> I mean, [NAME] can play for 10 years as a center, and I'm wondering if Bort is as bad at guard as he is at shooting..."
1508,<|emo_disgust|> >I cannot even watch it I feel so disgusting. Well at least the second movie is better. And the ending was a *bit* unexpected.
1509,"<|emo_disgust|> Ouch, I thought I was a bot, didn’t even think about it and was really really offended! Thanks for sharing"
1510,<|emo_disgust|> Lol why would you trust a [NAME] with an autograt against you and your shit?
1511,<|emo_disgust|> If it's true I'm deeply insulted that a few top level management have their own pages.
1512,<|emo_disgust|> The saddest thing here is you're right
1513,<|emo_disgust|> So disgusting. Reminds me of old [NAME] videos. Must have been a lot worse than this.
1514,<|emo_disgust|> My brain hurts...
1515,<|emo_disgust|> You know you don't say that if it's true. Your point is you're a horrible person and you should feel terrible about it.
1516,<|emo_disgust|> i could try that but i m just feeling very stressed about it all
1517,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, hate that you have family that goes out of your way for you. Stay strong and know you are loved "
1518,"<|emo_disgust|> The saddest thing is that if he really wanted to he could have easily said ""fuck it"" and walked out."
1519,<|emo_disgust|> You're a horrible human being. I'm so sorry.
1520,<|emo_disgust|> Well then it'd be terrible if that was the case. At least there would be less bullshit. :)
1521,<|emo_disgust|> Damn... that's dirty.
1522,"<|emo_disgust|> Worst case scenario these are probably still illegal, so yea it's pretty much anyone who breaks the law anyway. "
1523,<|emo_disgust|> How did he not know he was in? Did he come out for nothing?
1524,<|emo_disgust|> That was an awful open shot.... but a couple of points..
1525,"<|emo_disgust|> When you're ugly like me I don't care if you're 5'0"" and a shade over twice your own height but fuck you for making light of your physical appearance in any way."
1526,"<|emo_disgust|> What the hell are you talking about? There was a video today of [NAME] getting into a bar, apparently not too many people crowded, but he was there."
1527,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't understand why this isn't painfully obvious but yeah, this is why it's so awful."
1528,<|emo_disgust|> That's one vicious cat
1529,<|emo_disgust|> You should see the trash at the Post Office (Dupont Circle) that has their garbage out there 24/7. It's disgusting.
1530,"<|emo_disgust|> In the comments they said the guy was trying to be funny, it was just kinda weird. "
1532,"<|emo_disgust|> I did not, what the actual fuck?"
1533,"<|emo_disgust|> It is more cringe. People didn't think it was weird to eat human organs, didn't think it was weird to try to get someone to donate their organs, and didn't think it was weird to try to get someone to donate organs to others."
1534,"<|emo_disgust|> She's the one who sucks, I'm just a fan"
1535,<|emo_disgust|> What a shitty list
1536,<|emo_disgust|> Damn what a weird post omg
1537,<|emo_disgust|> Wow they’re shite - disgruntled OCSC fan
1538,<|emo_disgust|> This is an entirely false and offensive stereotype.
1539,<|emo_disgust|> Who is afraid of [NAME]?
1540,<|emo_disgust|> The worst feeling ever
1541,"<|emo_disgust|> What a weird way to express your feelings, I hate it."
1542,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I was about to downvote this. You don't even know how bad I fucked up thinking for one second I was on a mobile website.
1543,"<|emo_disgust|> It's weird but I'm genderqueer myself and have always felt like I was attracted to men, but women just seemed more acceptable."
1544,<|emo_disgust|> My parents are divorced. I don't have any contact with my parents since their divorce.
1545,<|emo_disgust|> This makes me want to die
1546,"<|emo_disgust|> This is a worst-case scenario, by far the ugliest."
1549,<|emo_disgust|> You just made me hate the game in general
1551,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fucking idiot lol
1552,<|emo_disgust|> It was a terrible idea
1554,<|emo_disgust|> This guy has one of the weirdest Redditors:
1555,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing worse than this guy is an actual vegan selling t-shirt.
1556,"<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating! Stuck on the Refreshmentos after eating out, couldn't buy any other food, was really sad."
1558,<|emo_disgust|> He does seem creepy.
1559,<|emo_disgust|> The other night my husband had a nightmare while listening to loud music while driving home and ended up smashing his car into a tree
1560,"<|emo_disgust|> But you're a horrible person, and you are an awful liar as well, for spreading false information."
1561,"<|emo_disgust|> They're a bunch of old-school racists and sexists, you smug little cunt"
1562,<|emo_disgust|> You can see just how disgusted and ashamed [NAME] is to be seen
1563,<|emo_disgust|> My favorite commentator on this game
1565,<|emo_disgust|> I can smell [NAME] in here...
1566,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has been a pleasant surprise
1567,"<|emo_disgust|> That’s weird, I thought I was the only one. Thanks for the help!"
1568,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, look at their business model."
1569,<|emo_disgust|> Just say nah.
1570,<|emo_disgust|> Oh god [NAME] is gross
1571,<|emo_disgust|> This is terrible
1572,"<|emo_disgust|> Man seeing as how I spent a good portion of the weekend alone in Arizona with no kids, it seemed like a pretty nice conclusion to the weekend."
1573,<|emo_disgust|> It sounds spasticated.
1574,<|emo_disgust|> He just lost his best friend...and brother. What a loss.
1575,<|emo_disgust|> You are making me look bad [NAME]
1576,<|emo_disgust|> i remember feeling dissatisfied with how little had been accomplished until last year
1577,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], I fucking hate [NAME]."
1578,"<|emo_disgust|> He has a weird sense of humour where his sense of sarcasm is so gross and off, it’s almost disturbing. "
1579,<|emo_disgust|> I have to say I am really happy for you that you are out of your system and not just trying to shut your mouth. You are awesome.
1580,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has gotta suck it
1581,<|emo_disgust|> What the heck?!?!
1582,<|emo_disgust|> There's too many bad options for that to be fair.
1583,<|emo_disgust|> Just admit it. Let the world know you are a horrible and repentant person and focus on what is good in your life instead of your hateful and destructive ways.
1584,<|emo_disgust|> It is a cruel thing to say to someone who is sick.
1585,<|emo_disgust|> This person is a disgusting meme that should cause absolute shit.
1586,<|emo_disgust|> You're weird
1587,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds terrible. Good to know you're alright. Stay strong
1588,"<|emo_disgust|> The thing is, she also said that this is terrible advice. Like, how does it work if she also said that it's terrible advice? "
1589,<|emo_disgust|> The worst part is you can get a job from a respected company and still complain the whole company sucks.
1590,<|emo_disgust|> What a bizarre post omg
1591,<|emo_disgust|> This is amazing
1592,<|emo_disgust|> The amount of trash [NAME] gets thrown in his face is jaw dropping.
1594,"<|emo_disgust|> And I’m not talking about the media, and I hate that I listen to it"
1595,<|emo_disgust|> Damn!
1596,<|emo_disgust|> That seems awful. I'm glad you're all right.
1597,<|emo_disgust|> That is the most disheartening thing I ever heard someone say.
1598,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I didn't know you were a [RELIGION] extremist"" [NAME] is a hate group."
1599,"<|emo_disgust|> Who’s the worst thing that could possibly go wrong for [NAME] with his new deal? Really not a lot, honestly."
1600,<|emo_disgust|> You are a horrible human being.
1601,<|emo_disgust|> How about [NAME] as the Black Queen? I love that idea - the Black Queen would be incredible.
1602,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not sure what this sub is but these are extremely disgusted with [NAME]
1603,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, is it the other way around? You give him a bad rating and he changes it back?"
1604,<|emo_disgust|> So far I've heard bad things about her. Might be worth a try if you're not into [NAME] or [NAME]
1605,<|emo_disgust|> i feel stressed
1606,"<|emo_disgust|> But I don't, I love my husband."
1608,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst thing I've ever seen. Take my upvote if you dare.
1609,<|emo_disgust|> Oh wow I needed to hear this. Thanks for the update boys. I'll let you know if anything changes.
1610,<|emo_disgust|> That may be the worst possible outcome
1611,<|emo_disgust|> I would just be a asshole to people who are going through similar stuff.
1613,"<|emo_disgust|> You don't have to go 6 inches in the draft, but I wouldn't be surprised if he's closer to 6.25 than 6.25."
1616,<|emo_disgust|> Lol I’d be surprised if he did since Canada is very open to immigrants.
1617,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn it, I read the same thing in The Guardian and though it's rubbish I thought it was news"
1618,<|emo_disgust|> i could understand and i could feel i saw all of the anger and hurt this person was feeling but i don t think that person really understood how hurtful some of the things ive said and done have made me and my family members feel
1619,<|emo_disgust|> The irony that it's [NAME] who wants to send you back to your hut you fucking shill
1620,<|emo_disgust|> That would be abuse.
1621,<|emo_disgust|> Weird game I don’t like that you can pick up trash and throw it away
1622,<|emo_disgust|> This post fucking sucks because it doesn't cater to my beliefs.
1623,<|emo_disgust|> This is awful. But it’s [NAME].
1624,<|emo_disgust|> I do hate the way he speaks during those heated moments.
1625,<|emo_disgust|> Omg are you fcking serious sis
1626,<|emo_disgust|> Because [NAME] sucks
1627,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a greedy bastard.
1628,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck off man you are the worst http:
1629,<|emo_disgust|> He never should have done that he’s such a good shooter.
1630,<|emo_disgust|> This is so disgusting. Im disgusted that so many in our society still fall for these ads.
1631,<|emo_disgust|> What a useless tool.
1632,"<|emo_disgust|> It's a bit weird to call your own twin a bimbo, don't you think? But hey, it's a bimbo!"
1633,<|emo_disgust|> Well...the media is hella confusing lately
1634,<|emo_disgust|> It still seems dangerous
1635,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing that can happen is an ex partner cheating on you
1636,<|emo_disgust|> The most hateful thing he said was this
1637,<|emo_disgust|> I want to be a mommy so bad but my schedule is sofull
1640,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah it's weird to see someone's dog walking around with a covered diaper and fur on at the same time
1641,<|emo_disgust|> This is horrible news. I'm in Canada writing this. I hope they get [NAME] or [NAME] to come back here somehow. I have a big family and I'd really like to see them come back
1642,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was awful last year. I'm really expecting him to turn it up this year.
1643,<|emo_disgust|> It’s a terrible sign to see lol
1644,<|emo_disgust|> I mean the whole idea behind it is crazy but y'all I'm listening to old dudes
1645,<|emo_disgust|> It’s about damn 16 hours late^^. Sucks that I can’t do anything about it until tomorrow.
1646,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that we still have [NAME] on our team right now despite all of this is infuriating.
1648,<|emo_disgust|> But I'm happy for you both! #workonitforward
1649,<|emo_disgust|> No. They look sick!
1650,"<|emo_disgust|> She's not the most beautiful alive person, but she makes me feel more empathetic towards women."
1651,<|emo_disgust|> You’re an unwelcome presence at the college campus
1652,<|emo_disgust|> i should stop being so gloomy but i feel stressed out just thinking about it
1653,<|emo_disgust|> So much fake news.
1654,<|emo_disgust|> And that hat? WHAT? Fuck it.
1655,<|emo_disgust|> That’s terrible. I really hope you’re okay.
1656,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, you're horrible"
1657,"<|emo_disgust|> The way I see it is they are just bad people, who are mad because a small group of bad apples did something awful."
1658,<|emo_disgust|> The fact you've named your new dogafter [NAME] makes me pissed. Good work!
1660,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] fuckin sucks
1661,<|emo_disgust|> That hair looks way longer than her butt.
1662,<|emo_disgust|> I know a guy named [NAME] who is exactly the same. He’s horrible
1663,<|emo_disgust|> It’s so disgusting how everyday you’re gonna hear something [ugly]
1664,<|emo_disgust|> Why do you hate [NAME] so much? He seemed like such a sweet boy
1665,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is such a fucking asshole tbh with all that gold jewellery
1667,<|emo_disgust|> He was literally a psychopath.
1668,<|emo_disgust|> That's what the real racist said. Get out now.
1669,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn it, why do these dumbasses care about anything but their own self-esteem?"
1672,"<|emo_disgust|> They don't even use the word ""frick"" as a swear word!"
1673,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn that's dirty
1674,<|emo_disgust|> That's one vicious cat.
1675,<|emo_disgust|> They're disgusting.
1676,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah damn, don't have kids yet. "
1677,<|emo_disgust|> So [NAME] is probably as dumb as everyone else charged with her murder. I’m just waiting until she’s tried for hire to ask what’s for.
1678,<|emo_disgust|> I'm a 35 year old man. I just don't know how to deal with this. I hate myself.
1679,<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting. Apt.
1680,<|emo_disgust|> >I honestly feel that they aren't being punished enough for their crimes. Well done yourself. Pretty mean tbh <3
1681,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a weirdo.
1682,<|emo_disgust|> I hate people like this.
1683,<|emo_disgust|> Just so weirded out that I actually thought it was a guy.
1684,<|emo_disgust|> > There's a reason I said I didn't care and I'm just being a doofus.
1685,<|emo_disgust|> The guy is very socially awkward.
1686,<|emo_disgust|> Why so hateful.
1687,<|emo_disgust|> So many fucking fake news stories per day. Fucking ruinous.
1688,<|emo_disgust|> I hate all of politics because it's one P5 plus one NED/ICS combined. Not a fair/impartial account.
1689,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you?
1690,<|emo_disgust|> Well done lol. No wonder I’m friends with people like you since I went on my first meet up.
1691,<|emo_disgust|> If I didn’t like my dad I’d probably never date him.
1692,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck the rangers
1693,<|emo_disgust|> And now you're saying it's a bad thing. Stop trying to cohere into a coherent argument.
1694,<|emo_disgust|> i can see the tears of the woman who was so appalled by that i feel that it s just so wrong
1695,"<|emo_disgust|> How the hell is that comment ""holding the GM accountable"" if not to blame them for using poor tactics and drafting sub-par players"
1696,"<|emo_disgust|> It can't be, I’m at work right now and it’s been like 4 hours"
1697,<|emo_disgust|> They’re disgusting people inside and out
1698,<|emo_disgust|> i did not say that they have to pay for a break. i said they could use some positive encouragement for it on their own.
1699,<|emo_disgust|> What a weird way to ask a question about religion
1700,<|emo_disgust|> I'm going to be honest with you. A large majority of us don't actually care if some of the people who care do.
1703,"<|emo_disgust|> No, you're a cunt"
1706,<|emo_disgust|> Well yeah its weird
1707,<|emo_disgust|> This is very telling of how the left are playing these games. They are using you as a tool to further their goals.
1708,<|emo_disgust|> This has to be a joke. They are so far and crazy. Someone gettting this far fetched
1709,<|emo_disgust|> The “nasty kitty” poster. That poor kitty.
1710,<|emo_disgust|> That’s awful. :(
1711,<|emo_disgust|> But how dare [NAME] apologise to her British subjects for helping protect them! [NAME] Britain’s protectors deserve better!
1712,<|emo_disgust|> The worst comes from the people who think this way and then do the thing that really makes them hate the person.
1713,<|emo_disgust|> i can remember him feeling incredibly dissatisfied and hurt
1714,<|emo_disgust|> It took a lot longer than expected for you to get a real job so it's kinda a miracle
1715,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has one really weird move when he whacks a guy with a car, and it looks so horrifying."
1716,<|emo_disgust|> That is incredibly creepy.
1717,<|emo_disgust|> This is really creepy
1718,"<|emo_disgust|> The worst was just the intro, what with the guitars, and the weird lyrics"
1719,<|emo_disgust|> They're all the worst.
1720,<|emo_disgust|> I’ve never been in the military so I can’t say. But that’s nothing compared to being sick or injured and need that medical care.
1721,<|emo_disgust|> You’re disgusting
1722,<|emo_disgust|> Lol okay so I’m confused
1723,<|emo_disgust|> My favourite bloke has said some disgusting things but the one thing he has actually said is pretty eyebrow- raising.
1724,<|emo_disgust|> That last night was worse than the first two. The cast and even the theme were great tho
1725,<|emo_disgust|> i dont understand the blame game and i feel so envious and jealous
1726,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you *castrate* [NAME]! /s
1727,<|emo_disgust|> Who cares? He's still a hypocrite.
1728,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that his wife is his opposite number on his dating app is just weird.
1729,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like im the one annoying someones
1730,<|emo_disgust|> What doesAbusive_Punishment_is?
1731,<|emo_disgust|> I know a couple of people who are. They've had it for years now.
1732,<|emo_disgust|> This is so creepy. Good riddance to awful rubbish.
1733,<|emo_disgust|> It's racist
1735,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you talk to [NAME] about your problems! He works for the government! their [NAME]!
1736,"<|emo_disgust|> Now I'm crying in your Reddit because I already used the same word for you. Ohhhhhh, no wonder I'm so angry."
1737,<|emo_disgust|> She's a terrible host.
1738,<|emo_disgust|> This is ugly af sry
1739,<|emo_disgust|> I want to say [NAME] but the writing just doesn't translate
1740,"<|emo_disgust|> No, what you're trying to say is that because the people in government are far worse than the ones in politics, you can't bring a gun to a meeting without being shot?! Nooo!"
1741,<|emo_disgust|> That shit sent me on a fucking journey to read
1742,<|emo_disgust|> She doesn't have the right combination of looks and demeanour to be a model. I'd hate her.
1743,<|emo_disgust|> Worst nightmare
1745,<|emo_disgust|> What is this fucking r/niceguys bullshit. Please elaborate.
1746,<|emo_disgust|> Because they want to make their own profit. Stop giving them free meals and free health plans.
1747,"<|emo_disgust|> No deal, abort, abort. abort, abort. abort!!"
1748,"<|emo_disgust|> The top comment says ""I'm not fucking showering in your sink""."
1749,<|emo_disgust|> That’s a horrifying amount of bp for such a terrible troll. What does that say about his character?
1750,<|emo_disgust|> It's creepy that he does this.
1751,<|emo_disgust|> Holy crap I've been waiting for this
1753,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird idea, but ok"
1754,<|emo_disgust|> This one is my absolute favorite.
1755,<|emo_disgust|> i have a feeling im going to get really grumpy about this all day
1756,<|emo_disgust|> So many people assume that since we have 4 teams in the NFC E since 2000 we'd be able to make another Super Bowl. That ain't fucking true lol.
1757,"<|emo_disgust|> The ""right to bear arms for self-defense"" is a lie and anyone who speaks of it is a bad defender of rights. The same with abortion."
1758,<|emo_disgust|> This man should go to HELL
1759,<|emo_disgust|> I want to see the front door before I go in.
1760,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I never listen to much prog or hardcore, but I love metal as well if that helps."
1761,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, they are still guilty of terrible things, but at least they had the where with their cars "
1762,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you. You brought a gun to a gun fight. Leave your gun in the middle of the intersection though.
1764,<|emo_disgust|> Not really cringe. Just sad.
1765,<|emo_disgust|> It’s called harassment. It’s bad.
1766,<|emo_disgust|> Lol yeah well it’s a weird thing people do
1767,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] and [NAME] the asshole
1768,"<|emo_disgust|> No, it's not. So what you're saying is you don't know what ""sexual harassment"" is?"
1769,<|emo_disgust|> The only problem I had with it was that the facehuggers couldn't see you through the pupils!
1771,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not giving a damn about the r/television news article either. They're probably worse than you.
1774,<|emo_disgust|> The problem is that the other option is just killing them and giving them all the food and stuff
1775,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] and [NAME] are horrible. Just awful.
1777,<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting. The only good thing about a BSE is that it's rare.
1778,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I’m leaving Reddit.
1779,"<|emo_disgust|> People always seem to say something which means little to me. Like ""what a waste of packaging"""
1780,<|emo_disgust|> But I hate [NAME]
1781,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, your self-identification is so important - thanks a lot. "
1782,<|emo_disgust|> And there I was blaming poor black lads
1783,<|emo_disgust|> This is worse than the [NAME] post. Just imagine if this was a real post. is fucking up [NAME] post style < img src http : / / blog / href http : / bry
1785,<|emo_disgust|> That’s a horrible thing to say. Lucky he didn’t yell something racist.
1786,"<|emo_disgust|> A guy that big can get a girl's jersey ripped off and thrown away like trash, look at that shit!"
1789,"<|emo_disgust|> No one gives a fuck about your ""right"" to kill the poor animals at your home, then...huh?"
1790,<|emo_disgust|> There is nothing wrong with having a background check. But the problem is that you're a crazyo.
1791,<|emo_disgust|> She's still a horrible president.
1793,<|emo_disgust|> Oh no that's horrible
1794,<|emo_disgust|> That was dirty.
1795,<|emo_disgust|> i could never have hated or begrudged anyone who watched i felt like im one of those who were only bothered by what other people were saying without feeling completely offended
1796,<|emo_disgust|> How dare people have fun in this hell
1797,<|emo_disgust|> That looks like total garbage.
1798,<|emo_disgust|> i didnt feel too agitated
1799,<|emo_disgust|> Shut your stupid mouth you shill /s
1801,<|emo_disgust|> You better be!!
1802,"<|emo_disgust|> Not sure, I might be more of a rational person, but I feel like a lunatic "
1804,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I don't think that's gonna happen but I'm very pleased how much I like him now
1805,"<|emo_disgust|> This is not a game, you're a disgusting scum bag."
1806,<|emo_disgust|> The new season of t@gged is truly an embarrassment to Netflix.
1807,<|emo_disgust|> This is super creepy and pretty sad. Eleven yearolds probably feel this way.
1808,"<|emo_disgust|> I just hate the ""I don't know"" people (that's you, not me) so much."
1809,<|emo_disgust|> How dare they not have the foresight to realize how much smarter people have been for so long...this is absolutely disgusting.
1810,<|emo_disgust|> I hate everything about this
1811,<|emo_disgust|> I think the only bad thing that could possibly come from this is people following her around looking for revenge.
1812,<|emo_disgust|> The only reason [NAME] is still a [NAME] is because we hated throwing him the ball as much as we did [NAME].
1813,<|emo_disgust|> It's a prime-time soap. [NAME] makes it less cringe-worthy than [NAME] and [NAME].
1814,<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry that your manager treats you so poorly. Well done!
1815,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like a cold is in order
1816,<|emo_disgust|> He must really hate people because he calls them [NAME] all the time.
1818,<|emo_disgust|> Don’t forget that ‘15’s still the law if a 16 was caught with an oz of weed and shot by a jealous man.
1819,<|emo_disgust|> How is your relationship with your boyfriend not shitty? I think it's fucked up because he repeatedly implies his sexual attraction to other women while you are completely devoted to him.
1820,<|emo_disgust|> Well the other options are worse :(
1821,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm a woman, 40, and I honestly don't know what to say to this. I feel you."
1822,<|emo_disgust|> Man I hate that [NAME] guy a lot.
1823,<|emo_disgust|> He was just terrible in Charlotte
1824,"<|emo_disgust|> But this is also the reason why I like games so much, to have that ""aha, fuck it"" moment where you realize something screwed up in your game"
1825,<|emo_disgust|> But it’d look so bad!?!?!?
1827,"<|emo_disgust|> It's a weird thing to be ashamed of, though."
1828,"<|emo_disgust|> If you just eat whatever comes out of your vagina, you are disgusting. "
1829,<|emo_disgust|> It's not fair to expect him to play every game after suffering a season ending injury
1831,<|emo_disgust|> I feel like crying
1832,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, [NAME]. Now *I’M* angry"
1834,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking idiotic thing to say.
1835,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking hate [NAME]...he is a living legend in this game
1836,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is fucking destroying Bama and I LOVE IT
1837,<|emo_disgust|> Holy fuck this sub 🤣 🤣🤣
1838,<|emo_disgust|> Wow you’re a horrible human being
1839,<|emo_disgust|> i feel rather sarcastic
1840,<|emo_disgust|> I'm gonna die.
1841,"<|emo_disgust|> I’m with you, her hair is awful."
1842,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] a bit of a bastard tbh with his daughters birthday party.
1843,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn I’d love to have a text that read “Hey justin, what's up”"
1845,<|emo_disgust|> It kinda sucks but I'm happy for you.
1846,"<|emo_disgust|> This isn't just a Twitter account. This is a real person, and she's an awful bad AND irreligious person. You've missed everything."
1847,<|emo_disgust|> The most awful thing I've seen up there.
1848,<|emo_disgust|> How disgusting!
1850,<|emo_disgust|> How come you think it won't kill you. /s
1851,<|emo_disgust|> Because there’s nothing funny about being ugly
1852,"<|emo_disgust|> I'll be surprised if he doesn't get into a few more shit-tier fights with [NAME] at some point, so watch out"
1853,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, yeah? "
1854,<|emo_disgust|> And that suit is awful
1855,<|emo_disgust|> Wow that was an awful open shot....
1858,<|emo_disgust|> No offense taken but your parents are assholes.
1859,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck. That.
1860,<|emo_disgust|> We need to find a way to not accept that [NAME] can’t play
1861,<|emo_disgust|> Oof lmao sorry buddy
1862,<|emo_disgust|> This is an exact mirror image to Reddit culture. It's just disgusting.
1863,<|emo_disgust|> This is so disgusting! Where did you get it? Are there any laws against this?
1864,"<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest thing that happened was that the pills she took actually weren’t pills, they were amphetamine pills."
1865,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit it actually did...
1866,<|emo_disgust|> I would rather have [NAME] go 15-0 with a sub 30 win season than 6 years from now let him sit out.
1867,<|emo_disgust|> The only acceptable form of expression in that case is to brandish a gun.
1869,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a worse All Star than [NAME]. Just horrible
1870,<|emo_disgust|> I don't like the “Bassetoot” and “Horseoots” thrown in as well but these songs aren’t bad overall. That’s my biggest complaint.
1871,<|emo_disgust|> It's also a weird thing to say to a man.
1872,<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry you felt that way.
1874,"<|emo_disgust|> The lack of any consistency in the supporting cast is astounding. Like, you never see any [NAME] at the start, and then [NAME] are everywhere. "
1875,<|emo_disgust|> Because it's creepy.
1876,<|emo_disgust|> This is worse than the [NAME] video
1878,<|emo_disgust|> The saddest thing is that the man is trying to live by the Love first motto of'Giving as you give'
1881,<|emo_disgust|> Because the false accusation makes my anxiety worse
1882,<|emo_disgust|> You can't see it from here if you're not a horse
1884,"<|emo_disgust|> People don't look at the issues with a critical eye and think ""well it's not that bad at all."""
1885,<|emo_disgust|> There [NAME] is a special place in Hell for these people.
1887,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit i thought I was the only one who thought of that lol.
1888,<|emo_disgust|> Weird how he looks like he got impregnated by a bear
1889,<|emo_disgust|> i could feel myself getting quite hot from all the people around
1890,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing that makes the fan base cringe is how much they hate him on here.
1891,<|emo_disgust|> This is the saddest thing I've seen on here yesterday.
1892,"<|emo_disgust|> We're still a few years away from a fixed term school, if you want a long term career. Stay tuned"
1893,"<|emo_disgust|> Your friends, family, etc are being disgusting."
1894,<|emo_disgust|> Oh my [NAME]...
1895,<|emo_disgust|> That's a nice dress by [NAME].
1896,<|emo_disgust|> Damn. Just Damn.
1897,<|emo_disgust|> What a sad and angry thread you've coiled up
1898,<|emo_disgust|> Oh god another injury
1899,<|emo_disgust|> This is nasty NSFW
1900,<|emo_disgust|> He is stupid and childish and not grown up.
1901,<|emo_disgust|> Who would have thought we were going to back a guy and then sign this kid as our OC the moment he came in.
1902,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that’s not even funny. You’re overreacting dude.
1903,"<|emo_disgust|> No, because you didn't actually do anything interesting in the game. That's just dumb."
1904,<|emo_disgust|> Damn who did this to me
1905,<|emo_disgust|> How are they not? They're so damn adorable!
1906,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is really just a cashier at a drive through. I don’t give shit about his morals, religion, etc."
1907,<|emo_disgust|> Weird how the top image has her hair in a updoot and the background is mostly of washed out beach
1908,<|emo_disgust|> Don't do stupid stuff
1910,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, I haven’t read the book but I have the weirdest memory for this one."
1914,"<|emo_disgust|> I would say this. Stay in your car. If it hadn't been for [NAME] pulling you over, you would have gotten away with not even getting off."
1915,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn I'll be at the games, just act like I'm not. "
1916,<|emo_disgust|> i have to admit i can feel quite envious as i walk past young women in their clothes in the street
1917,<|emo_disgust|> Wow a guy went to 10 steps in a matter of minutes and then blamed his lack of experience for the problem.
1919,<|emo_disgust|> The reason I have a job is I love my job.
1920,<|emo_disgust|> That is so disgusting. Im disgusted that some parents would force their kids to bully other kids.
1921,<|emo_disgust|> I've played test mode multiple times and gotten progressively worse. I hate being that guy....
1922,<|emo_disgust|> But i feel slightly guilty for not knowing any English back then (not knowing anything for a long time).
1923,<|emo_disgust|> She's not going to the prom either.
1924,"<|emo_disgust|> That's a weird way to spell ""son of a bitch."""
1925,<|emo_disgust|> The real reason people hate On The Road is because they are the direct opposite of whatoberonians are. Totally realize it’s a horrible thing to say.
1926,"<|emo_disgust|> No, they will resent it as abuse. "
1927,<|emo_disgust|> If it’s done horribly I’d drop it without writing a word. But I’m done right now
1928,<|emo_disgust|> i feel extremely petty for being here
1929,<|emo_disgust|> Shut up nerd
1930,<|emo_disgust|> This is so creepy and sweet and it makes me want to stop eating ants.
1931,<|emo_disgust|> I’ve been waiting 2 years for this! Now I’m impatient and looking for the same thing
1932,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a scumbag and a liar. [NAME] has supported her since the age of 15 even though it’s years since she’s been in public.
1933,"<|emo_disgust|> That’s the only damn thing she’s mad about, is all."
1934,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn. I just got my dreads on for shit, and now my arms are hairier than the rest of my body."
1936,<|emo_disgust|> That’s awful🤔
1937,<|emo_disgust|> This has to be so creepy.
1938,<|emo_disgust|> Well damn I am sad that I gave a shitvote to a shitpost directed towards me
1939,<|emo_disgust|> I know I’m late but I hate [NAME] so much
1940,<|emo_disgust|> The reason I say they're garbage is because I actually like 'em.
1941,<|emo_disgust|> That was your saddest shortest story yet
1942,<|emo_disgust|> Oh shitttt. I cant imagine how hard it is to look at a penis bigger than your own and be disgusted
1943,<|emo_disgust|> i feel that the main reason people have negative opinions about me is because i am not honest and truthful
1944,<|emo_disgust|> Who cares? I can’t get into any of them despite this.
1946,<|emo_disgust|> There is a special place in hell for these people
1947,"<|emo_disgust|> The fact that you're a liberal proves you're uneducated /r/nyheteroromouslyformedatheists, your lack of common sense is even worse."
1950,"<|emo_disgust|> In the US? Not surprising since it's the most expensive country in the developed world. At $11,000 a month, that's a hell of a life."
1951,<|emo_disgust|> He's just going to keep getting into trouble
1952,<|emo_disgust|> That's so weird. I always thought they were just crazy people.
1953,"<|emo_disgust|> That's so disgusting. And yes, he absolutely has."
1954,"<|emo_disgust|> I mean, yes, sexist Bigotry is bad and all, but do you really want to call women who wear short dresses ""SJW's""?"
1955,<|emo_disgust|> Because it's a dumb and terrible idea.
1956,<|emo_disgust|> She's obviously awful.
1957,<|emo_disgust|> I've got this shirt I could wear just about anywhere lol
1958,<|emo_disgust|> It’s all very well said but what if the victim is a cop? Can't really believe that this is the only thing that gets them off.
1960,"<|emo_disgust|> There is an actual subreddit for cheating, not just nostalgic shitposts."
1961,<|emo_disgust|> So you'd rather be disgusting than admit to being a sexual impostor.
1962,"<|emo_disgust|> Who fucking cares? His videos are dead, end him."
1963,<|emo_disgust|> So creepy and making it look like a joke. Even more disgusting.
1964,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] fuck those creeps
1965,<|emo_disgust|> This is creepy and weird. Thanks for sharing. Do you have a link or video of the Source?
1966,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is when you get a text with pics in it and no reply. Very creepy.
1967,"<|emo_disgust|> This is what I call the ""SJWification"" of Reddit. The lefties are the worst as a group."
1969,<|emo_disgust|> He will not let me hug him. He'll just slap me.
1970,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I like [NAME]... but I have no idea why she's in this relationship while [NAME] is in the opposite
1971,"<|emo_disgust|> It’s a bit strange to be using a personal mobile network like that at work, unless it’s a Google Plus or similar plan"
1972,<|emo_disgust|> Aaand I hate it too...
1973,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Why everyone hurts me?"""
1974,<|emo_disgust|> Well I guess I am stupid
1975,<|emo_disgust|> The fuck we doing on our sub this week?
1976,<|emo_disgust|> And it sucks to feel that way.
1977,<|emo_disgust|> Worst that can happen is he trips under the truck and the other guy is injured
1978,<|emo_disgust|> And then it stops. It never gets to that point because the idiots with shitty companies and bad public opinion use some bullshit arguing that it's not their fault.
1979,"<|emo_disgust|> That woman also used the same fake Twitter handle, @_shannon_pool."
1980,<|emo_disgust|> He’s just jealous of [NAME] with Lille. Jokes aside this guy is an awful wat wat wat
1982,<|emo_disgust|> And the saddest part is that most were either college students or just passing through the airport
1983,<|emo_disgust|> This really needs to be banned
1984,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck Yeah!
1985,<|emo_disgust|> That’s so disgusting. Truly disgusting. VWP
1986,<|emo_disgust|> People are disgusting and insane.
1987,<|emo_disgust|> There’s a difference between liking someone’s opinions and being racist.
1988,<|emo_disgust|> I didn't get it [NAME]. Why are my posts downvoted? I need to comment!
1989,<|emo_disgust|> Those people think that they're better than the worst. They think they can make a profit on their immoral behavior.
1990,<|emo_disgust|> No deal. Not interested.
1991,<|emo_disgust|> She's a pro-Assad piece of shit.
1992,<|emo_disgust|> You probably can't do that if your pregnant. Even worse if your eating all sorts of weird shit you never thought of.
1993,<|emo_disgust|> She sounds hideous.
1995,<|emo_disgust|> i still feel like i cant stand up for what im feeling
1996,<|emo_disgust|> How I've been avoiding these since. But damn am I glad I made the move this time. We needed this.
1998,<|emo_disgust|> But it’s more of a problem with the women?
1999,<|emo_disgust|> He can't do that. He's too fat.
2001,<|emo_disgust|> I wonder why the fuckers aren’t clapping
2002,"<|emo_disgust|> What a complete and utter cunt, I find it extremely hard to watch."
2003,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like im a hateful ugly fat ugly ugly ugly weirdo
2004,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing this movie does that didn’t make me cringe in real life is slap [NAME] face.
2006,<|emo_disgust|> >[NAME] is a fucking monster! An actual monster!
2007,"<|emo_disgust|> I hate the ""I don't know"" people... Just because someone answers the door doesnt mean they know what happened."
2008,"<|emo_disgust|> That is so disgusting. Im disgusted that anyone would dignify that by saying 'okay, pretty OK'"
2009,<|emo_disgust|> Why are you so angry? I've never seen this before.
2010,<|emo_disgust|> I really hate that I like them
2011,<|emo_disgust|> But the real worst is when the only tool they have is a gun to your head
2013,<|emo_disgust|> So you are an awful human being.
2014,"<|emo_disgust|> And if that isn't bad enough, see these two:"
2015,<|emo_disgust|> This is just so infuriating.
2016,<|emo_disgust|> And to think I'd never even thought to check. Lol
2017,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit right there
2018,<|emo_disgust|> What a bummer. It really is an embarrassment to Canada.
2019,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds disgusting. I'd wash my mouth out.
2021,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you. I have proof all the while saying you’re a racist. How dare you.
2022,"<|emo_disgust|> So much wasted time and effort, an absolute disgrace."
2023,<|emo_disgust|> People were mad that [NAME] had not thrown in the towel and backed off of his offer on a 3 year contract
2024,<|emo_disgust|> I mean I can see how he feels. I'm disgusted that he would defend this.
2025,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is worst general manageraider I've ever seen
2026,<|emo_disgust|> This is actually fascinating. Is this the beginning of some kind of horrifying future?
2027,<|emo_disgust|> I just want to die
2028,<|emo_disgust|> I still don't believe he's a closeted racist.
2029,"<|emo_disgust|> I think it better goes like this ""Hey now this is how it's done"" I'm just being dramatic."
2031,<|emo_disgust|> I don’t know you but I fucking love your voice.
2032,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] you missed the chance to say racist stuff against [NAME]
2033,<|emo_disgust|> There is a reason I was kicked off. It seems to be a top priority for the [NAME] in office.
2034,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so distracted at work
2035,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] [NAME]
2036,<|emo_disgust|> This sounds way worse than it actually is tbh [NAME] is on fire and he isn't gonna let this go
2037,<|emo_disgust|> This is worse than a horror comic
2038,<|emo_disgust|> Thats absolutely disgusting. Im disgusted that one of your Facebook friends encouraged that.
2039,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah he’s a drunk and a little bit of a talker. You’re just fine.
2040,<|emo_disgust|> Well fuck you.
2042,<|emo_disgust|> Don’t use [NAME] as an excuse. He’s a horrible player who doesn’t deserve your Time.
2043,<|emo_disgust|> The first and only time someone asked to meet the lord was when i left for St. Louis for the first time in January of 1992.
2044,"<|emo_disgust|> It's horrible, I love watching it."
2045,<|emo_disgust|> What a bummer. The good kind.
2046,<|emo_disgust|> What a disgusting list
2047,<|emo_disgust|> There is absolutely zero chance that that scenario came to mind! You took your word for it!
2048,<|emo_disgust|> i could feel myself getting pissed off after i walked by that sign
2049,"<|emo_disgust|> In your case, its the fault of the system, and the system is fucked."
2050,<|emo_disgust|> Because it’s a stupid question with no answer? Stop trolling.
2051,<|emo_disgust|> I can smell the snot oozing out of the old man's asshole already
2052,<|emo_disgust|> You need to get out of bed and come clean about it. That's how your relationship with [NAME] ended.
2053,<|emo_disgust|> I hated that smug ass lawyer.
2054,<|emo_disgust|> This is an ad hominem attack. Your whole argument is based on attack rather than an argument.
2055,<|emo_disgust|> i feel rude saying that
2057,<|emo_disgust|> The thing to realize is that everyone is always being lied to and abused. This is a perfect example.
2058,<|emo_disgust|> The only good thing about the meme is the face
2059,<|emo_disgust|> That is so disgusting. The disgusting thing is she hasn't even done anything wrong.
2061,<|emo_disgust|> He's a moron
2062,<|emo_disgust|> >it seems like he was born an awful person. He was also very good at pretending to be awful. How does the fake being fake fail?
2063,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, that's pretty much what people who get posts on r/postgres are, by the way."
2064,<|emo_disgust|> I really miss [NAME]. A lot.
2066,<|emo_disgust|> What a weird man
2067,<|emo_disgust|> I didn't know we had a board. I was surprised it wasn't already on there. Lmao
2068,"<|emo_disgust|> So pathetic. A real man would have said that. He might have been right. A lot of insecure, horny men are like that."
2069,"<|emo_disgust|> That's true, and that was a horrendous pass if it hit heere. It's kind of like a bad refs call."
2070,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn it, sometimes I really can't tell if the dude I'm talking to is sarcastic or serious. "
2071,"<|emo_disgust|> I think he's a glutton for punishment, and is a little too fond of himself"
2073,<|emo_disgust|> What a disgusting woman.
2074,<|emo_disgust|> My parents died. What a RIP.
2075,<|emo_disgust|> When I was a kid it was worse. I still get emotional watching this right now.
2076,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] in the Lego movie? You've never seen a red headed step child.
2078,"<|emo_disgust|> The fact that she didn’t get a job is what sucks, maybe more than the fact she isn’t 40."
2079,<|emo_disgust|> It’s disgusting.
2080,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, my [NAME], what a horrible person "
2081,"<|emo_disgust|> I’m being really mean here, but your parents died... :("
2082,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck this guy for telling you he likes going out in treacherous weather.
2083,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, the people that are posting these are either very dumb, or very malicious."
2084,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, it's not. This sort of thing is stupid when it's happened to you. I guess being in your mid 40's is more towards the problem. "
2085,<|emo_disgust|> Well no. Some people have nothing left to lose so they are literally willing to take any form of abuse. It’s sick.
2086,<|emo_disgust|> I am crying.
2087,"<|emo_disgust|> There are people there that read that and think ""it's all a joke"" and pretend it's not because of the name that this sub has."
2088,<|emo_disgust|> Well that sucks and I’m sorry for your loss. What can you do to help her out? It really sucks you can’t help her
2089,"<|emo_disgust|> That's what I said, I can't believe people actually follow those lines."
2090,<|emo_disgust|> The only negative I have is it was a short video and there could be a lot more to come. Cheers!
2091,<|emo_disgust|> Shut up cowpoke
2092,<|emo_disgust|> This. It's the worst.
2093,<|emo_disgust|> The fact you don't actually have a working internet connection is a real red flag.
2094,<|emo_disgust|> I’m jealous.
2095,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is really bad at football and should not be general manager.
2096,"<|emo_disgust|> In case any remainers fall sick, there will be a lot of acrimony and discontent."
2097,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] it’s actually pretty cringe
2098,<|emo_disgust|> Well I went to the movies that are really bad but I will enjoy them anyway. Just not the movies with terrible acting.
2099,<|emo_disgust|> Worst phone sex I've ever had.
2100,<|emo_disgust|> It kind of sucks that the only thing I have in common with him is a weird obsession with his own appearance
2101,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is always the dirtiest psychopath
2102,<|emo_disgust|> It is actually much worse that people think it's just US trade. As someone who wants to leave the country but also is afraid the US would let me in:
2103,"<|emo_disgust|> Those women are the worst, ugh."
2104,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Haha look at that ass, sassy little boi."""
2106,<|emo_disgust|> You should've told her [NAME] was coming. I honestly never realized that was a thing. :(
2107,<|emo_disgust|> No wonder it's disgusting!
2109,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] should have headed back to Derry instead of going to Limerick for some training.
2110,<|emo_disgust|> That was the worst save I've ever seen [NAME] make. Well done.
2111,<|emo_disgust|> That’s ridiculous. I’m so sorry this happened to you friend. :(
2112,"<|emo_disgust|> I’m with you, [NAME] has been bad on the road lately"
2113,<|emo_disgust|> Wow. You are quite clear on your goals. Now go out there and fulfill them.
2115,<|emo_disgust|> If [NAME] is on pace for 70 goals this season.... what the hell
2116,"<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. But it's also a good thing, to draw attention to the neglect of these issues by large western media!"
2117,<|emo_disgust|> That's a terrible list
2118,<|emo_disgust|> Wow what a fuckin n
2119,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst take I've ever heard on cooking ever.
2120,<|emo_disgust|> It’s so fucking creepy
2121,<|emo_disgust|> This thread is rage-inducing
2123,<|emo_disgust|> It's disgusting how many fake news outfits have influence in the Swedish media though.
2124,<|emo_disgust|> This shit is so infuriating.
2125,<|emo_disgust|> She is a piece of shit.
2126,<|emo_disgust|> You said you were in denial >_<
2127,<|emo_disgust|> Don't call this baby a jerk It just loves its humans too much
2128,<|emo_disgust|> He has more makeup than [NAME]
2129,<|emo_disgust|> Oh my god.
2131,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh wow, that was deep. I hope you make out well move on and find true love."
2133,<|emo_disgust|> You've done nothing to deserve the death penalty. Your only crime was to kill a police officer.
2134,<|emo_disgust|> Your friend could die of typhoid if he didn’t condom
2135,<|emo_disgust|> That would be assault and battery.
2137,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] that is so disgusting
2138,<|emo_disgust|> There is a subreddit for cheating. It's disgusting.
2139,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] does what I hate on a daily basis and I'm sitting here saying ""fuck it"""
2140,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is the least interesting
2141,<|emo_disgust|> This is sick
2143,<|emo_disgust|> This is my worst fear
2144,"<|emo_disgust|> It’s not even that generous. I’ll take anyone at 6% income, but a family with two is hard."
2145,<|emo_disgust|> That is awful. I hope your ex isn't heartless and decided to end things without even trying. You two seem very happy together.
2146,<|emo_disgust|> There was a horrible accident
2147,<|emo_disgust|> What is worse is having a perfectly good YouTube channel that's constantly being uploaded to.
2149,<|emo_disgust|> Wow that’s a horrible amount of bp for 3 players
2150,<|emo_disgust|> Not really a shock since he's the guy who started all this.
2151,<|emo_disgust|> That is so frustrating.
2152,<|emo_disgust|> Well that is disgusting.
2153,"<|emo_disgust|> It's a disgusting trend, and it's getting worse."
2154,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird, no tax from them to pay for our schools?"
2155,<|emo_disgust|> Man you're creepy
2156,<|emo_disgust|> i feel pretty spiteful now
2157,<|emo_disgust|> Not good at all
2158,"<|emo_disgust|> And when they get mad at you for wanting to go to parties they don’t celebrate, they're probably a lot worse than their parents are. "
2159,<|emo_disgust|> A man washes his car in the middle of the road without wearing seatbelts to save his life. This is terrible
2160,<|emo_disgust|> What a bummer that [NAME] isn't interested.
2161,<|emo_disgust|> And [NAME] has just done the same exact thing to [NAME]
2162,<|emo_disgust|> Whoops forgot to add the link...
2163,"<|emo_disgust|> He was just a local, nothing to do with anything."
2164,<|emo_disgust|> Damn you.
2166,<|emo_disgust|> i feel hated by the world
2167,<|emo_disgust|> That's quite a lot worse tbh
2168,<|emo_disgust|> My wife and I have similar exact problems. How frustrating.
2169,<|emo_disgust|> i feel very passionate about doing some work on my blog to help people avoid their traps and make the world a better place
2170,<|emo_disgust|> I’m scared for the kids. I don’t want them to go to prom with me
2172,<|emo_disgust|> The weird eyeshadow his eyes are covered in.
2174,<|emo_disgust|> That’s really cringy. It’s so easy to say “I’m not going to worry about it” but *you’re* gonna worry. Fuck off.
2175,<|emo_disgust|> And to think i would be the one who is going to be pissed off when she goes home with a handsome guy.
2176,<|emo_disgust|> There is actually a lot more to religion than this. Are you trying to be religionophobic and ignorant?
2178,<|emo_disgust|> i woke up last friday feeling very distressed and sad
2179,<|emo_disgust|> Because they know the terrorists are already there. So they make people act surprised when they don't see a bomb going off.
2180,<|emo_disgust|> This comment is stupid.
2181,"<|emo_disgust|> A-fucking-men! The sad, pathetic excuse for a man - a pathetic excuse at that"
2182,<|emo_disgust|> I got no money and no goods...
2183,<|emo_disgust|> This is awful
2185,<|emo_disgust|> I didn't know [NAME] or [NAME] were both stars...
2186,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, it's a weird thing people do."
2187,<|emo_disgust|> What a waste of plastic.
2188,<|emo_disgust|> What kind of relationship is that? I'm a horrible romantic but I do have a few.
2190,<|emo_disgust|> If you don’t mind just drop your food in there. Your eating a hell of a mess then.
2191,<|emo_disgust|> Now I feel like crying
2192,<|emo_disgust|> I miss him on our pp
2193,<|emo_disgust|> You are an awful human being.
2199,<|emo_disgust|> He’s disgusting
2200,<|emo_disgust|> You fucking lost me there
2201,"<|emo_disgust|> You're a freak, a monster."
2202,<|emo_disgust|> The poor car.
2203,<|emo_disgust|> We don’t hate anybody here
2205,<|emo_disgust|> This is exactly what I said about them. It's disgusting that we're allowing it to happen.
2206,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]? Is that you?
2207,<|emo_disgust|> What a disgusting and dangerous thing to say!
2209,<|emo_disgust|> I just have no emotional connection to any of any of this because what we are witnessing is the violent toppling of a government in Turkey that was democratically elected.
2212,<|emo_disgust|> You’re creepy
2213,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] isn’t having a bounce back year and is a horrible defender. Absolutely brutal. Unabashed
2214,"<|emo_disgust|> Worst case is he just lost his friend and, worse yet, someone who he tried to help when he lost his girlfriend. "
2216,"<|emo_disgust|> People have the right to be offended at everything. But if they're offended by something, they can be arsed to change it."
2217,<|emo_disgust|> i feel offended more and more by every day amount of media i get wrong
2218,<|emo_disgust|> I feel bad for her brother. Sounds like he should be out there protesting the shit out of [NAME] over the police shootings of black men.
2219,<|emo_disgust|> Aww [NAME] this was so painful oh my god
2220,<|emo_disgust|> We already hated [NAME]. Now he's our fucking best player.
2221,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Rising seas"" would be an absolute harrasing term."
2222,<|emo_disgust|> So you're proud of the stupid things you wrote.
2223,<|emo_disgust|> He must hate you.
2224,<|emo_disgust|> That was a brutal goal
2225,"<|emo_disgust|> Your a freak, you dirty dog!"
2226,<|emo_disgust|> That's some badger I see you with my daily�
2227,<|emo_disgust|> This was posted today on instagram but I think it's safe to say the same internet hates [NAME] and [NAME]! I think [NAME] is gonna beat [NAME]!
2228,<|emo_disgust|> I'm afraid I'm gonna have to disagree with both of you.
2229,<|emo_disgust|> The last thing we need on our hands is another violent season.
2230,"<|emo_disgust|> No we dont care, the point is [NAME] is a horrible sexist."
2231,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, if he were to die that'd be a great ending for the show, imagine [NAME] throwing him a rotten apple"
2232,"<|emo_disgust|> No I'm just being sarcastic I don't need her hearing about their ""childfree lifestyle"" I want this relationship to be honest"
2234,<|emo_disgust|> It still feels odd to call someone a bitch though.
2236,<|emo_disgust|> But there’s more. He’s worse than just [NAME] and [NAME] in a lot of ways.
2237,<|emo_disgust|> i feel very selfish right now
2238,<|emo_disgust|> I’m not crying... you’re crying!
2239,<|emo_disgust|> She could have easily just run away. But then again...
2240,<|emo_disgust|> Don't forget what happened on the bus last week. You should have stopped it.
2241,<|emo_disgust|> Oh wow This sounds like utter bullshit.
2242,"<|emo_disgust|> She has no self control, if she feels she has not done something wrong she would say "" Why are you hurting my feelings"""
2243,"<|emo_disgust|> They are an angry, unpleasant lot."
2244,<|emo_disgust|> That's a lot of karma!
2245,<|emo_disgust|> No you're a terrible troll
2247,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah that sounds terrible
2249,"<|emo_disgust|> That was more of a shove than a punch. I think he was just trying to play it safe, but it was stupid."
2251,<|emo_disgust|> I mean... you can't completely police yourself though.
2252,"<|emo_disgust|> Just because they could get 1 per cent out of you, doesnt mean she actually cares."
2253,"<|emo_disgust|> I know, I know, but I still enjoy this all the time"
2255,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] what the fuck down
2256,<|emo_disgust|> i feel as if i don t deserve any sympathy for what happened to my body i was going through what s to happen to my mind
2257,<|emo_disgust|> I always hated when I got the wrong kinds of piercings. Never tried piercing in the rest of this state though honestly.
2258,<|emo_disgust|> I don't like [NAME] at all but [NAME] sucks even worse.
2260,<|emo_disgust|> i feel that i am being a little rushed
2262,<|emo_disgust|> That’s awful. I hope she’s okay. I’d do anything for that kitty.
2263,"<|emo_disgust|> Who are you, some sort of privileged moron to have decided to post that?"
2265,<|emo_disgust|> No. There’s a fine line between wanting to hurt women and being an asshole.
2266,<|emo_disgust|> i was feeling mad then
2267,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh man, this was awful. Good thing [NAME] is on our kick against SF for the win. "
2268,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] what a creepy creepy lard
2269,"<|emo_disgust|> It's almost as if the more ""diverse"" it gets, the worse it gets for conservative writers."
2271,<|emo_disgust|> Oh. That's awful.
2272,<|emo_disgust|> They are so fucking awful.
2274,<|emo_disgust|> You look miserable.
2275,<|emo_disgust|> People down voted you because your a boy. It's not weird to be a boy.
2277,"<|emo_disgust|> No, he doesn’t! It was a horrible call but I’m mad the refs didn’t call it"
2278,<|emo_disgust|> I’m a bit surprised that this isn’t a thing. Could be a creepy tip post.
2279,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that they can run around with their underwEARNINGED MAGA MAGATO SHIT TATTOO on their SHIT SHELF SHIT
2280,<|emo_disgust|> But if it is rape they should be punished to the full extent of the law.
2281,<|emo_disgust|> I know! I'll get that added insult to the injury now!
2282,<|emo_disgust|> Those girls were the worst
2283,<|emo_disgust|> Man I hate the Canuck's front office. Canuck fans are very bad at this kind of stuff.
2284,<|emo_disgust|> I'd rather have a guy be the one to say that *IS* a crime.
2285,<|emo_disgust|> He knew too damn much to let it happen in real life.
2286,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch! I felt that!
2288,"<|emo_disgust|> If the article is meant to be taken literally and not as satire, it's hilarious."
2289,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating and so disgusting that I literally can’t believe it’s happening. This country is so full of awful people.
2290,<|emo_disgust|> Why are you so angry? You're one of them privileged students!!
2292,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking useless tool.
2293,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, you're an asshole."
2294,"<|emo_disgust|> This is why I was never gonna support him, his performance was awful "
2296,<|emo_disgust|> That sucks ass I hope the parties involved get back to you about this. I enjoyed the game xD
2297,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, no, no! My room is fully cleaned and I know this Ging ground has no scent!"
2298,"<|emo_disgust|> I think it's terrible that our players have to be on an ""Optic"" alert while listening to our announcers."
2299,"<|emo_disgust|> Don't you know it's against the rule for men in dating relationships to place blame on ""bad girls""...*sherlock cough cough*"
2301,<|emo_disgust|> Soooooo yes
2302,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah the dude was obnoxious at the bar. Not an establishment with an expectation of people being drunk...
2303,<|emo_disgust|> I fucking love that scene.
2304,<|emo_disgust|> And that wig? Worst wig ever.
2305,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is my favoriteatic ffs
2306,"<|emo_disgust|> The ""Useless College Degrees From Prestigious Universities"" thing is pretty hilarious."
2307,<|emo_disgust|> He had been shot by a Vigilante!
2308,<|emo_disgust|> That's a nasty wedgie
2309,<|emo_disgust|> i feel disgusted by all this
2311,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], you poor, beautiful thing."
2314,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is making terrible decisions and is setting the tone for this culture. [NAME] is horrible at his job
2317,"<|emo_disgust|> This comment killed me, and I don't see how he's doing badly considering his age and education."
2318,<|emo_disgust|> My ex looks like [NAME] and I'm kinda jealous
2319,<|emo_disgust|> Omg did you really just scam me😪
2320,<|emo_disgust|> Why is the sun tanner than lighter for some reason. Looks dull.
2321,<|emo_disgust|> This is so scary. I love our children but this could have easily turned into a horrific dystopic nightmare.
2322,<|emo_disgust|> The absolute worst movie I've ever seen.
2323,"<|emo_disgust|> This is a good thing to know, because this is the type of shit you'll see on reddit today."
2324,<|emo_disgust|> People who say they voted for [NAME] just because its not true are either incredibly stupid or simply malicious.
2325,<|emo_disgust|> He is not a racist. He hates the very idea of racism as something that is done to get a brown person's attention.
2326,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you look at me like that!
2327,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], that's awful all the same. I hope she can bounce back. Also, [NAME] is a special case because he won't play for the Lakers forever"
2328,<|emo_disgust|> i feel really stressed
2329,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is way under rated!
2330,<|emo_disgust|> This is so Damn creepy!
2331,<|emo_disgust|> He could have just told you to fuck off.
2332,<|emo_disgust|> The dude was creepy
2333,<|emo_disgust|> Those are the worst homes I've ever seen.
2336,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I don’t want to see this
2337,<|emo_disgust|> That must have been deep throats. How do you swallow?
2338,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was always the most infuriatingly inconsistent of the bunch.
2339,<|emo_disgust|> I wanna die
2340,"<|emo_disgust|> A lot of people will say that it's because there weren't any anymore, but not true at all."
2341,<|emo_disgust|> It was a dirty hit tbh with [NAME]
2342,"<|emo_disgust|> This would be sick, if it was real. But it’s not. I think the guy is just imagining things cause he’s terrible at satire."
2343,"<|emo_disgust|> That's not how it works here, the Duggars are like the JV players on Netflix. There are too many couch potatoes."
2344,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing I disagree on is the title.
2345,"<|emo_disgust|> They did really bad, but they were still able to make the jump. That’s worth watching."
2346,<|emo_disgust|> Your dog is going crazy because you're sitting down to pee.
2347,<|emo_disgust|> Don't talk about [NAME].
2349,<|emo_disgust|> Damn. Now I really want to hear about that dust devil.
2350,"<|emo_disgust|> What's wrong with this? She's a pro, talk about her experience and why its wrong for other people."
2351,<|emo_disgust|> Not at all! And I'm glad he's okayed you!
2352,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn it [NAME]
2353,"<|emo_disgust|> A lot of women have these conversations in hushed tones, but a lot of the time it has the same effect. "
2354,<|emo_disgust|> And I didn’t like it when she broke his jaw.
2355,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] what an asshole.
2356,"<|emo_disgust|> No. It's weird and creepy and yes, there's a difference between sexual attraction and attraction to children. It's one of the first issues parents encounter when they assume the role of sexologist"
2358,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] no I thought his name was [NAME]. I was about to die
2359,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is on fire! Ahh damn!
2360,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing worse than this guy is if he doesn’t vote for [NAME].
2361,<|emo_disgust|> Omg the face
2362,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] just got their feet wet with this, they have no idea what to do with more experienced and established stars such as [NAME] nor [NAME]."
2363,"<|emo_disgust|> A girl came to the door of my apartment wondering why my girlfriend was banging on the window. I said, ""it's your girlfriend."" She said, ""its my boyfriend."""
2364,<|emo_disgust|> Don't worry. I'll get pissed if I have to.
2365,<|emo_disgust|> He’s a moron. How dare you not find domestic abuse funny.
2366,<|emo_disgust|> Damn. I was too busy laughing to notice that.
2367,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, I hate him even more now."
2368,<|emo_disgust|> I'd rather die than drive anissan.
2369,<|emo_disgust|> How can you hate a man for being a father? He cares about you! He's just selfish!
2370,"<|emo_disgust|> If I did, I'd probably tip the damn worst!"
2372,<|emo_disgust|> I find the majority of these comments offensive and hateful.
2373,<|emo_disgust|> And that is before tax. How will [NAME] ever pay for his own?
2374,<|emo_disgust|> Well that's disgusting wasn't it?
2375,"<|emo_disgust|> The worst is having too many ""we'll get around to this"" people instead of doing things the way we want to."
2376,<|emo_disgust|> My husband works for Nasa. Even the bathroom in our home office has a weird shaped thing that looks like a penis through the hole.
2377,"<|emo_disgust|> If you hate her too much, maybe watch True Blood. [NAME] is a good one."
2378,<|emo_disgust|> We could do this shit all the time. Just our school has fucked up enough already
2379,<|emo_disgust|> The most disgusting thing is your name.
2380,<|emo_disgust|> No! They are under contract! /s
2381,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds awful. Did it work for you? I’m really sorry if that happens to you. You might want to try alternative medicine
2382,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that was dirty
2383,<|emo_disgust|> I'm saying they should just kill everyone.
2384,<|emo_disgust|> It's fucking stomach churning how much these pop culture references are getting yanked.
2385,"<|emo_disgust|> Your a weirdo, and I find you a lot."
2387,<|emo_disgust|> The weird eyes.
2388,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] isn’t going to want to back your idea for a trade. Also, I’m not worried his foot is], it’s fine."
2389,<|emo_disgust|> The sad part about this is you will never be aware of any of this because most people seem to be completely blissfully ignorant.
2390,<|emo_disgust|> You don't look as good as your dad.
2391,<|emo_disgust|> Why haven’t I seen this. I love this and you. Please keep this.
2392,<|emo_disgust|> This is so attractive.
2393,<|emo_disgust|> I don't know what you're talking about but I love your username
2395,<|emo_disgust|> This is a very real thing and I’ve never experienced it but I do worry deeply for [NAME] and everyone else because it could happen to them any day
2396,"<|emo_disgust|> You mean we’re not gonna swear at him like ""oh ssssh yesssss"" because he is the lord AND queen of all rebellious teen boys and girls"
2397,<|emo_disgust|> I'm crying.
2398,<|emo_disgust|> It's so fucking creepy.
2399,"<|emo_disgust|> Not to mention, no one wants their mom to be a mean old wuss."
2400,<|emo_disgust|> Don't you know? This country is a travesty.end it.
2402,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you assume my mortality! >:O
2403,<|emo_disgust|> That was brutal. Loved that scene.
2405,<|emo_disgust|> There are people out there that support it. Stop being so critical and insulting. It is what it is.
2406,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I love the travesty of the common tongue"""
2407,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't like how this is worded. ""A man and a child"". What the fuck is your argument?"
2408,<|emo_disgust|> I’m so sick of people crying rape and murder because a few people didn’t agree with them.
2410,<|emo_disgust|> This is so terrible. Stop posting it.
2411,<|emo_disgust|> The more you wind her up the worse it gets for us
2412,<|emo_disgust|> Wow the way he just tosses the paper over the top you could eat that
2413,<|emo_disgust|> Not so much. Sometimes I wish I could get a girlfriend because I just really dont like the women there.
2414,<|emo_disgust|> This is fucking sick
2417,<|emo_disgust|> The fuck? I'm so dumb. Who even uses pen to write in?
2418,<|emo_disgust|> No wonder people hate him!
2419,<|emo_disgust|> No deal. Not going to happen. Not even entertained.
2420,<|emo_disgust|> It's the worst when its state-owned oil.
2421,<|emo_disgust|> Why would you say that? It sounds like I just don’t have trust issues
2422,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fucking monster
2423,<|emo_disgust|> You've either got no balls or are an awful human being. :(
2424,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting. What kind of parent would let something like this happen?
2425,<|emo_disgust|> Weird hand shift
2427,"<|emo_disgust|> How dare you call them ""druggies"" you fucking racist. Nowipe what you're talking about, you fucking racist."
2428,<|emo_disgust|> Who cares? It would at least give you a month or less of complaining without actually being obnoxious. 
2429,<|emo_disgust|> I am so sad. I really love [NAME]. She is the best.
2430,<|emo_disgust|> He was horrible
2431,<|emo_disgust|> There are some comments on here that are pretty disgusting.
2432,<|emo_disgust|> I'm surprised she gave him a death stare.
2433,"<|emo_disgust|> It is hard to look at, and the way it looks is disgustingly drawn."
2434,<|emo_disgust|> What a joke
2435,<|emo_disgust|> Well that's disgusting...
2436,<|emo_disgust|> Man the cabbies there are getting on our arses with these idiots saying the same fucking shit
2438,<|emo_disgust|> It’s actually a lot worse than I thought
2439,<|emo_disgust|> People need to stop applauding and giving loud cheers for a move like this or [NAME] would have been there at the same time
2440,<|emo_disgust|> I hated watching this
2441,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] fuck these calls
2442,<|emo_disgust|> So disgusting that we have to watch it because you can tell [NAME] and [NAME] are trying to be nice and then [NAME] and [NAME] come in and start smh.
2443,"<|emo_disgust|> But if we continue on the current path, we will only account for 2% of the world's population. That's awful. "
2444,<|emo_disgust|> Oh ok sorry forgot about that
2445,<|emo_disgust|> Omg no way your sister would call you creepy you know your shit right?
2446,<|emo_disgust|> Worst case scenario - everyone clapped
2447,<|emo_disgust|> A lot of times we'll do the dirty work.
2448,<|emo_disgust|> How I feel about dirty bombing. It's the dirtiest form of propaganda.
2450,"<|emo_disgust|> Lol no one can save you loser, shut up and stop trolling."
2452,<|emo_disgust|> I wish I could be that way. No way I'd ever act like [NAME].
2453,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch! Shiiiiiiit out already.
2454,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit.
2455,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking moron
2456,<|emo_disgust|> So edgy.
2457,<|emo_disgust|> This would be worse if he was a jerk who shot up a synagogue.
2458,<|emo_disgust|> If I didn't know any better I would say it was quite a weird and creepy experience
2460,<|emo_disgust|> It was done before and it was terrible
2461,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling a bit grouchy
2462,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit that's fucked up.
2463,<|emo_disgust|> Because they believe it's bad for [NAME] to be rich
2464,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck yeah. Stay on your feet.
2465,<|emo_disgust|> Well that sucks so I don't really know much about the matter but I'll probably do some digging and see if I can find anything to complain about.
2466,<|emo_disgust|> i was not feeling really bitchy for a whole day
2467,<|emo_disgust|> i don t feel offended or insulted
2468,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, what a pain in the ass."
2469,"<|emo_disgust|> Worst case scenario, he's been a bad agitator for years now."
2470,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was the worst Of any sports team Unis!!!
2471,<|emo_disgust|> What a worthless list
2473,<|emo_disgust|> It could have been worse. All the chairs and table are still upright...
2475,<|emo_disgust|> This is absolutely disgusting.
2476,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] a fucking moron.
2477,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that’s crazy
2479,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has been called everything from Lord of the Rings to Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers by readers so he has no standing to complain.
2481,"<|emo_disgust|> In all honesty, I really miss [NAME]."
2482,<|emo_disgust|> A shitty lot for a shitty team.
2483,<|emo_disgust|> i feel really annoyed when he ask me what happened and i say i can t talk about it
2484,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you state that?
2485,<|emo_disgust|> That's a big fucking lie
2486,<|emo_disgust|> Don't you cheap shot.
2487,<|emo_disgust|> It was a lousy job and looks like it was done with great care.
2488,<|emo_disgust|> He did. What a thot*
2489,"<|emo_disgust|> No, your a bitter old redcoated satan himself"
2490,<|emo_disgust|> This is worse than the [RELIGION] stuff.
2492,<|emo_disgust|> You're a miserable human being.
2493,<|emo_disgust|> The last sentence pains me
2494,"<|emo_disgust|> So, you're a weirdo."
2495,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating. It's almost as if every teacher here is an apologist for [NAME].
2496,"<|emo_disgust|> I think there's a pretty big problem with that though. You have literally no control, and you can take any action you want."
2498,<|emo_disgust|> i feel very sarcastic and angry today
2499,"<|emo_disgust|> I feel a little more sympathetic toward them. He's certainly wronged them, but they were under duress."
2500,<|emo_disgust|> She could have easily stabbed you in your sleep and killed you for sure.
2502,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is still a shitty owner and doesn't care who knows it. I'm still a fan of him
2503,"<|emo_disgust|> So, she's a pro-Assad piece of shit?"
2504,<|emo_disgust|> They're wrong about that. But the photo is still wrong.
2505,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking serious...
2506,<|emo_disgust|> That’s a lot of karma. How [NAME] handled that...
2507,<|emo_disgust|> The way he looks at people is so creepy.
2509,<|emo_disgust|> Worst to worst deal they could've got for [NAME] and [NAME]. If there's a way to make them worth more they'd help.
2510,<|emo_disgust|> > and it is far more disgusting than the video that purports to show it.
2511,<|emo_disgust|> The way I see it he should get three years. Just not in the first two. Also get a little closer to the net.
2513,<|emo_disgust|> You cant tell me they didnt give a damn about the rings because they did it after they learned of the rings existence the fuck up lol
2514,<|emo_disgust|> I mean I don’t know [NAME] and I hate the guy a little but y'all I like him ok
2515,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like im kinda a weirdo
2516,"<|emo_disgust|> That's weird to say, since [NAME] has said he hates Detroit and wants to play in Minnesota"
2517,<|emo_disgust|> No. It's creepy and weird.
2518,<|emo_disgust|> This sounds kinda terrible.
2519,<|emo_disgust|> This is so true b/c the [NAME] of horror would have said this
2520,<|emo_disgust|> What a load of garbage 🤣
2522,<|emo_disgust|> This sounds a little paranoid
2523,<|emo_disgust|> i mean i get the feeling that she knew pretty much nothing about the struggle than the people who are the most directly affected by it
2524,<|emo_disgust|> People are an awful lot worse than you are.
2525,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] that was an awful open shot....
2526,"<|emo_disgust|> Aaaand, it sucks so much oil."
2527,<|emo_disgust|> The [NAME] story is absolutely sick. I hope they catch her... before we all go mental.
2529,<|emo_disgust|> Sooooo illegal
2530,<|emo_disgust|> i feel all stressed out because we didnt get it done with everything we are supposed to
2531,<|emo_disgust|> You will hate him when he does that again.
2532,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] why? I love the show.
2533,<|emo_disgust|> That's an awful lot of karma.
2535,<|emo_disgust|> A shitpost about the death of [RELIGION].
2536,<|emo_disgust|> Those bastards lied to me
2537,<|emo_disgust|> I was a little bit skeptical about this. I honestly thought they were a little bit overpriced for what they were. I've had some really bad experiences with them.
2539,<|emo_disgust|> How is it racist? Does it amount to state-sponsored genocide? I think the burden is on the state.
2540,<|emo_disgust|> That was the worst power play I've ever seen
2541,<|emo_disgust|> If you're reading this in Canada it's probably not going to work here. Sorry!
2542,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I know, but now I regret a lot of things I said back then."
2543,<|emo_disgust|> Now this is a good idea that is why I brought this up. If she is over 20 I am a bit worried.
2544,<|emo_disgust|> The reason why I don't have a post right now is because I got a bunch of weird comments for about an hour straight.
2545,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst I've ever seen. I literally screamed.
2546,<|emo_disgust|> Wow what a fucking idiot lol
2547,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow that's just awful. What a horrible list, too."
2548,<|emo_disgust|> I've never even seen this one before. What a bizarre thing to say.
2549,"<|emo_disgust|> ""agr unque"""
2550,<|emo_disgust|> That's a load of crap!!
2551,<|emo_disgust|> This is awful... I’m Sending condolences.
2553,<|emo_disgust|> The sad Part of this story that I'm glad to hear is he eventually joined services.
2554,<|emo_disgust|> The main reason I left is because [NAME] made an offhand comment about how [NAME] should get a divorce.
2555,<|emo_disgust|> I'm so tired of this shit.
2556,"<|emo_disgust|> That's the main reason I left, and I hated it. It's not the only reason."
2557,<|emo_disgust|> They've all done it... Some of them actually wrote books.
2558,<|emo_disgust|> It's just so weird
2559,"<|emo_disgust|> And he hates losing. Which, I find extremely telling."
2560,"<|emo_disgust|> And [NAME] and [NAME] make me less angry about people, but not them. The real villains are the ones making me mad already."
2562,<|emo_disgust|> This is horrible. Good riddance.
2563,"<|emo_disgust|> Because it gives the appearance of being ""murdered by intelligent design"""
2564,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds worst.
2565,"<|emo_disgust|> Don't fuck him, if you do that, you might end up getting worse in later life. "
2566,<|emo_disgust|> That was more of a LOD than I had expected. I'm very sorry for your loss.
2569,<|emo_disgust|> It's racist.
2570,<|emo_disgust|> i think i was in my usual mood but it all happened so fast and i feel so stupid saying it all now
2571,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck this team
2572,"<|emo_disgust|> I dont care about the petty squabbles, petty hatreds and all that bullshit"
2573,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird how much I love the Burn but hate the midwestern teams more.
2574,<|emo_disgust|> It is weird because [RELIGION] is the single biggest issue for young black men. The only issue they seem to be able to come together and agree on.
2575,<|emo_disgust|> People who are too stupid to think for themselves are also too stupid to admit that humans are fucked. 
2576,<|emo_disgust|> You die.
2577,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is so horrible I'm fucking In tears.
2579,"<|emo_disgust|> The man got away with murder, but not for very long. "
2580,<|emo_disgust|> I love the busses and trolleys but that is really just my opinion.
2581,<|emo_disgust|> She’s disgusting
2582,<|emo_disgust|> Now that’s wild
2583,<|emo_disgust|> That's so disgusting. VWP
2584,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that was dirty.
2585,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like i ve been tortured for a week
2586,<|emo_disgust|> This is the first I've seen of you uttering the N-word.
2587,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I wish I could be bothered.
2588,<|emo_disgust|> Just don't call me [NAME]
2589,<|emo_disgust|> Your ass after I beat you so hard you shit yourself
2590,<|emo_disgust|> They don’t have a hand in the drafting they just have a seat in the Senate
2591,<|emo_disgust|> Man I hate that [NAME] guy
2592,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, *my* baby."
2593,<|emo_disgust|> This looks like absolute garbage
2594,<|emo_disgust|> She's passed away.
2595,<|emo_disgust|> Just terrible.
2596,<|emo_disgust|> My favourite gusgasm
2597,<|emo_disgust|> Lol no thanks. Dont give me your enthusiasm.
2599,<|emo_disgust|> Damn we have the same problems..
2600,<|emo_disgust|> I would do that but I love my 9(?????) with the welded bump stock
2601,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, I was in a car accident and had several people crush me and all the seats were firmly attached"
2603,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm the first one to say it sucks, but it's worse than being a dog."
2604,"<|emo_disgust|> Not really surprised, I was more than a little worried about the bizarre veins under his skin. "
2605,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, you didn't see his dad. I doubt he's heard of it either."
2606,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a hoe
2609,"<|emo_disgust|> The weird thing is, you don’t want any part of this if you did it. It’s beyond fucked up."
2610,<|emo_disgust|> i have been feeling quite selfish lately
2611,<|emo_disgust|> No it is they hate themselves for wanting things to change so they can be nice people to everyone else.
2612,"<|emo_disgust|> This will probably become a thing, and I'm so tired of seeing this type of hype..."
2613,"<|emo_disgust|> No, no that is your opinion. If someone asked you to stop being so mean it would be rude to refuse."
2616,"<|emo_disgust|> She didn't say no, she said *fuck it*. "
2618,"<|emo_disgust|> Those people are so full of hate and violence, I can't even handle them all "
2619,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is like ""oh, okay ok, but didn't know."""
2620,<|emo_disgust|> This is a stupid thing to say.
2621,<|emo_disgust|> And I’m not crying. I’m slinging hot sauce and smoking a blunt in my hand at this point
2622,"<|emo_disgust|> We're all against [RELIGION], not against [RELIGION]. A good number of anti-Semitic anti-ZIONISTS. "
2624,<|emo_disgust|> The comment was particularly cringe-worthy because it was coming from this very account
2626,"<|emo_disgust|> It's disgusting, and I hate it. This person should be OUTSIDED and publicly shamed."
2627,<|emo_disgust|> >it will make it even worse What a load of old shite.
2628,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is the worst coach in bulls history
2629,<|emo_disgust|> Well then its racist
2630,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn it, I think my new job requires at least a Bachelors degree in Healthcare. Well done Mr. Now I have to go to school!"
2631,<|emo_disgust|> i hate to feel like i have the wrong kind of heart
2632,<|emo_disgust|> My husband's side of the story is that he's never had a single accident thanks to his military.
2633,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] fucking no. I want this picture but his comments on the show made me sick.
2634,<|emo_disgust|> Wow. I think this is the first time I’ve ever disagreed with [NAME]. You’re the kind of man who cares about appearance more than anything else.
2635,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, that's just mindboggling"
2636,<|emo_disgust|> I wish to god I knew what sort of people live there.
2637,<|emo_disgust|> So much fucking hate.
2638,<|emo_disgust|> I wonder why they're single?
2639,<|emo_disgust|> How awful... I was about to buy this book expecting the hilarious and slapdash writing but instead it gives me a story that feels really cringy and unbelievable.
2640,<|emo_disgust|> He probably just doesn’t get it
2641,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh my gawd, did you mean ""the man"" or ""him?"" He’s so stupid, I can’t handle this anymore"
2642,<|emo_disgust|> You are disgusting and a worse anti-Semite than [NAME]
2643,<|emo_disgust|> Oh no the horror!
2644,<|emo_disgust|> Damn.
2645,"<|emo_disgust|> The weird ""semi"" has a weird meaning in Japanese."
2646,<|emo_disgust|> Oh wow I didn't know this law prohibited cities from banning handguns...
2647,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird that there isn't more of a community around it yet since we all know there are around 100 active members
2648,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds awful. If you can't afford a lawyer then what chance do you have?
2649,<|emo_disgust|> > And it will also leave you with a horrible taste in your mouth Thanks another mouthful of rotten food.
2650,<|emo_disgust|> i started off the night feeling a little frustrated that i didn t realize i was inching closer to the finish line
2651,<|emo_disgust|> That’s a pretty lousy argument to use against his side. And what the actual fuck are you talking about?
2652,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah she’s probably being a bad and angry human being right now. I hate to say it but what the fuck is getting up [NAME] now?
2653,<|emo_disgust|> i was feeling pretty petty
2654,<|emo_disgust|> I can't help but think the wife of a cop killed with his gun that's just sad.
2656,<|emo_disgust|> What? Stop.
2657,"<|emo_disgust|> Just don't call me [NAME] or [NAME] for dating you, that's just nasty."
2658,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] fucking [NAME] please no
2659,<|emo_disgust|> This is scary.
2660,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, I need this drink."
2661,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating and borderline abuse. I can't imagine thinking that's even slightly okay
2662,<|emo_disgust|> It's bad enough to be a [RELIGION] follower. Now for some comparison pics...
2663,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is an idiot for trusting her.
2664,<|emo_disgust|> I've been abused enough by my own government; this is another affront.
2665,<|emo_disgust|> i feel that we have become a rather violent society today and i feel that if the violence were directed more at peaceful targets the results might be a much better picture of us
2666,"<|emo_disgust|> So you are a disgusting,ths quoiet racist smh"
2667,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck [NAME]
2668,<|emo_disgust|> They’re just angry old men that have lost touch with reality.
2670,<|emo_disgust|> I wish I could call my mom. She would hate me.
2671,<|emo_disgust|> Holy fucking shit.
2672,<|emo_disgust|> You’re a horrible human being
2674,<|emo_disgust|> I never even knew [NAME] was [NAME] but [NAME] is freaking intimidating as fuck.
2676,<|emo_disgust|> The top comment is ridiculous.
2677,<|emo_disgust|> I mean... people are still supporting the [NAME] story and saying racist shit.
2678,<|emo_disgust|> I hope your girlfriend experiences a bad case of the blue jello.
2679,<|emo_disgust|> You're not being fair with their answer!
2680,<|emo_disgust|> Weirdly enough I also like him but his distribution is awful
2681,<|emo_disgust|> Oh wow I’m so sorry. I can imagine. I hope you do alright. Thanks for sharing. 😊
2682,"<|emo_disgust|> He lost his shoes, what are you going to do with them?"
2684,<|emo_disgust|> What in the world did these guys just say? Are they confused about whether or not they'll be covered by insurance?
2685,<|emo_disgust|> And I thought it was weird that a man with a weird beard could find a home here.
2687,<|emo_disgust|> You're ugly
2688,<|emo_disgust|> This is a cruel thing to say to someone with depression.
2689,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn that sucks. You have a good life now. Stay strong
2690,<|emo_disgust|> You are a disgrace to the species
2691,"<|emo_disgust|> You can't get off at that address. No matter who you are, get off the roads and sidewalks."
2692,<|emo_disgust|> No but I do hate the way he talks in that thick Jersey accent.
2693,"<|emo_disgust|> Not sure if that was sarcasm or just plain stupid, but fuck it"
2694,<|emo_disgust|> Now this I find extremely disheartening.
2696,<|emo_disgust|> What a nightmare.
2698,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] this is how you get a gun fight with an angry old granny.
2700,<|emo_disgust|> i feel really bitchy and angry for her for going through that
2701,<|emo_disgust|> Lol so you're a racist?
2702,<|emo_disgust|> It's almost comical how many times this has been said.
2704,"<|emo_disgust|> No, because you're a fucking idiot and you're not being asked. "
2705,<|emo_disgust|> It was a horrible error by the GM. What a horrible situation for her to be in.
2706,<|emo_disgust|> The amount of hate and kindness the [RELIGION] church and mosque community has towards non followers of any faith is horrifying.
2707,<|emo_disgust|> This is me all the time and I hate it.
2708,<|emo_disgust|> This guy looks like he's trying to pass the hot dog out of a soda can at high speed.
2710,"<|emo_disgust|> Because it's more profit, stupid."
2711,<|emo_disgust|> This is like saying that the football team is trash and the fan is just a asshole. It's a stereotype.
2712,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, I didn’t know that wasn’t true"
2713,"<|emo_disgust|> I’ve heard horrible things about the cast of Greys, Greys worst being [NAME]..."
2714,<|emo_disgust|> I’m just going to say this now so you better shut up or you’ll be banned from BSN Broncos Facebook page
2715,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is such a horrible defender, and we love him!"
2716,<|emo_disgust|> He must hate how much people listen to him...
2717,<|emo_disgust|> Just because you want happiness doesn’t mean you’ll experience it. If you want it you’ll have to find a new way to get it!
2718,"<|emo_disgust|> That's an awful lot worse than a tap the fuck out and say ""your mother is a horrible person."""
2720,"<|emo_disgust|> If you don't like it, don't use it."
2721,<|emo_disgust|> Weird how you could get that far but not that far
2722,<|emo_disgust|> The thing that truly makes this horrifying is that these are the same people that tell lies to get attention and sympathy.
2723,<|emo_disgust|> What a nightmare
2724,"<|emo_disgust|> It's a weird thing to be expected to do, especially when the goal is to score."
2725,<|emo_disgust|> That was a horrible open shot.... [NAME] missed at least 3 of those
2726,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch! My hear sank. Don’t make the same mistake!
2727,<|emo_disgust|> You're trash
2728,<|emo_disgust|> Man fuck I didn't know that we were gonna nose Duppinsville while he was playing.
2729,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm a woman and a human being, and that's pretty damn disgusting in and of itself."
2730,<|emo_disgust|> This article is trash. Please leave.
2731,<|emo_disgust|> i want to say i feel offended but i m not
2732,<|emo_disgust|> You've been banned for posting the same thing but in a public place.
2734,"<|emo_disgust|> He really likes to scream ""MOTHERFUCKER!"" while riding his scooter."
2735,<|emo_disgust|> Sooooooo inappropriate
2736,<|emo_disgust|> That face you're looking at is so ugly...I hate faces
2737,<|emo_disgust|> i feel a bit rebellious tonight
2738,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, [NAME] has a fuckingormous learning disability..."
2739,"<|emo_disgust|> No way, they both have the same amount of posts. They're just more active. "
2740,<|emo_disgust|> You're in for a rude awakening
2741,<|emo_disgust|> This comment is the worst.
2742,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. But it's much worse to say you don't want to live and are willing to die.
2743,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, the ebrats have a point. It's just that I’m really angry about the whole ""no-bid"" situation and the bullshit around it. "
2745,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was not a ""thing"" but rather just a friend. He was not a creepy creep "
2746,<|emo_disgust|> The only interesting thing about this is how well-policed it is. Seems pretty well-policed.
2747,<|emo_disgust|> Oh whoops haha
2748,<|emo_disgust|> Oh sure sure what you meant. I’m glad not to be in your mess.
2749,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, you can't just ""tweak"" anything to ""appearance"". That's just stupid"
2750,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn it, [NAME]!"
2751,"<|emo_disgust|> And it is worse, they are not getting the help they need"
2752,<|emo_disgust|> It is weird and depressing and beautiful and terrible and wholesome and all at the same time
2753,<|emo_disgust|> Damn who’s next on the list..?
2754,<|emo_disgust|> This is the single worst Twitter account to follow lately
2755,<|emo_disgust|> He looks like he sweats a lot.
2757,"<|emo_disgust|> Well unless you're ugly, which you clearly are..."
2758,<|emo_disgust|> That's weird. I think I just have bad ears.
2759,<|emo_disgust|> I had a nightmare about that one >:((
2760,<|emo_disgust|> You're a horrible human being.
2761,<|emo_disgust|> You're a mean person
2762,"<|emo_disgust|> I’d take [NAME]. I like him a lot, but this looks awful"
2763,<|emo_disgust|> The media ruined a kid's life for no reason. What a world we live in.
2764,<|emo_disgust|> I just really hate them and i hope this makes you feel less awful about choice.
2765,"<|emo_disgust|> Just keep going, baby. It's literally making me sick."
2766,<|emo_disgust|> It’s a bad idea.
2767,<|emo_disgust|> I hate that I like her...
2768,<|emo_disgust|> Who is afraid of whom? We'll have all the emojis we need to get pissed off about this.
2769,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I wanna die already
2770,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting. No one should act like this. You deserve better than this.
2771,"<|emo_disgust|> The only one of these that i want to be a fan of, but sadly none of the others were available on GOG. Sorry."
2773,<|emo_disgust|> This is fucking disgusting.
2774,<|emo_disgust|> > But he went out of his way to apologize for being ugly and didn't say anything about his own mental health. So you can say that he is a terrible person.
2776,<|emo_disgust|> The most disgusting thing I've ever seen. Take my upvote.
2778,<|emo_disgust|> This is so creepy. Good riddance to awful rubbish. I've watched it twice. Not worth it.
2779,<|emo_disgust|> It's a disgusting lot to deal with
2780,<|emo_disgust|> This is my favorite scene in the whole series
2782,<|emo_disgust|> That's a great way to get banned from that sub.
2783,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has the worst potential shot of any forward in this draft and the best attributes. This is why I hate him so much
2787,<|emo_disgust|> So I've just given up. Look me up.
2788,"<|emo_disgust|> Well damn, I hate it when mom and dad fight."
2791,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating. I hate it.
2792,<|emo_disgust|> Now that’s crazy
2793,"<|emo_disgust|> Not that's the problem, it's the lack of a clear direction. Where is the [NAME] policy?"
2794,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh yeah, the original one with [NAME]"
2796,<|emo_disgust|> He was fired less than two months after he was charged.
2797,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck [NAME] for putting in with him like a friend. I felt bad for [NAME] but he just wasn't worth it
2798,<|emo_disgust|> What a stupid list
2799,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh god, no."
2800,<|emo_disgust|> He needs a drink. Or a cig.
2801,<|emo_disgust|> I feel like being cruel and name calling would make her less likeable and less understanding. That's my point.
2802,<|emo_disgust|> And they are angry.
2803,<|emo_disgust|> So you are not from Saudi Arabia then. Pretty scary.
2804,<|emo_disgust|> Why would you doubt it...
2805,<|emo_disgust|> Don't even bother. They're getting all the free publicity. Just fire them like everybody said they would.
2806,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a vicious little shill for [RELIGION]!!!!
2807,"<|emo_disgust|> Because it's so infuriating: ""I didn't vote for you [NAME] I didn't like the first choice"" "
2808,<|emo_disgust|> I just have high standards for that and I'm appalled that you've failed them.
2809,<|emo_disgust|> So sorry that you had to go through all this. I hope you don't ever have to go through this.
2810,<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting. You should be ashamed.
2811,<|emo_disgust|> The only one we could get to do an unmask.
2812,<|emo_disgust|> But it's better than just burning them all down? That makes less sense than just burning them all down.
2813,<|emo_disgust|> What a cruelly poetic fact!
2814,<|emo_disgust|> I'm jealous.
2815,<|emo_disgust|> A stupid [NAME] sign
2816,<|emo_disgust|> You sound upset.
2817,"<|emo_disgust|> My dad has recently died, he was 90. My mom is 76. I still feel like there's so many unfathomable things that my mommas could've done."
2819,"<|emo_disgust|> The only issue I'm hearing is him being immature and trying to court girls with an attractive face. Very unattractive, yet attractive."
2822,<|emo_disgust|> i feel extremely impatient
2823,<|emo_disgust|> This is so awful that i literally did not even want to comment. I genuinely cannot believe these are the values that drove [NAME] and his actions.
2824,<|emo_disgust|> We’re going for broke in 2019 huh? What a steal that pick was
2826,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm not a [NAME] guy, but from the sounds of it, [NAME] will be the next [NAME]..."
2827,<|emo_disgust|> That's one dirty Canuck
2828,"<|emo_disgust|> When all you heard was grumbling about how hard it was for him to get into Harvard, you had a pretty good idea of what he was about. "
2829,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, you are disgusting"
2830,"<|emo_disgust|> My dad hates [NAME] too, but I’d be really pissed if I was his dad..."
2831,<|emo_disgust|> Fuuuuck. I literally can’t believe you’re saying this
2832,<|emo_disgust|> I can't stand [NAME].
2833,<|emo_disgust|> Oh boy! Who will pay for it?
2834,<|emo_disgust|> I was like *fuck off*
2835,<|emo_disgust|> You can't really hear it through the trash can on the right.
2837,<|emo_disgust|> i felt guilty for caring
2838,"<|emo_disgust|> It’s been the same old pattern of giving her all the money when she doesn’t pay or when they do have more money, which leaves her feeling worse and worse till she ends up paying the overdue balance."
2839,<|emo_disgust|> There have been a lot of unfortunate events on/off the racetrack this year. It's pretty damn bad.
2842,<|emo_disgust|> What I find disgusting is the level of apathy and ignorance this thread has received.
2844,<|emo_disgust|> i always think it may be im just being stubborn at the moment but i would just be so upset to see no sign of her
2845,<|emo_disgust|> I've noticed lately that there's a lot of hate on OKC for some bad things that have happened in the area in the past.
2846,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking disgusting.
2847,<|emo_disgust|> It hurts to watch
2848,<|emo_disgust|> That is NOT a fucking contract
2850,<|emo_disgust|> This is a guy's post. Don't pretend to be this guy.
2851,"<|emo_disgust|> Fuck off, [NAME]. Your company sucks, move on to other IPOs and investments."
2852,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not crying. You're crying
2853,<|emo_disgust|> What the hell does [NAME] know about foreign policy?
2854,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a very dangerous man
2855,"<|emo_disgust|> I get it but I hate when I read ""I got what I deserve"""
2857,<|emo_disgust|> I knew a guy who was like this. He was a guard for years on a college campus and went on to play in the league for like three years
2858,<|emo_disgust|> Who cares because [NAME] is a worse [NAME].
2859,<|emo_disgust|> I actually took a picture of one of them getting irrationally angry and I am so fucking disgusted at how big his anger was
2860,"<|emo_disgust|> You're the worst kind of person, all that + 20 years under your belt."
2861,"<|emo_disgust|> If it's ""soaked in sauce"" doesn't change the recipe by one bit."
2862,<|emo_disgust|> That is awful and disgusting. I’m so sorry that you experienced that.
2863,<|emo_disgust|> How is this racist? Does it even matter that half the country are BAME? Stop making fun and playing games.
2864,"<|emo_disgust|> I was never one for romantic comedies, but I'm falling in love with this one."
2865,<|emo_disgust|> You've been called a troll a thousand times. I'm not sure what you are about but I've done worse.
2867,"<|emo_disgust|> This sounds really bad, what should be done? I am so, so sorry, and I hope you are doing better!"
2868,<|emo_disgust|> Weird situation
2869,<|emo_disgust|> This is one of the worst I've seen....
2870,<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell thinks he isn’t overpaid
2871,<|emo_disgust|> > And worse He did just say that
2878,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] doesn't want the floor and he's willing to dish. Love that.
2879,"<|emo_disgust|> It's a terrible analogy. capitalism is a state run by the people, it's the private property based freemasons that are the problem. "
2880,<|emo_disgust|> I've had worse.
2882,"<|emo_disgust|> The top comment is the most telling: ""its disgusting"" "
2885,<|emo_disgust|> She was trying to use [NAME] as a talking points during an appearance on The Jim Rome Show. I don't believe she made a terrible choice.
2886,<|emo_disgust|> i feel a sense of anxiety and dread every time i look out over the sea
2887,<|emo_disgust|> That looks a lot worse tbh with the skin tone
2888,<|emo_disgust|> The world is a crueler place than you imagine.
2889,<|emo_disgust|> I am not a fan. The writing is horrible though.
2890,"<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck are you talking about [NAME]? I'm 21, I would never call myself fat, I'm just chunky "
2891,"<|emo_disgust|> This thread is a thing? Oh no, I know about you, me and my friends just don’t like that 😂"
2892,<|emo_disgust|> Who is boring? Who here wants to be told what to do by someone who actually cares about them.
2894,<|emo_disgust|> I'll go much further. That's disgusting.
2896,<|emo_disgust|> Well I am scared that the other person will think I am a fake and will try to approach me or approach a girl.
2897,<|emo_disgust|> I think all the people that have threatened him should be brought to justice.
2898,<|emo_disgust|> It's pretty cringe.
2899,"<|emo_disgust|> He has a strange sense of humor. Like, what, is wrong with him?"
2900,<|emo_disgust|> > She got a nasty surprise when she broke off a relationship with a guy who had been with her for years. Well no.
2902,<|emo_disgust|> Wow that’s awful. I’m so sorry that you’re going through that. Can you get a little sleep now?
2903,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn I need to find out what breed these things are, I think I have a Furcerus mohawk and a pitbull terrier mix to trade for this"
2904,"<|emo_disgust|> This is a horrible tip, OP. Please think before doing something like this."
2905,<|emo_disgust|> Just think of the idiots who have been to a gun show and seen the people buying assault weapons!
2906,<|emo_disgust|> People are so horrible
2907,<|emo_disgust|> The fucking worst game I've ever seen [NAME] play.
2908,<|emo_disgust|> How dare they not have the same apprehensions for our safety as other countries do?!
2909,<|emo_disgust|> My balls shrunk up looking at that
2910,<|emo_disgust|> You're just too ugly to get away with something like that.
2911,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not disgusting. I'm disgusting because I actually want to be disgusted
2912,<|emo_disgust|> My only regret is not finding a copy of this book a LONG time ago... :/
2913,<|emo_disgust|> I'm a terrible person but yes I have had this happening to me multiple times.
2914,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck I’m hungry now
2915,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]...I don’t want to hear it.
2916,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking moron lol
2917,<|emo_disgust|> He can't get the ball out of his hand. Which is odd considering he's 2/10 on the pick and roll
2918,"<|emo_disgust|> You shut your stupid mouth you shill, you're fucking useless."
2920,"<|emo_disgust|> You’re an awful human being, and yes, I’m sorry for your loss."
2921,<|emo_disgust|> The fake news media is having a field day with this ridiculousity!
2922,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm so jealous. I've never even heard of them, but they're one of the only Chinese companies that I hear are legit."
2923,<|emo_disgust|> Not what I'm talking about. This is a very bad place to be in.
2924,"<|emo_disgust|> You're the Worst kind of person, but still I like you. No reason to change now. "
2925,<|emo_disgust|> That’s ridiculous. You’re disgusting
2926,<|emo_disgust|> Oh you mean karma?
2927,"<|emo_disgust|> So the purpose of this was to create the appearance of having a healthy lifestyle, while also making a buck.. I'm dumb"
2928,<|emo_disgust|> I can’t do that to my wife! That’s just...so awful
2929,<|emo_disgust|> Thats a lot of karma! What a fuckin n
2930,<|emo_disgust|> [RELIGION] gets funding but is it being used to target [RELIGION] people? No.
2931,<|emo_disgust|> She reminds me of Ginger from Ginger Snaps but is also 6 feet tall and a skin queen that can't eat anything smaller than a forks hand
2932,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like someone has insulted me in some way
2933,"<|emo_disgust|> A lot of these comments are disgusting and offensive. If you care about fighting fascism, get out now."
2934,"<|emo_disgust|> That's crazy, he's 30 and hasn’t even done anything to earn that much hate. "
2935,<|emo_disgust|> They're not a group theists are afraid to talk about and aren't willing to be victimized by religion
2936,<|emo_disgust|> There is no limit to the number of hits you can record on YouTube. It’s up to you how much you want to put into it then.
2938,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating. The only thing that saved him was his family. The rest he destroyed. So selfish and so evil.
2939,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, what a surprise /r/tworeddit What a fucking stranger"
2940,"<|emo_disgust|> And they would hate us, the least!"
2941,<|emo_disgust|> What a thot*
2942,"<|emo_disgust|> She's a creep, plain and simple. "
2943,<|emo_disgust|> That is awful. Can't imagine having a girlfriend you have sex with other than once a week or so then.
2944,"<|emo_disgust|> So basically, she is both worse and bigger than [NAME]"
2945,<|emo_disgust|> I think you're talking about the wrong sub.
2946,<|emo_disgust|> Oh god the hypocrisy.
2947,"<|emo_disgust|> People really think about these things a lot, and it's pretty cringe."
2948,<|emo_disgust|> Awe! That sucks! I bet youre fun at parties.
2949,<|emo_disgust|> She's a horrible choice for president.
2950,<|emo_disgust|> Man I hate people who have no idea what [NAME] has been up to since the end of his career
2951,<|emo_disgust|> Holy Moly. These people are so awful.
2952,<|emo_disgust|> How is it racist? What about symbolically racist?
2953,<|emo_disgust|> I feel sorry for the kids watching. Sounds spasticated.
2954,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is really bad with his deals but i love the Chiefs so I hate the Chargers a lot
2955,<|emo_disgust|> Oh I didn't change any of the numbers in your post. Stop lying.
2957,<|emo_disgust|> People are idiots.
2958,<|emo_disgust|> I could care less!
2959,"<|emo_disgust|> It makes me soo uncomfortable to read comments like this. Please keep these people out of our games, bud. "
2960,"<|emo_disgust|> He was, and it is. If you have children with him, it is YOUR business."
2961,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah. I’d rather be hated because of my work than because of my sex.
2962,"<|emo_disgust|> What, again? I’m dumb as shit and thinking that [NAME] is playing dirty is crazy, he’s just waiting for the last�� second!?!?!?!?!"
2963,<|emo_disgust|> No you're a horrible human being.
2965,<|emo_disgust|> That looks more like fake news than actual news. Fucking hate that.
2966,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, damn, I forgot about that. He was awful for a while."
2967,<|emo_disgust|> This is pretty gross and disgusting... what is [NAME] doing in your area?
2968,<|emo_disgust|> No fucking clue
2969,<|emo_disgust|> This is some fucking gross shit.
2971,<|emo_disgust|> This is bad
2972,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, come off. This sub is very about drama and anger rather than serious consideration. "
2973,<|emo_disgust|> I'm getting a little annoyed at how many of you are talking about a different thread than what actually happened.
2974,<|emo_disgust|> If you don’t like [NAME] then feel free to move on.
2975,"<|emo_disgust|> It's kinda creepy, but I don't think their minds are damaged by all of this."
2976,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh damn, I'd forgotten that. Thanks!"
2977,"<|emo_disgust|> Lol I’d trade him, he’s not good enough to keep"
2979,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Fuck off. You have no idea what fascism looks like in practice."""
2980,<|emo_disgust|> That’s just bad. It could have gone better. That’s just bad
2981,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like this just was a bit rushed in my room and since i feel this was a rushed process there is no fault to be found
2982,<|emo_disgust|> > What a disgusting list
2983,<|emo_disgust|> It's a fact that there's plenty of room in between the existing structure. Why the city isn't doing anything to improve upon the existing situation is beyond me
2984,<|emo_disgust|> i feeling so hated
2985,"<|emo_disgust|> If you're not out of control by then, you're under control. You're not out of control, you're an emotional idiot or something."
2987,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that we just put [NAME] in the minors gives me cause for worry
2988,"<|emo_disgust|> No one has said anything negative about [RELIGION], it's a pretty troubled history."
2990,<|emo_disgust|> It's a strange thing to be unsure about yourself.
2991,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn it, I thought [NAME] had a pretty bad 2017..."
2992,<|emo_disgust|> They're all bad in their own way though.
2993,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, that's actually awesome lol"
2994,<|emo_disgust|> It doesn't. It makes me want to kick her out.
2995,<|emo_disgust|> What the hell were you thinking when you posted the third picture
2996,<|emo_disgust|> It's literally crazy the number of gun away robberies that are reported to police every week.
2997,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck man I really like playing this game.
2998,<|emo_disgust|> I hated the movie until I got to see it at a festival.
2999,<|emo_disgust|> That and it's a fucking shitty tattoo.
3000,<|emo_disgust|> Oh I hate him even more now.
3001,<|emo_disgust|> I'll put it another way: Fuck off.
3003,<|emo_disgust|> This is so disgusting that it's almost adorable.
3004,<|emo_disgust|> Omg the girl who got cut off the arms of a truck driver who injured her... WTF?
3005,<|emo_disgust|> The guy is a very well known left winger and accuses us of being racist for wanting to protect the weak.
3006,<|emo_disgust|> It is really weird how many different people think this can’t happen because of [NAME].
3007,<|emo_disgust|> A few months back I said that [NAME] has weird fkin skills. Well since he's been here for a while now he has even worse.
3008,<|emo_disgust|> You're a weirdo.
3009,<|emo_disgust|> Because it looked worse than a poster for a horror movie.
3010,<|emo_disgust|> She also deleted her own account on Twitter before her death. Weird.
3011,<|emo_disgust|> It was horrible. One of my worst nightmares actually. I can’t imagine going through something like that
3012,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't know the man but damn it, it smacks that way."
3013,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is probably the dumbest psycho out there, that dude's like a psychopathic walking stick"
3014,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Lazy ass dawg"""
3015,<|emo_disgust|> That's what you get for running a business online.
3016,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking hate [NAME] too
3017,<|emo_disgust|> Worst movie character ever
3020,"<|emo_disgust|> We have to do this, the bastards are coming we don't have time to waste."
3021,<|emo_disgust|> How do we know [NAME] is still alive? I'm so sad.
3022,<|emo_disgust|> Who doesn’t know about [NAME] scam? I’m just telling you about it lol. Don’t do it
3023,<|emo_disgust|> This made me nauseous
3025,<|emo_disgust|> This is a terrible list. Now I am sad. Oh [NAME].
3026,<|emo_disgust|> I would never put any blame on the bus driver for not properly signaling to others that they could pass
3027,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, fuck you."
3029,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is just killing it right now
3030,<|emo_disgust|> i feel more than a little resentful for my age difference
3031,"<|emo_disgust|> > No, the whole purpose of it is that he's hated by the whole community."
3032,"<|emo_disgust|> The lack of any decent control over the squad, and what amounts to an abysmal lack of communication between management and players, is actually pretty disgusting."
3033,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is always wrong about everything.
3034,"<|emo_disgust|> >How I've never been able to get one girl to agree to sex after two phone sex conversations, wow."
3035,<|emo_disgust|> It's so infuriating to watch.
3036,<|emo_disgust|> > and there's always a reason... There are always reasons we shouldn't be putting laws into place like this.
3037,<|emo_disgust|> Oh damn I should've left. What a horrible host. 
3038,"<|emo_disgust|> If it's in Canada, at least it was on video, there's still a chance it will be found and charged... sucks no way around it, the guy was clearly making a stupid mistake. "
3039,<|emo_disgust|> i feel rather disgusted that the mediaite crowd and the usual suspects would have a say in my life
3040,<|emo_disgust|> Worst dad ever.
3041,<|emo_disgust|> Because they hate freedom
3042,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I had to go through something awful"" Is a pretty horrific story."
3043,<|emo_disgust|> This is not a hate sub it just takes some getting used to.
3045,<|emo_disgust|> This is what I imagine to be the distraught owner of a clothing store screaming and pointing in the direction of some distraught toddler.
3046,<|emo_disgust|> The weird ways the Nets roll
3047,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a madman....
3048,<|emo_disgust|> I have this very disorder and it’s terrible. The only thing that can stop it from happening is a therapist.
3049,"<|emo_disgust|> Fuck off, you don't know anything about fascism, democracy, or capitalism!"
3050,"<|emo_disgust|> Lol, yessir you got yer bae all messed up."
3051,<|emo_disgust|> What a weird post omg
3052,<|emo_disgust|> So much hate.
3053,"<|emo_disgust|> Lol [NAME] just called me a cunt for saying ""fuck it"" and told me I wasnt hot any more."
3054,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, [NAME] looks miserable in those photos. "
3055,<|emo_disgust|> He is a professional emo who has been called a lot of things but that's just projection
3056,<|emo_disgust|> That’s worse
3057,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so incredibly wronged
3059,<|emo_disgust|> She was charged with aggravated assault. She posted bond and posted online.
3060,<|emo_disgust|> A bit creepy.
3061,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] fucking dammit
3062,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit that right there is the single worst Twitter moment of the year so far
3063,<|emo_disgust|> The only unpleasant thing about this man is how open he is with it.
3065,<|emo_disgust|> I thought I was the only one complaining about this.
3067,<|emo_disgust|> Omg this is repulsive
3068,<|emo_disgust|> That looks like total garbage to me.
3069,<|emo_disgust|> Sooooo.... They went all out for her. That’s awful.
3070,<|emo_disgust|> This guy should go to HELL
3071,<|emo_disgust|> Why even exist if all you know is that [NAME] was a satanist?
3072,<|emo_disgust|> What a piece of crap!!
3073,"<|emo_disgust|> I think it might be racism. It's all so familiar. ""You don't belong here"" to black families. Same with brown families."
3075,"<|emo_disgust|> Don't worry, it'll all get better soon alright...?"
3076,<|emo_disgust|> >I feel like such a loner too I'm actually shocked that anyone can agree with you.
3077,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird to think about the state of post-apocalyptic America without the zombie virus.
3078,<|emo_disgust|> It’s so fucking disgusting
3079,<|emo_disgust|> Damn don’t sell your soul for a fucking trophy
3080,<|emo_disgust|> Man I hate these takes
3081,<|emo_disgust|> This is so disgusting. VWP
3082,<|emo_disgust|> It's creepy that this question doesn't get asked more often “are you in love”.
3083,<|emo_disgust|> It’s more of a burden cuz I have no friends.
3086,<|emo_disgust|> I hate how much I love it
3087,<|emo_disgust|> How can you be so wrong though? Your sister has been in jail for years now. I’m just glad you’re not a racist.
3088,<|emo_disgust|> That dress was awful.
3089,"<|emo_disgust|> I miss [NAME], my man!"
3090,<|emo_disgust|> The best revenge stories I've ever read. Fuckin' LUCIO
3091,<|emo_disgust|> Lol you're saying he hasn't been charged with anything and not even charged with assault? Interesting hypocrisy.
3092,<|emo_disgust|> What a disgusting person she is
3094,<|emo_disgust|> Because killing other humans is wrong?
3095,<|emo_disgust|> I'm so sad how good it was though. The music was great but [NAME] voice is terrible...
3096,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] it makes me want to die
3097,<|emo_disgust|> Your comment was in bad taste but notuckland style.
3098,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]! Shut up, [NAME]!"
3100,"<|emo_disgust|> And why is it ""postponing the retirement"" when the rules say you have to wait till age 59 to get Social Security?"
3101,"<|emo_disgust|> Shut your dumb mouth libtard, you dippy cunt"
3102,<|emo_disgust|> I have a hard time sleeping in socks. The fuzzy ones are the worst because they slide around on my feet. You can get away with just fuzzy ones though
3103,<|emo_disgust|> You just didn't like the other man.
3104,<|emo_disgust|> Weird. I’m 30 and still single.
3105,"<|emo_disgust|> When you live in a bubble then you are a bubble, bubble up, bubble down "
3106,"<|emo_disgust|> My son just called me a fat moron for using only natural beauty products, is this some divine thing?"
3107,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst I've ever seen. Take my upvote.
3108,<|emo_disgust|> What a pathetic effort. What a waste of money.
3109,<|emo_disgust|> > You can't have your cake and eat it Because apparently your cake is too damn big to be eaten.
3111,<|emo_disgust|> You are quite possibly dating a child predator.
3112,<|emo_disgust|> Oh this poor sap
3113,<|emo_disgust|> You're an awful person
3114,"<|emo_disgust|> I’m not a animal, I’m a human being"
3115,<|emo_disgust|> Not any less disgusting.
3116,<|emo_disgust|> It's the worst when it's something you have no control over
3117,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is the mode called normal mode where you're in a training mode and can only aim with theAim stick
3118,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry you're having that problem, but I can just do them as homework on my computer."
3119,<|emo_disgust|> The lack of options in the sub makes it an absolute joke
3120,<|emo_disgust|> Oh the horror!
3121,<|emo_disgust|> i have a feeling that it s going to get messy
3122,<|emo_disgust|> That poor janitor. Good thing he didn't swallow his hat.
3123,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I'm so sorry that you experience that way.
3124,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I want that guy dead, that's why I came here""."
3125,"<|emo_disgust|> What makes you say that? That’s very shaky news for /r/television, [NAME] fans."
3126,<|emo_disgust|> I've had sleep paralysis once... it was worse than the video...
3127,<|emo_disgust|> i remember feeling very very agitated at that point
3128,"<|emo_disgust|> You don't have to hate it or anything, [NAME] is a good person and the examples he gave are enough. Stop being afraid to face your issues head on."
3129,<|emo_disgust|> He still cares about his job. Look at his comments to the contrary. He's still a fucking idiot.
3130,<|emo_disgust|> You want them to fight [NAME]? Let them. It will make themless of [NAME] after he disrespected [NAME]
3131,<|emo_disgust|> You’re not banned for saying “fuck off men” - you’re banned for “calling men”.
3132,<|emo_disgust|> That's your excuse?
3133,<|emo_disgust|> And you're still young :(
3134,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Cult""? I think I’m in the weed business for a second. I still love weed though. It’s just gotten weird since coke."
3135,"<|emo_disgust|> Holy crap, what a steal that was. "
3136,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is ugly
3137,<|emo_disgust|> It’s one of the weirdest talking points I’ve heard on here. The only thing worse is him saying it in an actual local voice.
3138,"<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell thinks ""fuck it"" is not a good idea"
3140,<|emo_disgust|> Damn. They’re the ones being racist here
3141,"<|emo_disgust|> This is like the 8th worst thing I've ever seen on Reddit. Notions of goodness, goodness......don't exist anymore."
3143,"<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit, you right... that is an awful amount of bp for 15 kills"
3144,<|emo_disgust|> I was surprised too
3146,<|emo_disgust|> She’s one big wet puppy.
3148,<|emo_disgust|> Damn now I feel bad for these guys
3149,<|emo_disgust|> > They just did a video with them apparently
3150,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds terrible.
3151,<|emo_disgust|> That is odd.
3152,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow dad, what a weird question..."
3153,"<|emo_disgust|> I do, but I’m a [NAME] guy."
3154,<|emo_disgust|> I don’t think there is anything moreane in the world than this man. Get some help.
3155,<|emo_disgust|> He is a moron for letting him.
3156,<|emo_disgust|> He has a habit of wearing swim trunks to parties.
3158,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I'm so sorry that your friend got that far. I hope you have a great life now.
3159,<|emo_disgust|> I fucking hate [NAME]
3160,<|emo_disgust|> She did say she liked my hair.
3161,<|emo_disgust|> I am not happy and I do not want to live in this world
3162,<|emo_disgust|> I remember this as the one where [NAME] got away with an illegal FOUR count while he was away for the year
3163,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, you're just a big deal, huh?"
3164,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah it's disgusting
3166,<|emo_disgust|> This video makes me want to die
3167,<|emo_disgust|> That was worse than a movie jump scare. I can't imagine they made it good enough for that...
3168,<|emo_disgust|> I think some of us are. She’s an angry and abusive person. Not a good mom.
3169,"<|emo_disgust|> A few months ago, there was talk of a revamp of the tank because of the high kill rates on the reaper. "
3170,<|emo_disgust|> Damn we need a [NAME] moment
3172,"<|emo_disgust|> That's not a copypasta, it's an example of a spammy title. Ffs."
3175,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh yeah, they're all so expensive."
3177,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] why would you trash your dad
3178,<|emo_disgust|> i feel a little bit annoyed
3179,<|emo_disgust|> Holy moly.
3180,<|emo_disgust|> I'll kill you I'll kill you
3181,"<|emo_disgust|> This is horrifying. An autism mum would never do this. The mother must have mental health issues, she must be in deep shit."
3182,<|emo_disgust|> They want to make it look so bad
3183,<|emo_disgust|> Not really cringe though. Just sad.
3186,"<|emo_disgust|> That picture is a prime example of a Jokic goal that could have been much worse, but the refs gave it the best of chances and got it"
3187,<|emo_disgust|> How is that not a hate crime? I find it really disturbing that they're singling out one woman.
3188,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I hate Twitter
3189,"<|emo_disgust|> If something is broken in your back, it's probably best to get your ass offbars, etc"
3190,<|emo_disgust|> Man I hate those days man... back to back to back against Nashville and Vegas 
3191,<|emo_disgust|> I still cant believe he used the N-word.
3192,<|emo_disgust|> She didn't even try to argue her point
3193,<|emo_disgust|> But there’s no way around it! Get a new job you worthless piece of shit
3194,<|emo_disgust|> Lol I just hate everything about this
3195,"<|emo_disgust|> The whole time I was there I thought, “Geez you”."
3196,<|emo_disgust|> Those bags must stink
3197,<|emo_disgust|> Wow. What a load of old shite.
3198,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is ‘antibiotics’
3199,"<|emo_disgust|> That’s a terrible tip, OP. Fries and beer are a lot more forgiving then tacos and bud"
3202,<|emo_disgust|> They're still the dumbest team to watch. :( That dumbass from behind the gym steps in front of your dude to pass you the basketball.
3203,<|emo_disgust|> I think the most telling part is how calm [NAME] looked when he was telling the story.
3204,"<|emo_disgust|> And yet, they're all the rage!"
3205,<|emo_disgust|> Holy crap that's bad
3206,<|emo_disgust|> But it’s terrible. If it’s good its great. If it’s bad its horrifying.
3207,<|emo_disgust|> Those are the things that made me the most angry in gaming...
3209,<|emo_disgust|> It's a shame that [NAME] did a series of horrific things despite having these superpowers.
3210,<|emo_disgust|> How does this sub Work.... Its very simple! No ads
3211,<|emo_disgust|> The worst news is no one is coming to your town. Stay out of it as best you can.
3212,<|emo_disgust|> I don't know enough about their affairs to hold a grudge against them
3213,<|emo_disgust|> Man oh man... I just knew like two months ago. :(
3214,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like a greedy little shit because theres just so much to take in
3215,<|emo_disgust|> That fucking Mills charge is FUCKING BULLSHIT
3216,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a very bad writer.
3217,<|emo_disgust|> The [NAME] has really bad defender
3218,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I'm not hot at all. Are you a freak?"""
3219,<|emo_disgust|> This sub is getting extremely obsessed. People just have a thing for weirdos who think they know everything.
3221,"<|emo_disgust|> This is so disgusting, but also so very good to know [NAME] is still alive."
3222,<|emo_disgust|> What the hell?! -[NAME]
3226,<|emo_disgust|> People on reddit are fucking repulsive
3228,"<|emo_disgust|> So you came here to defend the indefensible, guess what? You're fucking disgusting "
3229,<|emo_disgust|> When did I ever say that [NAME] is dumb
3230,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't know how other people can't read ""my wife has abeard"" and ""I'm a man and can do this"" and ""I have abeard"" and ""no one is going to know what I'm talking about until today"" into the same sentence."
3231,<|emo_disgust|> I'm really fucking bad at this 😂
3232,"<|emo_disgust|> No, they’re scared. They’re terrified of an actual human being doing what’s exactly what they want to do. I’m sorry if this made you feel any less, but...fuck off."
3233,<|emo_disgust|> In that case... HAVE YOU NOT SEEN A GOD SENDING IN THE AWAY?
3235,"<|emo_disgust|> It's so disgusting how government is using science and reason to justify their programs, and yet these same individuals are blind to the fact that these programs are hurting people"
3236,<|emo_disgust|> Those are some fucking huge welts...
3238,<|emo_disgust|> You are disgusted with God's Word and will quickly agree to any argument that does away with it.
3239,<|emo_disgust|> Your sister is a monster!!
3240,<|emo_disgust|> i was left feeling kind of insulted by her reaction
3241,"<|emo_disgust|> She doesn't even have to say what the ""Duff City den mother"" line is.... its plain as day."
3242,<|emo_disgust|> This picture was taken outside a bar in Liverpool city center. The alcohol was strong. Fucking rape and murder.
3243,<|emo_disgust|> Whoops I misread your comment. Let's try the next best thing!
3244,<|emo_disgust|> It was so goddamn creepy. No words. Even her voice was weird. I’d give anything to just see her voice again
3245,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I hate reddit.
3246,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I don't have to hear a word about [your] vile ways until you're on my fucking subreddit."" Get your shit together, mod. "
3247,<|emo_disgust|> This doesn't make any sense. [NAME] is actually a terrible commentator.
3248,<|emo_disgust|> They made me think I was going to vomit.
3249,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm here for the story, not the cringe."
3252,<|emo_disgust|> It really sucks that the majority of this subs audience is made up of kids
3253,"<|emo_disgust|> The least offensive suggestion I can think of is to call them ""bitches."" You don't have to shame them!"
3254,"<|emo_disgust|> You are a disgusting, abysmal human being."
3255,"<|emo_disgust|> No, he does not. You're a terrible person and that sucks. But at least you admit it."
3256,<|emo_disgust|> It's even worse having the same opinion expressed while being disgusting
3257,<|emo_disgust|> I don't like wearing swim trunks to a competition
3258,"<|emo_disgust|> That would be the worst possible outcome, I am so sorry thats even possible!"
3259,<|emo_disgust|> The only good thing to come out of this is the fact that it is on the internet
3260,<|emo_disgust|> That's a nice-looking suit.
3262,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing about this is the kid is a year old. That's pretty cringe
3263,<|emo_disgust|> That is so disgusting. The only good thing to come from this is that the woman being accused is now married (sadly).
3264,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not crying... you're laughing
3266,<|emo_disgust|> Weird. I could never do that though lol
3267,<|emo_disgust|> Well he was just awful today
3268,<|emo_disgust|> > but you are in the wrong subreddit. You haven’t bothered to read the rules.
3269,"<|emo_disgust|> If it's not broke, don't fix it!"
3270,"<|emo_disgust|> That's a bad one to hear, because it's usually true. "
3271,"<|emo_disgust|> He probably thought it was hilarious. Didn’t really care, though. He’s good at what he does now."
3272,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Lazy bastards"""
3273,<|emo_disgust|> What a cuck!
3274,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is worst defender he's ever been atleast, I'm shocked he didn't get better"
3275,<|emo_disgust|> He is the worst coach in bulls history
3277,<|emo_disgust|> I feel a little bad and a lot worse for whoever made this.
3278,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, god [NAME]..."
3279,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] here, the lefties are furious. Not that they have any more of a voice than the far right."
3280,<|emo_disgust|> Now this is creepy
3281,<|emo_disgust|> The worst part is I can’t remember ever having so much fun as while Lumpy is mad.
3282,<|emo_disgust|> Because they're wrong.
3284,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], what a fucking moron."
3285,<|emo_disgust|> Well that sucks.
3286,<|emo_disgust|> He’s evil
3287,"<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting... Im with you. As a vegan, that disgusted me."
3288,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is having a friend in a place that you are putting an immense amount of effort to get removed from.
3289,<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck did I just read?
3291,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst meme format in the history of meme formats.
3292,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird to be eating dinner at home alone while these comments are being made.
3293,<|emo_disgust|> The guy fiths
3294,<|emo_disgust|> And yet that's just wrong. People’s days off aren’t enough if they’re sick
3296,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]. It’s hard to be negative in that situation.
3297,<|emo_disgust|> He looks like [NAME].
3298,<|emo_disgust|> I’m a girl. I can’t stand [NAME] in sight.
3300,<|emo_disgust|> Damn straight.
3301,<|emo_disgust|> You're racist.
3303,<|emo_disgust|> But I have a feeling you might have a worse case of hangovers than I do.
3304,"<|emo_disgust|> He is an awful skater, poor dude "
3305,<|emo_disgust|> You dirty abo
3306,"<|emo_disgust|> She didn't just lie about her age, she actively lied that it's not uncommon for teenagers to lie about their age. It's pretty disturbing. "
3307,"<|emo_disgust|> This feels like one of those fake news shops where you have to click a button first. Yes, it is fake news."
3308,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, and it’s weird to be related to people on Reddit."
3309,<|emo_disgust|> This is the only time I’ve ever seen [NAME] in a bad light. He’s a good actor.
3310,<|emo_disgust|> So you are a liar and a bully. Bullies are liars and cheaters.
3311,<|emo_disgust|> I thought I was the only one that enjoyed the show but damn....
3313,<|emo_disgust|> That's so weird to hear since their is plenty of video of them doing weird things
3314,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] IS WHY I LIVE IN MOUNTAIN ISLAND?
3315,"<|emo_disgust|> Omg, hate how much I love it!"
3316,<|emo_disgust|> i feel that we need to be more conscious of how we are supporting each other so
3317,"<|emo_disgust|> If he's not married he's cheating, plain and simple"
3318,<|emo_disgust|> They made [NAME] into a laughing stock in the past. Not saying their version of events were better.
3319,<|emo_disgust|> That's not even true. I don't think they pay for the tip. I think they tip their workers well.
3320,<|emo_disgust|> i didnt feel rushed
3321,<|emo_disgust|> > Is it weird that I actually like [NAME] but hate [NAME]? Oh man
3322,<|emo_disgust|> No man I have never seen a woman screaming that she was beaten up and her rapist wasn't even arrested.
3323,<|emo_disgust|> I'm just a bit disturbed that he's also a bit racist
3324,"<|emo_disgust|> She was also charged with attempted murder, a charge that was dropped by a judge. "
3325,<|emo_disgust|> They’re all just so money hungry
3326,<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry for your loss; this story is heartwarming. I'm Sending you mysincere condolences.
3327,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not sure what to make of it all. I think it's funny how the media ignored all of this... from the start.
3328,<|emo_disgust|> This joke is just as bad as the [NAME] one
3329,"<|emo_disgust|> Now you're saying the same thing about them being on the show, just in a more sarcastic form!"
3331,<|emo_disgust|> The only comment I can think of that sounds racist is [NAME]
3332,"<|emo_disgust|> This is terrible, and it’s gotten way worse since herO era started. It’s just not..."
3333,"<|emo_disgust|> If he doesn’t sign this for him, let him know!!! Its just petty and stupid now!!!"
3334,<|emo_disgust|> If you are offended that I am not offended ask yourself why you are offended.
3335,<|emo_disgust|> Omg no way that’s beyond fucking creepy
3336,<|emo_disgust|> That was so horrible defending what the hell
3337,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck that.
3338,"<|emo_disgust|> > It also implies that the US can only accept permanent residents. True, but the immigration system would still fail utterly."
3341,<|emo_disgust|> He wasn't sorry for saying this at 2am. That man's heart must have Been melted a long time ago.
3342,<|emo_disgust|> This guy is one of the worst I've ever seen.
3343,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has to be the most worthless phantom thief changeup in the history of the game
3344,<|emo_disgust|> They also blame him for the loss of their jobs (informed by the owner of the club)
3345,<|emo_disgust|> They have a point. It's a weird thing to worry about on these sub reddits
3346,<|emo_disgust|> I'm so jealous as to have two cats now!
3347,<|emo_disgust|> People are so dumb. They think they're so intelligent just because someone posted a picture of them on Reddit.
3350,<|emo_disgust|> So you are quite the romantic...
3351,<|emo_disgust|> He would be appalled at this
3352,<|emo_disgust|> Man he must really hate us here in Australia.
3353,<|emo_disgust|> This is one of the worst I've seen. The other one had more context but it still stung
3354,"<|emo_disgust|> Well I did enjoy the first two, but damn..."
3355,<|emo_disgust|> This is a fucking hot pic.
3356,<|emo_disgust|> What? Why would anyone lie about something like that? I've rejected them all.
3358,"<|emo_disgust|> You'll never match her looks. That's her entire selling point. She'll scream, ""I'm gorgeous!"""
3359,<|emo_disgust|> Oh I hate him even more now. into a giant balls deep within my chest.
3361,<|emo_disgust|> I had the opposite experience but there's still no way around it... :(
3362,<|emo_disgust|> That is incredibly creepy and weird. An older/more experienced person would just assume that was due to age.
3363,<|emo_disgust|> i was sitting in front of the TV in the back yard when a car came barreling towards me and the TV started burning suddenly the picture got fuzzy or became black the first words out of my mouth were i didnt want to hurt you
3364,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is when a partner of yours says *oh no you heard about my cheating*
3365,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] wept.
3366,<|emo_disgust|> If he says he wanted to see an abortion because his mother told him it was bad... okay then. Thanks for the details bud.
3367,<|emo_disgust|> He’s a moron.
3368,"<|emo_disgust|> They hated him, because they didn’t know any of it."
3369,<|emo_disgust|> I hate to be the bearer of bad news but apparently she is expecting a child...
3370,<|emo_disgust|> Damn. I feel you.
3371,<|emo_disgust|> That poor janitor. janitor get out of here with that mess.
3372,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst thing I've ever seen. Take your upvote.
3373,<|emo_disgust|> And who knows how old he is. Maybe just takes off his wig and gives it a spritz of conditioner.
3374,<|emo_disgust|> Oh so it's [NAME] and his dog? Surprised Reddit doesn't link to a business card attachment
3375,"<|emo_disgust|> No need to apologize. Some [NAME], especially on your channel is a bitch. I'm sorry for your poor efforts on the other hand. I hope things start getting better "
3377,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] fucking look at that body
3378,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm not sure what the problem is, but I can think of at least one. The video is creepy and obnoxious."
3379,<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck I wanted to hate [NAME] but seriously I can’t
3380,<|emo_disgust|> I hate everything about this.
3381,<|emo_disgust|> > It’s the most disgusting thing I’ve ever seen. You're disgusting.
3383,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not crying.. you're smiling!
3384,<|emo_disgust|> It’s hard to give a negative review when it’s actually a perfect review!
3385,<|emo_disgust|> I hate poetry
3386,<|emo_disgust|> Your life must be miserable. I'm glad you have someone who can listen to your miserable life story to comfort you.
3387,<|emo_disgust|> I'm so sorry 😔
3389,<|emo_disgust|> It could be worse. The government shutdown could force them to back off.
3390,"<|emo_disgust|> There were a million reasons to hate her, but her skin color was the one that bothered me."
3391,<|emo_disgust|> This is some of the worst passing I've ever seen.
3393,<|emo_disgust|> That’s just...ridiculous.
3394,<|emo_disgust|> It's a weird thing to say. (I did it last year in conversation.)
3395,<|emo_disgust|> Those high-end shoes are awful and don't even meet the standards of safety standards you mention. The customer service is terrible as well.
3396,<|emo_disgust|> People going on about how terrible you are while being completely ignorant about your own situation.
3397,"<|emo_disgust|> Omg no way, you're gonna be better with this! 🤮 "
3398,<|emo_disgust|> She has two choices. She can either run or be a pro-lifeist and continue to enjoy her comfortable comfortable life or she can be an anti-lifeist and embrace being a pro-lifeist! 🝊
3399,<|emo_disgust|> Not everyone is offended by sexualized terms like that. Some people just think your use of them is an insult.
3400,<|emo_disgust|> I find it really creepy how quickly they forgot about [NAME] and [NAME]....
3402,<|emo_disgust|> It's a shame people see a business as being corrupt when in reality it's being run fairly fair.
3403,<|emo_disgust|> Youre creepy
3405,<|emo_disgust|> I want a video of [NAME] throwing a shit ball at a moose.
3406,"<|emo_disgust|> The new model is so disgusting. First, it had plastic surgery. Second, it had the worst PR."
3407,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was horrible last night and I hate watching him. You know how much I love him in Stapleton?
3409,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] in jail for years for crimes he didn't commit. That's just horrible.
3411,<|emo_disgust|> You’re calling for genocide
3412,<|emo_disgust|> This is the third time I've posted about this. It's infuriating.
3415,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I'm so sorry that you had that experience. I hope you have moved on.
3416,<|emo_disgust|> This is so sad. Can't imagine it can get any worse.
3417,<|emo_disgust|> Well there you go I'd say I can take a joke but that was quite an awful posting.
3418,<|emo_disgust|> Your age difference is extremely creepy.
3419,<|emo_disgust|> Now this is cringe
3420,<|emo_disgust|> You're a terrible person.
3421,"<|emo_disgust|> My girlfriend said to me one day ""I wonder how much you'll pay me for this."" I am dumbstruck"
3422,<|emo_disgust|> No hate TGR I think this is the first post from a long time I've been here so it really does suck I hate the way reddit treats its readers
3423,<|emo_disgust|> You and your legion of sexual perverts won't be getting much sleep tonight. until they decide to get in touch with [NAME]
3424,"<|emo_disgust|> I thought it was a cake, not a shit cake. What a ridiculous straw man defense. Gotta pay attention to what [NAME] does (on repeat)."
3425,<|emo_disgust|> > And you're saying that doesn't make you a racist. What a fucking ruse you're using.
3427,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn it, I never thought about this having grown up in America."
3428,<|emo_disgust|> So you're in for a world of hurt when you decide to side with them.
3429,<|emo_disgust|> Just because you don't like or agree with certain things doesn't mean you're racist.
3430,<|emo_disgust|> It’s the worst. I’m so sorry.
3431,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, I wish he were that boring "
3432,<|emo_disgust|> I’m weirdly aroused by satan
3433,<|emo_disgust|> I'm so sorry to read such a horrid thing.
3434,<|emo_disgust|> Lol okay. Thanks for saying your dumbass
3435,<|emo_disgust|> You're too ugly to bully. Bullies only make them worse.
3436,<|emo_disgust|> Damn she is a bimbo.
3438,<|emo_disgust|> My fucking head!
3439,<|emo_disgust|> We are a very selfish and insecure species.
3440,<|emo_disgust|> I was so confused when they said all the [NAME] characters were dead.
3441,<|emo_disgust|> I am shocked Reddit does this. Because it's so brazen.
3442,<|emo_disgust|> Not even smart people can not understand how this is stupid
3443,<|emo_disgust|> I’m fucking starving now😫
3444,<|emo_disgust|> Lol you're creepy
3445,"<|emo_disgust|> That's such a selfish mentality to have, to assume that everyone is gonna leave you when you are 40 and expect them to wait ages."
3447,<|emo_disgust|> This comment was deleted for breaking rule #6. Sorry for the confusion.
3448,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I don't care, just get off already."""
3449,<|emo_disgust|> We have a problem.
3450,"<|emo_disgust|> This is so disgusting. And yet, we continue to give them food stamps. Remarkable."
3451,<|emo_disgust|> This is horrible. People on Reddit are trying to understand why this happened but it just makes things even worse.
3452,"<|emo_disgust|> ""F*ck these calls, [NAME]!"""
3453,<|emo_disgust|> That was horrible defending what the hell
3454,<|emo_disgust|> This is so awful. So bad that I literally don't know what to say. Your creative genius is erasing all memory of those awful things.
3457,<|emo_disgust|> That's your take omg lol. You're disgusting.
3458,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh come on, stop saying yuck, it's a matter of fact thing. "
3459,"<|emo_disgust|> I like the potential of leprosy to turn into HIV, it's horrifying."
3460,<|emo_disgust|> i do feel a litte bit tortured by this point
3461,<|emo_disgust|> This is pretty worrying.
3462,<|emo_disgust|> In less than 24 hours Reddit can become the dominant media source of the internet. Sad.
3463,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting. One of the scariest things I've seen in a while.
3464,<|emo_disgust|> The way they wrote their letters inks were horrible. My drool instantly fell out of my mouth when they noticed that.
3465,"<|emo_disgust|> I think of all the disgusting things I have seen in my time as a pornstar, this is easily the grossest."
3466,<|emo_disgust|> This guy's been called out by his own team for calling out a fan not to be a Fuckenstar (his actual title)
3467,<|emo_disgust|> i feel incredibly sarcastic and petty right now
3468,<|emo_disgust|> He’s a horrible human being.
3469,<|emo_disgust|> i just feel disgusted by my own selfishness
3470,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh wow, your mom is really out there, huh?"
3472,<|emo_disgust|> Lol I think I love you when you swear.
3473,<|emo_disgust|> How dare he disrespect [NAME] with his ignorance and arrogance
3474,<|emo_disgust|> This is the saddest thing I've seen today
3475,<|emo_disgust|> That's so disgusting and the moms deserve what they get for their horrible daughters.
3477,<|emo_disgust|> This is actually really creepy. Makes me want to go into an abandoned minefield with a rifle.
3478,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn it, I need to find this... "
3479,<|emo_disgust|> What a disgusting person [NAME] is
3480,<|emo_disgust|> I would have thrown out a careers first and then called it a day but no. This guy would have been fired within hours.
3481,<|emo_disgust|> It's the worst when it's something I've said myself I think it most strongly when it's said to someone who I genuinely hate 
3482,<|emo_disgust|> How dare they ask him to be a good boy!
3483,<|emo_disgust|> You're right and I hate it.
3484,<|emo_disgust|> The fuck? I've never heard of this before? I swear it's awful.
3485,<|emo_disgust|> But she's a horrible liar and the worst of the bunch if you have no sense of irony at all.
3487,"<|emo_disgust|> I have one of those, but I have it in a really bad way :D"
3488,<|emo_disgust|> What the hell is that horrifying picture
3489,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, I hope that this was aonesight because then [NAME] would be totally convinced that we are all together against him."
3490,<|emo_disgust|> This is the biggest ripoff of a food brand I’ve ever seen
3491,"<|emo_disgust|> The only ""pro choice"" that would be rejected here is to abortion. What a load of old shite."
3492,"<|emo_disgust|> What's it matter how much of a jerk he is to call a woman a ""bitch""? He's a grown man. Stop being immature and grow up."
3493,<|emo_disgust|> What a sad argument.
3494,<|emo_disgust|> This is the first I’m hearing of it being fake. Very disturbing.
3495,"<|emo_disgust|> I'd give up entirely too easy, but it's still almost a surefire way to fuck up my health."
3498,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a very fine defender but he is horrible in this position.
3499,<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry if you made a bad choice but I had to play my PS2 in non- UE4 mode.
3500,<|emo_disgust|> The only bad thing about this is [NAME] is that he's a racist and wants to turn America into a concentration camp.
3502,<|emo_disgust|> Shut up [NAME]
3503,<|emo_disgust|> That comment was fucking repulsive.
3504,<|emo_disgust|> I’m sorry what you are going through but [NAME] has helped a lot of people up there in the [NAME] family tree. It can get very tiring actually.
3505,<|emo_disgust|> I think I've seen this comment a half dozen times. It's like the worst kind of meme.
3506,<|emo_disgust|> Oh wow that couple was creeps
3507,<|emo_disgust|> That was so disgusting. VWP.
3508,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, I saw the same thing! I'm so sorry that mine is that bad too"
3509,<|emo_disgust|> You need to find your own. Be contented even if that contentment is temporary. It's not a lifestyle.
3512,<|emo_disgust|> Oh there goes the whole neighborhood.
3513,<|emo_disgust|> It could be satire. Take your pick. Bad satire... or actual bad satire.
3514,"<|emo_disgust|> But, we did wrong things... and now...we are punished for them."
3515,<|emo_disgust|> The world is a cruel place.
3516,<|emo_disgust|> The lack of a backstop is amazing.
3517,<|emo_disgust|> Well that sucks and I’m so sorry for your loss. Stay strong! : )
3519,<|emo_disgust|> I thought they were being sarcastic
3520,"<|emo_disgust|> > because [NAME] looks better on tv than [NAME] I see both, so what"
3522,<|emo_disgust|> That’s awful. I hope you’re doing better.
3523,"<|emo_disgust|> This isn't ""calling your mother out on something you don't like"" it's calling her out on something that's just as bad, if not worse..."
3524,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] you people are fucking disgusting.
3525,"<|emo_disgust|> The worst of the bunch is probably the Amazon ""pearl edition"" which is just a plug for the physical copy."
3527,<|emo_disgust|> That's the opposite of a bad thing
3528,<|emo_disgust|> That's bad... I wish I could buy the game but I don't want to support Curse.
3529,<|emo_disgust|> Thats disgusting! The government should do more to help the small business owners as well
3530,<|emo_disgust|> That’s a terrible take. I’m sorry you had that experience. I hope you’re doing better now.
3531,<|emo_disgust|> You are ugly
3532,<|emo_disgust|> What a stupid and childish thing to say.
3533,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Nah, not marriage."""
3534,<|emo_disgust|> Now that’s wild. Those people sure do tend to be...sick.
3535,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] the monster!!!
3537,"<|emo_disgust|> I hate that you think this, but it's true."
3538,"<|emo_disgust|> It's like she didn't read your comment then thought ""fuck it, I'm not going to deal with this anymore""..."
3539,<|emo_disgust|> Don't be an asshole
3540,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] just went 1/10 as bad as [NAME] did in Dallas
3541,<|emo_disgust|> Your mom is horrible
3542,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah. He may have been a very dangerous man.
3543,"<|emo_disgust|> ""IT'S CANCER"" YOU IDIOT!!!!"
3544,"<|emo_disgust|> Those videos are definitely hate bait and a prime example [of] people being extremely cynical and cynical and hateful in all other aspects of their lives, while being part of a group"
3545,<|emo_disgust|> It'll hurt you
3546,<|emo_disgust|> That game traumatized me the first time I played it.
3547,"<|emo_disgust|> We do whatever the hell we want in thatched roof, thats how we got our shit together with the Vikings."
3548,<|emo_disgust|> This is just one way he's a moron and an excuse for our fucked up culture
3549,<|emo_disgust|> i didnt feel like the woman was too hostile
3551,<|emo_disgust|> I dont swallow toothpaste idiot. Why the hell would i want a toothpaste idiot you dit lazy shit
3553,<|emo_disgust|> The only bad thing about this is I’m so tired I’m shaking and crying
3554,<|emo_disgust|> Who is going to ask you to sign something without reading it?
3555,<|emo_disgust|> Because it's a horribly effective way to identify and shame vulnerable groups
3556,<|emo_disgust|> i dont wanna be rude for everyone but im feeling pretty spiteful and self indulgent lately
3557,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck no they got paid $14 an hour!!!
3558,<|emo_disgust|> There's a difference between being racist and not ever being sorry for racism.
3559,"<|emo_disgust|> Holy cow that was dirty, that hostess should be embarrassed and fired. He had such an air of finality about him, it’s disgusting. "
3560,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a FUCKING DIN!!!
3561,<|emo_disgust|> And the fact that he's the owner of the team that humiliated him gives him even more power now.
3562,<|emo_disgust|> There are racists everywhere.
3563,<|emo_disgust|> I wonder what that feels like
3564,<|emo_disgust|> She might accidentally be a botanist but she's not a botanist at all.
3565,<|emo_disgust|> Well it just so happened that mine was about to catch fire. I rushed in and helped put out the light but it still ruined the inside of my mouth.
3566,<|emo_disgust|> Damn it you!
3567,<|emo_disgust|> I'm just not that into supernatural horror.
3569,<|emo_disgust|> She reminds me of Ginger from Ginger Snaps! Ginger Snaps is my fave. She’s like Ginger Snaps but with ripped clothes! 😂
3570,<|emo_disgust|> That’s awful. What a horrible thing to say.
3571,<|emo_disgust|> You are fucking retarded
3573,"<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I would have done the same. I'm so sorry. They're good people, you guys. Don't ever ever date assholes. "
3575,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, [NAME] actually has a weird sense of humor. "
3576,"<|emo_disgust|> In the words of the late greats: ""the most important band in the world lost a great favorite""."
3577,<|emo_disgust|> This is the most violent video I've ever seen on Reddit. Not even exaggerating the brutality.
3579,<|emo_disgust|> i feel rude for saying all that
3580,"<|emo_disgust|> It’s really hard to look at, honestly. Some people think it’s a cakewalk to get on and others think it’s totally mind blowing (ie, horrifying).."
3581,<|emo_disgust|> That is one hell of a hot take lol. Good job though
3582,<|emo_disgust|> He should definitely lose it.
3584,<|emo_disgust|> You are not special because you were born into privilege.
3585,<|emo_disgust|> This is so brutal. I can do this.
3587,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] just has this weird thing that people love how he sounds
3588,"<|emo_disgust|> They're probably right to be concerned. It's a little weird to think about moving your entire social network onto another website, but it's more than a little paranoid to think about that..."
3589,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing keeping him warm is his own sweat.
3590,<|emo_disgust|> We don't live in a society where you can be too opinionated or critical without being called a troll and a racist.
3592,<|emo_disgust|> i feel that is a little petty in a world where our government is so over burdened they are willing to ignore anything that does not toe their line
3593,"<|emo_disgust|> We're a country by definition, and the people that hate that definition aren't the ones that should be complaining"
3594,<|emo_disgust|> That’s disgusting. I’m so sorry that you’re suffering. You’re loved.
3595,<|emo_disgust|> The fact her bed is still turned on despite the heat is horrible.
3597,<|emo_disgust|> That's really disgusting. You're disgusting. Stay inside and face that ugly ass picture.
3598,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm not really a [NAME], but I'm glad he's okay."
3599,<|emo_disgust|> You must suck at dating.
3601,<|emo_disgust|> This is very worrying. Is this the new normal? Can't stand being told that I'm wrong but still I feel like there are some fucked up people out there who will tell you they're normal just because they say the same thing
3602,<|emo_disgust|> It's just a dumb meme.
3603,"<|emo_disgust|> When she tried to call after she found out, the woman was obviously extremely unpleasant."
3604,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking idiotic thing to say lol.
3605,<|emo_disgust|> I hate that my ex and I have the same birthday.
3606,"<|emo_disgust|> No, those are not cheap sweats. They're made from polyester."
3607,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, I know a couple of people who have and it's awful."
3608,<|emo_disgust|> The carpool part killed me. The stop sign part was pretty bad.
3609,<|emo_disgust|> i was having a very bad fever last night after being away for a very long period of time from school most of my friends and family were away for the weekend so i had an idea of feeling a little grouchy that i wasn t getting enough sleep
3610,<|emo_disgust|> They're just so boring sometimes tbh.
3611,<|emo_disgust|> I think it's a very safe bet to expect a lot of awkward hugs and low-fives between the two of you.
3612,<|emo_disgust|> I've sat like all hell for four years straight wondering who the hell would come up with this.
3613,<|emo_disgust|> Your wife is disgusting.
3614,<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell thought he was dead
3615,<|emo_disgust|> I'm a woman and it feels weird saying that out loud.
3617,<|emo_disgust|> She needs to be a teacher and an activist and these people are really not.
3619,"<|emo_disgust|> My god, [NAME] this is so beautiful"
3621,<|emo_disgust|> They’re so creepy
3622,<|emo_disgust|> She hated him! She wanted him dead! She said it was all her fault!
3623,"<|emo_disgust|> Sooooo many people are. The ""outsider rich"" are definitely the weird ones!"
3624,"<|emo_disgust|> You should've said it differently though. This is a place that treats the worst of the worst, and we're supporting them"
3626,<|emo_disgust|> I’m sorry but seriously?
3627,<|emo_disgust|> They should go to a septic system instead of a sewage dump
3628,<|emo_disgust|> This is just disgusting.
3629,<|emo_disgust|> You're right and I hate it
3630,"<|emo_disgust|> And by that I mean, if you happen to find one, it would probably be the worst one you've seen."
3632,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I miss the south
3633,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I’m hungry now
3634,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you say that about [NAME].
3636,<|emo_disgust|> I mean I’m not even that impressed with [NAME] there and he’s already pissed about being treated worse than everyone lol.
3637,"<|emo_disgust|> He’s actually a weirdo, and he’s probably one of the top 4 or 5 most obnoxious people out there."
3638,"<|emo_disgust|> But in any case, I fucking hate this."
3639,<|emo_disgust|> They wanted our best player to be a center and all this empty handed effort is making me question the whole thing
3640,"<|emo_disgust|> Worst case scenario, he's worse than [NAME]"
3642,<|emo_disgust|> No that is disgusting
3643,<|emo_disgust|> That shit was so preposterous.
3645,<|emo_disgust|> You're on of those people I'm gonna kick you in the balls.
3647,<|emo_disgust|> I'm so jealous!
3648,<|emo_disgust|> It happened to me a few weeks ago.. I couldn’t remember the dude’s name at the time.. :(
3649,<|emo_disgust|> If this had happened to me then this conversation would still be ongoing. Im in my late 30's
3651,"<|emo_disgust|> >and the ones with you on it, you can barely hear it. That's awful, that mix is awful."
3653,<|emo_disgust|> I'm a guy and it made me cringe just looking at it
3654,"<|emo_disgust|> It was also one of the top stories on Reddit this week, which is strange."
3655,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] that was so terrible, she may very well have been one of the worst announcers I've ever heard."
3656,<|emo_disgust|> i was feeling quite frustrated when i first got there and then when you said you did this for both boys i thought something wonderful had happened
3657,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck that guy for trying to buy a gun here.
3658,<|emo_disgust|> It seems to me most men would rather fuck and look than fight.
3659,<|emo_disgust|> You don't call your own mom if she doesn't give you hugs. You're a asshole.
3660,"<|emo_disgust|> It's so stupid - [NAME] used to say it was ""mind blowing"" that they still keep it going."
3661,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking hooo
3662,<|emo_disgust|> That’s what I’m shocked they got away with. I’ll be shocked to learn [NAME] won.
3663,<|emo_disgust|> Your a fucking idiot lol at this point
3664,<|emo_disgust|> This is a horrible take.
3665,<|emo_disgust|> This is a great example of the worst of [NAME] propaganda.
3667,<|emo_disgust|> That’s a brutal take. I don’t call him [NAME] just because of his hair...he has a fucking chinlock.
3668,<|emo_disgust|> I get your pain and disgust. Not the same.
3669,<|emo_disgust|> This is actually incredible
3671,<|emo_disgust|> The saddest part is that she thinks young men find her attractive.
3672,<|emo_disgust|> It has nothing to do with being attractive. It can make me feel unattractive. What is your point?
3674,<|emo_disgust|> i feel a little disgusted that i could take in so much garbage
3675,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds dreadful. What's your experience been like? Any plans to start a Googling club if you find any?
3676,<|emo_disgust|> This is the same guy who posted the above about why he's not a vegan. It was a hate sub.
3678,<|emo_disgust|> I mean it's weird but also veryills way better
3679,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds so terrible. I'm so sorry for your loss!
3680,<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry I imagine that was devastating.
3681,<|emo_disgust|> Oh no he didn't!
3682,<|emo_disgust|> i think most people are feeling an awful lot more hateful of themselves than i was at that time
3683,<|emo_disgust|> But people still complain about traffic.
3684,<|emo_disgust|> That's the worstest possible outcome
3685,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck that smug ass marketing wanker
3686,"<|emo_disgust|> >You're a sad person. Well, sorry."
3688,<|emo_disgust|> The internet never ceases to surprise
3689,"<|emo_disgust|> I think it's a terrible idea. We are already supporting 20,000+ illegal immigrants and yet we are against illegal immigrants."
3691,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh no. She’s in the wrong for that, however."
3692,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a cancer in our society.ban him from our streets, tv shows and movieshe should never see the light of day"
3695,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, what a fuckin n"
3696,<|emo_disgust|> Not a single one of them has ever worked in a bank. They're mostly just crooks.
3697,<|emo_disgust|> I'm with ya! The last episode left me wanting more but not convinced by the ending. I might be missing something
3698,<|emo_disgust|> i just feel very dissatisfied
3699,<|emo_disgust|> I've done that. I've walked on eggshells
3700,<|emo_disgust|> I think the most ridiculous thing is he said this in May. It's been a weird year
3701,<|emo_disgust|> What a moron.
3702,"<|emo_disgust|> If she actually does it, how dare she not know how to use a gun...."
3704,"<|emo_disgust|> No, not his, your dad's."
3705,<|emo_disgust|> I hate people like this
3706,"<|emo_disgust|> The thing is, he’s just a guy. What a profile"
3707,<|emo_disgust|> i feel very bitter
3708,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is getting some serious love in DC. Really look at the relationship he has with [NAME]. That is some strong meat
3709,<|emo_disgust|> She is using him for her own gain. How disgusting.
3710,<|emo_disgust|> Just got that as someone else had already said it.. sorry about my english but I’m pretty useless at this
3711,<|emo_disgust|> This sounds so terrible. Are you with park services or the media? I think this is a horrible idea.
3712,"<|emo_disgust|> We will not be bullied into a voting booth by a group of angry, intolerant, racist, homophobic, isolationist, gun-loving, anti-intellectual, anti-science, anti-freedom, anti-free Thought, anti-libertarian, and anti-science morons. "
3713,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you describe my experience as anything but incredibly disgusting?? R1
3714,"<|emo_disgust|> ""You're gross"""
3715,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] that was so awful... I thought it was funny...
3716,<|emo_disgust|> So your boyfriend is a psychopath. Cool bruh
3717,<|emo_disgust|> Who’s angry at the paddy wagons
3718,<|emo_disgust|> The [NAME] is bad
3719,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm not ashamed of you for being raised by a single mom, that's just how I was. "
3720,<|emo_disgust|> This is horribly disgusting. It really isn't that hard to understand.
3721,<|emo_disgust|> He's in love with himself
3725,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] the best dad.
3726,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fucking asshole. I'd rather have her as our OC than [NAME]
3727,"<|emo_disgust|> It doesn't surprise me to hear that. He's a petty, insecure and vain prick."
3728,<|emo_disgust|> Just because [NAME] is getting these hate comments doesn’t mean he’s actually a bad president or something
3729,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is running out of generic medicine
3730,<|emo_disgust|> It's as if everyone hates us because we don't have any neighbors. It's insane.
3731,<|emo_disgust|> My husband has had sleep paralysis twice and I'm terrified and praying for him.
3732,"<|emo_disgust|> Not only does it sound disgusting, but she also sounds stupid."
3733,"<|emo_disgust|> It's called a 2-letter FYI, it's so weird I've never even heard of it. "
3734,"<|emo_disgust|> I mean it's awful, but at least it wasn't worse than tsunami-level disaster."
3735,"<|emo_disgust|> That may be true, there is often a culture of silence surrounding sexual abuse."
3736,"<|emo_disgust|> They do, they really do. I've had enough of this bullshit. Stay away from my neighborhood, scum. "
3737,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is horrible, but he was better than this....the only change was [NAME]"
3738,<|emo_disgust|> i start feeling a bit mad
3739,<|emo_disgust|> I am very sorry. I hope you are doing better.
3740,<|emo_disgust|> This is not a comedy subreddit it is a subreddit devoted to the dumb and hilarious. If you are offended by the use of humor make your move.
3741,<|emo_disgust|> You do you?
3742,"<|emo_disgust|> So...yikes. I was going to comment that it was weird, but I guess we are just too used to that."
3743,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst I've ever seen
3744,<|emo_disgust|> She's a horrible person inside and out
3745,<|emo_disgust|> I like to think that this is why our elected officials and government are so bad at keeping promises.
3746,<|emo_disgust|> I know and that is what is most infuriating to me. People don’t take issue with the amount of hate they get over it but when it is done in such a disgusting manner it’s disgusting.
3747,<|emo_disgust|> That is beyond shockingly bad.
3748,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] just got his arms outstretched toward the sky like there was nothingous about the motion.
3749,<|emo_disgust|> This is just as bad as the original in that there's really no way around it..
3750,<|emo_disgust|> I like to say the n-word but I’m scared to do that in real life.
3751,"<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst, ugh."
3752,<|emo_disgust|> No. That's wrong
3753,<|emo_disgust|> Because it's creepy and weird
3754,<|emo_disgust|> What is scary? A small penis
3755,<|emo_disgust|> What. The. Fuck. Fuck.
3756,<|emo_disgust|> But she is! /s
3757,"<|emo_disgust|> Because the false accusation is so devastating and harasses people for years and years, it is almost impossible for her to get away. "
3758,<|emo_disgust|> What a sick post omg
3759,<|emo_disgust|> >and the rest are a fucking locaust
3760,"<|emo_disgust|> So, you literally grew up in a barn?"
3762,<|emo_disgust|> i had a feeling she was going to be a little apprehensive
3764,<|emo_disgust|> They were also the first team to give up all that gold for nothing in return. gold nagas.
3766,"<|emo_disgust|> I was really hoping to be wrong this time, but yeah [NAME] can do what [NAME] doesn't. Absolutely amazing"
3767,"<|emo_disgust|> Fuck it, I've got some butter."
3768,<|emo_disgust|> The worst: running around aimlessly while wearing rad suits
3769,<|emo_disgust|> Oh damn I got distracted by a vs
3770,<|emo_disgust|> The first letter of each state is always the same but the second letter is the weirdest
3771,<|emo_disgust|> How to: Stop being a fucking moron and call yourself a man
3772,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I'm not entirely sure the point you're trying to make is what I said. Well, I guess it is being against your mother."
3773,<|emo_disgust|> The worst. When [NAME] does that I cringe in my pants.
3774,<|emo_disgust|> It just didn’t work
3775,<|emo_disgust|> I hope to god they don't all die instantly instead have a fixed duration and you die first.
3776,<|emo_disgust|> Holy crap. I could have easily gone with this if the title weren't so weird
3779,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] just needs to stop saying that about himself.
3780,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, I didn’t catch that."
3782,<|emo_disgust|> Why the hell dont we just fucking kill him already!!!!!
3783,<|emo_disgust|> When a 4 year old boy told a 5 year old girl she was hot.
3784,<|emo_disgust|> What in the fuck was that
3785,<|emo_disgust|> When you are sick you need to know about your options before they list you next to another sick person who has just gone weeks without food
3786,<|emo_disgust|> The one with the giant hand is the worst
3787,"<|emo_disgust|> But anyway, the real horror of it all is their total lack of consideration of any sort of balance (or anything) in the game."
3788,<|emo_disgust|> There’s a reason why we play a 3-4 in college football...
3789,<|emo_disgust|> What a weird way to ask for help.
3791,<|emo_disgust|> Soooo [NAME] let’s find a new home [NAME]
3792,<|emo_disgust|> i was feeling very cold in the morning
3793,<|emo_disgust|> This is a horrible fix
3794,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking mean.
3796,"<|emo_disgust|> No, but we're terribleakers."
3797,<|emo_disgust|> That was the best power play I’ve ever seen
3798,<|emo_disgust|> It was pretty disgusting the way he was pressing the zapper into the ground
3799,"<|emo_disgust|> OHH the top comment of that thread is ""fuck these weak minded olds"""
3800,"<|emo_disgust|> No one is saying this is actually true, just that people on reddit are getting ridiculously gullible. "
3802,<|emo_disgust|> There is a reason why the Vikings are the 2nd most accurate team in the league at throwing the ball to WRs.
3803,"<|emo_disgust|> What an obnoxious, drunk girl. "
3804,<|emo_disgust|> I don't even like cold showers. It just makes me feel gross.
3806,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is an awful defender
3807,<|emo_disgust|> He is just awful enough to do that.
3808,<|emo_disgust|> That dude's really just mad because it's windy outside.
3809,"<|emo_disgust|> I didn't see the issue with putting it in the trash, it was such a nasty accident I felt it was just a matter of time before it hit the ground."
3810,<|emo_disgust|> This should be of concern to you. Don't share it. It's nothing. Stay away from the kids.
3811,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was one of the best pure goalkeepers in the country. The problems he has had at club level this season would be phenomenal if he wasn't such a shut down.
3812,<|emo_disgust|> It's also why I'm so disgusted at almost everything.
3814,<|emo_disgust|> But [NAME] isn't rich! It's [NAME]!
3815,<|emo_disgust|> There is something deeply wrong with your brain
3816,<|emo_disgust|> He fucking dunks over [NAME].
3817,<|emo_disgust|> Because [NAME] hates freedom
3818,<|emo_disgust|> I want to die
3819,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh no, my bad"
3820,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] why did i even try to respond? That sounds like my fault for not being online when he's been replying.
3821,"<|emo_disgust|> I was the same age we were that night. But yeah, it’s worse to be a dad with two daughters..."
3822,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is not looking good. I don’t understand it, but I think I’m going to start shoving food into his face as he talks. I’ll be suprised."
3823,<|emo_disgust|> i feel disgusted
3824,<|emo_disgust|> I thought it was a penis and an urethra. When are they gonna change that?
3825,<|emo_disgust|> Now THAT is a murder by words!
3826,<|emo_disgust|> I have one. It’s bad. Worst pain in my ass.
3827,<|emo_disgust|> Who wants that shit? I'm disgusted there.
3828,<|emo_disgust|> But that sucks. Now we just want a penis in our assholes. *scabs on our assholes*
3830,<|emo_disgust|> My favorite is when [NAME] looks at some of the trash on the subway cars and just gets all weirded out
3831,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, that's so true! I'm so sorry for your loss! Your mom/step-dad should be extremely prayerful, and that prayerfulness should be heard!"
3832,<|emo_disgust|> It was just so damn creepy.
3833,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that’s good
3834,<|emo_disgust|> Well that and the weather in general makes it a bit uncanny to be living in south Australia.
3836,<|emo_disgust|> Well that sucks. Glad it’s not just me who was also a bit salty.
3837,<|emo_disgust|> i got to feel very impatient just reading this
3838,<|emo_disgust|> They don’t even care what anyone says these days. Its all ‘drama’ to them.
3839,<|emo_disgust|> They did it just so they wouldn't get arrested. The irony is sad and disgusting.
3840,<|emo_disgust|> And he'd get mad at the other cops for the other cop being a fucking idiot for doing his job properly....
3841,<|emo_disgust|> Weird. I think it's safe to say [NAME] was more into the porn than these girls.
3842,<|emo_disgust|> The fact she's a celebrity means the least to me. [NAME] is worse
3843,"<|emo_disgust|> Why do all the animals look disgusting to you, [NAME]?"
3844,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, if you're a pro-lifeist and an anti-vaxxer then you're a weirdo."
3846,<|emo_disgust|> Those bastards lied and said he had been found not guilty. A fucking lie.
3847,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing about this is how calm everyone was. Everyone was just holding their breath while they tried to argue with this madman.
3849,<|emo_disgust|> He has a weird way of speaking.
3850,<|emo_disgust|> That's why it's illegal in the USA.
3851,<|emo_disgust|> This person should be outed to the world. I'm so disgusted that there is such a thing as safe places on the internet.
3852,<|emo_disgust|> What is scary?
3853,"<|emo_disgust|> I didn’t really think this was that bad a thing to say, seriously! It just seems so disgusting now."
3855,<|emo_disgust|> The irony is pretty sad honestly
3856,<|emo_disgust|> They’re all just horrible people but I love [NAME] and her friends 😂
3857,<|emo_disgust|> It seems you have no idea what fascism is.
3859,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating. I can't imagine people doing this to their family pets.
3860,<|emo_disgust|> I got you. I've been trying the other door. They all shut. They're all swarming the front door.
3861,<|emo_disgust|> This is so disgusting. No one should ever make light of child abuse.
3863,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]? I hate that name. I would be more than happy tovote for a female name change to [NAME].
3864,<|emo_disgust|> This person sounds a little insane.
3865,<|emo_disgust|> That’s what I heard and that’s a horrible take. I hate this world and’s people.
3866,"<|emo_disgust|> Shut up, [NAME]."
3867,"<|emo_disgust|> Now this is weird... there's a lot of posts on here about going outside on a Sunday afternoon and showering with a hotamp, sooo it did happen..."
3868,"<|emo_disgust|> When I put up the ""PTSD is a Fucking Verb"" poster, the first post that comes to mind is ""I have no idea what I'm talking about... Go get raped again, [NAME]"""
3869,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] this is terrible.
3870,<|emo_disgust|> I'd like to think he was joking. That poor slob.
3872,<|emo_disgust|> No I’m just stressed out about something
3873,<|emo_disgust|> i still think it strange how i feel and am often disgusted at the whole thing
3874,"<|emo_disgust|> Your company sucks, good luck out there bud."
3875,"<|emo_disgust|> It's a terrible thing to do, and it's worse when it's done with actual malice."
3877,"<|emo_disgust|> How is that a ""drug test"""
3879,<|emo_disgust|> So you said the same thing last week after I said it?
3880,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that's an ugly 2D art style :D
3882,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] can’t run at all
3884,<|emo_disgust|> I like the namesakes but the dude in that picture is O'Reilly.
3885,"<|emo_disgust|> I was like [NAME], oh [NAME], I needed this!"
3886,"<|emo_disgust|> No, it’s worse. How many children did [NAME] bring into the home?"
3887,<|emo_disgust|> So much irony and hypocrisy.
3888,"<|emo_disgust|> No actually, you don't have to do anything. Just enjoy your free time (if there is such a thing in existence, I am very interested in learning more about it)."
3889,<|emo_disgust|> Just because you're under 30 doesn't mean you won't fuck up. You're a terrible person.
3890,<|emo_disgust|> He was a very bad actor.
3891,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, I don't think we're wrong at all. Not with the offseason spending either."
3892,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you disrespect [NAME] by posting shit like this
3893,<|emo_disgust|> There's a weird sub for cheating.
3894,<|emo_disgust|> Because [NAME] is a creep as fuck
3895,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn it, I was wondering if this game was a thing in the west now."
3896,<|emo_disgust|> No way you're making any sense. Hate the city and everything just based on a few isolated cases.
3899,"<|emo_disgust|> >I don’t give a fuck about the temperature Oh my god, the fucking heat wave!"
3900,"<|emo_disgust|> When you hate someone because they did exactly what you did, that’s hating them. "
3901,<|emo_disgust|> This is almost like one of the worst Twitter accounts I've ever seen. This is just so infuriating
3902,<|emo_disgust|> I’m so sorry to hear about what your mom did to you. You can do THIS. Be strong. You can do this.
3904,<|emo_disgust|> There a lot of ugly cunts in this sub don't know what to say to this news
3905,<|emo_disgust|> Your character is so clearly a bad asso why the fuck didn’t you speak up?
3906,<|emo_disgust|> i feel that everyone on this planet is so fucked up i have a feeling that i ll never live a normal life
3907,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah suck it, Chicago."
3908,<|emo_disgust|> I don't find it all that surprising considering how much of a presence [NAME] has been on social media for the past few years.
3909,"<|emo_disgust|> That’s not an excuse. Bad football team, bad year, bad personality, bad karma, terrible team and bad luck."
3910,<|emo_disgust|> That's a Shame because that is such a gorgeous picture. I had my moments on that phone.
3911,<|emo_disgust|> If that's the case then he seems quite unethical.
3912,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking hell they're bringing on all the giants
3913,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck these calls
3914,"<|emo_disgust|> She definitely lost me, but i will never forget this video. It made me fall in love with OKC"
3915,<|emo_disgust|> And he's probably not as angry as he sometimes seems. He's not someone I'd want beating me up
3916,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling frustrated and angry but i just know i must not let it show
3917,<|emo_disgust|> It’s hard to look at. Especially when it’s so disgusting.
3918,<|emo_disgust|> And even worse after 40 years!
3920,<|emo_disgust|> >I'm sorry my friend hates me.
3921,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I feel like I'm one of those weirdos. I hate YouTube
3924,<|emo_disgust|> I am a very generous person and I can take one of any of those meals. Unfortunately I also have a lot of extra on the house.
3925,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, I think a lot of people in this thread are just totally insane and don't really understand how it really works. "
3927,<|emo_disgust|> And the best part is she'll probably become a partner of some of the guys she sucks at sex...so she can be bitter about it.
3928,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is horrible at his job but i’m glad he blamed an outside actor for the entire episode.
3929,<|emo_disgust|> When were they wrong for saying that? Wasn’t [NAME] at fault for saying they’re wrong to think that. FFWF
3930,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn, we need them both"
3931,"<|emo_disgust|> I would say he is a very manipulative and extremely dangerous man. If he ever tries to come home with you, there is an even greater chance he'll try to kill you."
3932,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is so damn creepy
3934,<|emo_disgust|> This fucking poster
3936,"<|emo_disgust|> You better be, otherwise they'd just ignore you."
3937,<|emo_disgust|> This is so sad. #playdespacito
3938,<|emo_disgust|> I thought you were better than this. Shame you're not
3939,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], the fucking worst."
3940,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, I hate how much I love [NAME] as a player. And honestly, I'm honestly surprised he's not the HC some of us here believe him to be"
3942,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, my husband isn’t old enough to remember how awesome we were at the YMCA Kids! Yay for us! "
3944,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a horrible Quarterback. His Relay is terrible.... I feel [NAME] lost.
3945,<|emo_disgust|> That was a bad pass to close out the game
3946,<|emo_disgust|> I am not shocked. I just wish our local elected official had been more forthright about saying this.
3948,<|emo_disgust|> How many times has that been said before?
3949,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, that poor janitor. "
3950,"<|emo_disgust|> Not a chance, and I'm happy for him!"
3951,<|emo_disgust|> Don’t use your company name in this thread I’m fucking starving
3954,<|emo_disgust|> It's like they were making a horror movie and didn't care who gets eaten
3956,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I can't believe [NAME] didn't get the jersey"" is a pretty fair and accurate description."
3957,<|emo_disgust|> It would actually be hard for anyone not already disgusted with Israel to not also have sympathies for the PLO.
3958,<|emo_disgust|> Damn it. That would be an impossible pass to make during a playoff game.
3959,<|emo_disgust|> Who a piece of shit.
3961,"<|emo_disgust|> But still, [NAME] is terrible"
3962,<|emo_disgust|> I'm with [NAME] we are blessed and our planet is fragile
3963,<|emo_disgust|> Well I don’t really know any but myself so all I can say is wow I would love for you to have a go at it ;)
3964,"<|emo_disgust|> When did you last check your credit score? I'd love to hear the exact amount, month and year"
3965,<|emo_disgust|> I think I see a mohawk.
3966,<|emo_disgust|> Worst summer ever :(
3967,<|emo_disgust|> The only bad thing about this is how much I enjoy it
3968,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, my [NAME] is gross"
3969,"<|emo_disgust|> Not true at all. ""Nag Da's"" are always the worst."
3970,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird how everyone feels the need to link to the exact same shithole.
3971,<|emo_disgust|> It wasn't. This is the weirdest thing I've seen today.
3972,<|emo_disgust|> This is so cruel. I literally feel physically sick.
3973,<|emo_disgust|> My only advice is that if you have an issue with her and she makes you feel bad for other women then that's something you will need to talk about with your partner.
3974,<|emo_disgust|> This is horrible and the owner is going to be extremely rich while this poor kid is going to beMAJOR in college debt.
3975,<|emo_disgust|> That’s just unprofessional. I’d rather have her lose to Florida than [NAME] doing that
3976,<|emo_disgust|> He’s a scumbag.
3977,<|emo_disgust|> He must really hate his job.
3978,<|emo_disgust|> There would have been a lot more public indecency in that area.
3979,<|emo_disgust|> Who does she think she is?
3980,"<|emo_disgust|> It's a horrible thing, I hate it so bad."
3982,"<|emo_disgust|> You're right, it really is the worst."
3983,"<|emo_disgust|> Just like the last war, our enemies will use our methods to further their own ends."
3985,<|emo_disgust|> Those men are disgusting.
3986,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh what an irony in disguise for people of color, because the U.S. has the highest rate of incarceration of any developed country"
3987,"<|emo_disgust|> This is not funny, this is disgusting."
3988,<|emo_disgust|> This just reminded me I need a nap.
3989,"<|emo_disgust|> So the reason that's great is because the olds complain about all the crap going on in today's society, while they're live their lives being obnoxiousholes. "
3990,<|emo_disgust|> It’s really interesting but also kinda scary. It isn’t “at all” antiSemitic
3991,<|emo_disgust|> I am an FTFY obnoxious [NAME]. I hate people who are *not* obnoxious
3992,<|emo_disgust|> Oh no the poor man
3994,"<|emo_disgust|> Those women who claim to hate on men because they're men are actually the worst. It's the worst of the worst, actually."
3996,<|emo_disgust|> The one with her face in the picture? Ugh I’d rather them both naked
3997,<|emo_disgust|> This is how you get women to fuck your face
3998,<|emo_disgust|> Those are some seriously ugly gym sweatshirts [NAME] <3
3999,<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting...and incontrolable for a certain age group.
4000,<|emo_disgust|> i was feeling really envious since the whole time i thought i might be catching a flight to an American city
4001,<|emo_disgust|> There is actually a law that makes it a crime to molest children in the eyes of a child. Although it's hard to imagine parents being that stupid.
4002,"<|emo_disgust|> But you're so right! I'm literally in tears right now, I have no words."
4004,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah the weird eyes.
4005,"<|emo_disgust|> ""SJW's"" hate for interracial couples is shockingly well documented"
4006,<|emo_disgust|> I dont know what happened but people in games now seem a lot more toxic.
4007,<|emo_disgust|> This is creepy and weird. Good riddance to awful rubbish.
4008,<|emo_disgust|> Why is it illegal?
4009,<|emo_disgust|> I don’t enjoy [NAME] and I don’t blame you for that. But don’t expect anything similar in the immediate future from the Sabres.
4010,<|emo_disgust|> This one is disgusting.
4013,"<|emo_disgust|> I’d like to know why that is, is it really hard to understand?"
4015,<|emo_disgust|> Damn. Those refs actually fucking hate us.
4016,<|emo_disgust|> Wow! I got your back!
4017,<|emo_disgust|> i just get pissed off and im not a guy
4018,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah fuck off already.
4019,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that she’s white is incredibly infuriating.
4020,<|emo_disgust|> The guy who just insulted me
4021,"<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell thought it was water, seriously. They need to get its head drained."
4022,<|emo_disgust|> The dude is seriously neurotic.
4023,"<|emo_disgust|> I mean no, he is not. "
4025,<|emo_disgust|> Well I guess all skinheads hate Ashtrays
4026,<|emo_disgust|> If you're saying it's a bad defense to lie when the truth is worse... what the hell are you talking about
4027,<|emo_disgust|> Don't you're making me paranoid man
4028,<|emo_disgust|> Damn these refs actually fucking hate us. This game is actually worse without [NAME] then it was without [NAME].
4030,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing about this is how many people don’t even realize this.
4031,"<|emo_disgust|> That couple that came to visit wanted their wedding cake, they said. But I'm $1500 and they want $2500"
4032,"<|emo_disgust|> That's not what this was about at all...she was just using this as an excuse to not let him have his cake and eat it, yep."
4033,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, [NAME] just came into my head. I can’t imagine writing this now."
4034,<|emo_disgust|> What a pathetic list
4035,<|emo_disgust|> But what will happen for people like you who actually had a job? What will you get for being rejected?
4036,<|emo_disgust|> What kind of response is that it's disgusting how your video only has 1k views
4037,<|emo_disgust|> You don't. You love to lie and manipulate people.
4040,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] this is horrible...
4041,<|emo_disgust|> So? You're a freak.
4042,<|emo_disgust|> She also happens to have an awful amount of online friends.
4045,<|emo_disgust|> Holy hell we are getting awful again.
4046,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. It's a terrible start. I'm really happy for you guys. Stay strong!
4047,"<|emo_disgust|> ""The longer you look the worse it gets."" Damn, right?"
4050,<|emo_disgust|> I don’t like being that girl and am glad he’s the boy I’m with.
4051,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is fucking destroying Bama's front 7
4052,<|emo_disgust|> That's the worst urinal ever.
4053,<|emo_disgust|> > Not being supportive of [NAME] to hate her as a result of her own sex? Wow.....
4055,<|emo_disgust|> Fuckin' science bitch
4058,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that’s a lot of blame to shift
4059,"<|emo_disgust|> And for those who have not seen them already that pic is shaky as hell but hey, good ForD car"
4060,<|emo_disgust|> Your parents must be assholes.
4063,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird how the same people who are scared of rape and sex work, also want to put profit over human dignity."
4064,<|emo_disgust|> This is so creepy and sad. Good riddance to awful rubbish.
4065,<|emo_disgust|> This is horribly disgusting. One of my 7-year old nephews just ate it. How are parents supposed to pickle their kids when they watch such trash?
4066,<|emo_disgust|> This is the stupidest thing I've seen today
4067,<|emo_disgust|> The fact [NAME] doesn't name him [NAME] is an amazing clue that he's a dirty player.
4068,<|emo_disgust|> I’m kinda sad I had to come this far down to find this.
4069,"<|emo_disgust|> What an uneducated, ignorant woman."
4070,<|emo_disgust|> But it looks fucking creepy
4071,<|emo_disgust|> Omg yes! She looks just like [NAME] fromG
4072,"<|emo_disgust|> I mean yeah, we got a shitpost about a month ago and people still use it..."
4073,<|emo_disgust|> I mean don't they have an easier time to qualify since we're in the midst of the offseason.
4074,<|emo_disgust|> It’s so weird how popularara is here. I hate how much I love it.
4075,<|emo_disgust|> It’s the worst when it’s something you actually do. Like when someone beats you like that with a belt
4076,<|emo_disgust|> Man I know a couple of people who are... [NAME] would be devastated
4077,<|emo_disgust|> She has one foot in the past (when she was first revealed) and the other one is still a bit shaky
4078,<|emo_disgust|> Weird how fast the internet finds these turd bastards
4079,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, I'm the same. There's no way I can stay away from it, I feel like I could eat it every day for weeks. "
4080,<|emo_disgust|> I'm appalled that you still care about your health and well-being despite this.
4081,<|emo_disgust|> I can't imagine not wanting to be a flight risk if I get a heart attack every day. I'm so heartless I owe it to myself not to anyone.
4082,"<|emo_disgust|> No matter how old you are, you’re still a kid. Maybe you’ll have lived your whole life thinking ‘oh that’s horrible’ but just don’t live it like that."
4084,<|emo_disgust|> I want my fucking cake back.
4085,<|emo_disgust|> And they all end up blaming [NAME] for all of them.
4086,<|emo_disgust|> It's even creepier to find out most of the state's population aren't even natural born.
4087,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] really hated [NAME] and his ideas.
4088,<|emo_disgust|> Worst radio ever.
4089,<|emo_disgust|> It’s gross that you’re comparing apples to oranges...
4090,<|emo_disgust|> This is weird.
4091,<|emo_disgust|> I swear these refs actually fucking hate us.
4092,<|emo_disgust|> A lot of my friends got shut down by their parents for similar reasons which kinda sucks cause those parents are probably awesome parents themselves.
4093,<|emo_disgust|> Damn we needed that layup
4094,<|emo_disgust|> Because you're a horrible person.
4095,<|emo_disgust|> That’s awful. You should call your mom and tell her to get the hell out. No one should be that stupid.
4096,<|emo_disgust|> Your friends have a worse track record than you do.
4099,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking cuck
4101,"<|emo_disgust|> There’s a difference between hate speech andactual hate.actual hate is what [NAME] is, and her words are disgusting. "
4102,<|emo_disgust|> I'd rather keep it open than close like that
4105,<|emo_disgust|> I feel personally attacked by [NAME]
4106,"<|emo_disgust|> Whoa I'm quite new to this, but I've noticed these same comments on some of my older posts. It must be good for me!"
4107,<|emo_disgust|> He was bad
4109,"<|emo_disgust|> No, it’s not. It’s creepy and weird but also quite good. What a weird thing to say. "
4111,<|emo_disgust|> What happened?
4112,<|emo_disgust|> You’re the one who should be ashamed
4113,<|emo_disgust|> That's weird.
4114,<|emo_disgust|> This shit is getting repulsive.
4116,<|emo_disgust|> We will never go back to the days of [NAME] when they were so hated they had their own slang.
4117,"<|emo_disgust|> The thing is, my dog is so conditioned to look at cats as disgusting as I am he won't do that. I can't imagine."
4118,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a terrible player but thats just his fault for not understanding the offense the snap was on
4119,"<|emo_disgust|> The only person who should not lose is her parents, she's rotten and needs to be Removed."
4120,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, [NAME] really is that bad with his neutral zone situations, it's like a bad acid trip"
4121,<|emo_disgust|> There’s a surprisingly large number of women in this sub who play games like this to keep their legs from degenerating to include a scrotum.
4123,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has his moments, but for the most part he's really boring as f"
4124,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is so over-the top and obnoxious in everything he does. I love him but this is so obnoxious too.
4126,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] that was so terrible
4128,<|emo_disgust|> Those sub-reddits. I've given them an especially hard time.
4129,<|emo_disgust|> I fucking hate this
4130,<|emo_disgust|> Weird game lol
4131,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is “calling your mom on your shitty behavior”
4132,<|emo_disgust|> I'm literally screaming.
4133,"<|emo_disgust|> The problem is, [NAME] is a very, very, very bad AND accurate analyst. "
4134,<|emo_disgust|> The fuck off.
4135,<|emo_disgust|> Not sure how the hell that's not a racist thing to do.
4136,<|emo_disgust|> This is pretty scary. From the kind of person that was responsible for 9/11 up here is a pretty scary indication that this is a movement with a lot of potential. Good luck and have fun
4137,<|emo_disgust|> You should go to emergency room.
4138,<|emo_disgust|> You don't deserve your due process rights if you've never even been charged with a crime.
4139,"<|emo_disgust|> It's an ugly 6-11 power program at best, and the Big East is pretty bad at worst "
4140,<|emo_disgust|> Don't call it a cake. Aotta's got a good kickass name for it....*hugs*.
4142,<|emo_disgust|> They don’t need to commentate but they sure do make for some REALLY bad cringe.
4143,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is what's wrong with this state.
4144,<|emo_disgust|> This person is a horrible human being with so much BPD.
4145,<|emo_disgust|> It was weird getting my thoughts on something so immediately reactionary
4146,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing worse than living in a bubble is living in a giant fucking bubble.
4149,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, don’t tell those with arms!"
4150,<|emo_disgust|> I don’t know why he left but I’m gonna go ahead and call bullshit on his stats for the season as a whole
4151,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't know the answer, I just know that this is extremely frustrating for you."
4152,"<|emo_disgust|> The people that support it, i can't tell which side you're on."
4153,<|emo_disgust|> This was so stupid. I can't believe we elected this goon
4154,<|emo_disgust|> That was nasty.
4155,"<|emo_disgust|> That sounds horrible, man. Did he say no?"
4156,"<|emo_disgust|> No, she did/ She’d want to be left alone in case she doesn’t see results."
4157,"<|emo_disgust|> Well it isnt any of my business but I’d like some more information on it. If you ever have any leads on any possible suspects, let me know. Thanks for the information."
4158,<|emo_disgust|> Oh. My heart!
4159,"<|emo_disgust|> This is worse than the original gif, hands down."
4160,<|emo_disgust|> I feel like they're trying to be too hard on [NAME] because she was a good coach there and has a ton of experience.
4161,<|emo_disgust|> He could die of old age.
4162,<|emo_disgust|> It's really weird that the last update didn't change the loot box at all. Maybe they just aren't that player sensitive.
4163,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I know I should say no but I really hate not having sex at all.
4164,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Shed your tears into the ocean - they will not be washed away"" - [NAME]"
4165,<|emo_disgust|> Well that's disgusting
4166,<|emo_disgust|> I hate to say this but I love some of the stuff posted here lately. But what the actual fuck....
4167,"<|emo_disgust|> That's bad, because I would hate to go back to New Britain."
4169,<|emo_disgust|> They’re disgusting and insane.
4171,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a worse than [NAME] for some reason
4172,<|emo_disgust|> It's not. He literally has no skin on him. Geez.
4173,<|emo_disgust|> He’s ugly
4174,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is getting destroyed [NAME] and you wonder why he’s ""winging it"""
4175,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME]!!!
4176,<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry.
4178,<|emo_disgust|> If you don't love her or were her parents (in her case alexis and julia) you are stupid.
4179,<|emo_disgust|> i love you
4180,"<|emo_disgust|> I was surprised the [NAME] didn't say the word ""fucking"" twice."
4182,<|emo_disgust|> F*ck I'm hungry now.
4183,"<|emo_disgust|> Fuck I thought everyone hated [NAME], not just the scum of Reddit."
4184,<|emo_disgust|> If you can't stomach it then don'tuge
4185,<|emo_disgust|> That [NAME] is really bad
4186,<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting. VWP
4187,<|emo_disgust|> I’ve seen this one before.... it’s awful
4188,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird, he doesn't go down without a kill, which is really rare but still happens"
4189,<|emo_disgust|> The dude just has weird hair.
4190,"<|emo_disgust|> He is a moron for calling his rival a ""bimbo"" (incorrectly) while calling her a ""cute little bimbo""."
4191,"<|emo_disgust|> It's not the ""I'm sorry"" that saddens me. It's the personidly knowing you're not sorry."
4192,<|emo_disgust|> > It's more pathetic than you think.
4193,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, I don't see any shoes or anything on this girl..."
4194,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, but it's awful."
4195,"<|emo_disgust|> No, no, it’s the worst."
4196,<|emo_disgust|> What does that even mean? What a uselessly vague statement.
4198,"<|emo_disgust|> It's called the ""YT vids"" guy.. I hate those."
4199,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like im kind of rude but he seems pretty sweet
4200,<|emo_disgust|> This is almost worse than a creepy old drawing.
4201,<|emo_disgust|> The best thing about the blizzard shutdown was the ability to play in new york again
4202,<|emo_disgust|> That's a weird way of spelling Disenchanted
4203,<|emo_disgust|> Why is this making me so angry? I hate r/tworeddit
4204,<|emo_disgust|> Those legs....they were so Damn proud.
4206,<|emo_disgust|> I hated [NAME]. He took my entire childhood
4207,"<|emo_disgust|> That doesn't look like a power tool, it looks like a fucking tool."
4208,"<|emo_disgust|> There's no way around it, so yes, you do have a very difficult time. "
4209,<|emo_disgust|> The whole thing is ridiculous.
4210,<|emo_disgust|> This was a horrible decision. What a terrible person she is.
4212,<|emo_disgust|> If you ever do that I will kill your entire family I promise
4213,<|emo_disgust|> I’m not fucking ordering chicken nuggets.
4215,"<|emo_disgust|> Man I don't have any more friends. Fuck, I was the only one not talking about shit."
4216,<|emo_disgust|> This team needed a new identity to replace what was lost withrid performances and the coach seems to be completely unidentifiable to the players. I’m honestly shocked this hasn’t happened yet.
4217,<|emo_disgust|> Your a moron.
4218,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like im a stubborn one
4219,<|emo_disgust|> Your character seems to lose it after she asks how things were in Hidalgo. Weird.
4220,<|emo_disgust|> I hate [NAME] but boy is this shit good.
4224,"<|emo_disgust|> Aghhh, rape. The gross stuff. "
4226,<|emo_disgust|> It's called racism and is a huge problem in some countries.
4227,<|emo_disgust|> If [NAME] has it better than [NAME] I'd be livid
4228,"<|emo_disgust|> You should give him a hug and tell him, you know he is a horrible person, he doesn't deserve that."
4229,<|emo_disgust|> That was such a horrible open shot.... he missed
4230,<|emo_disgust|> They are all so damn similar to me. It's so infuriating how similar everyone is to myself.
4231,<|emo_disgust|> It's not fair! I’m sure he’s fine with that since he is a good player.. but a league that punishes goalies for poor starts? Ugh.
4232,<|emo_disgust|> Your a disgusting kafir
4233,<|emo_disgust|> How dare he not take pictures with girls!!
4236,"<|emo_disgust|> In light of the recent revelations concerning his campaign, this makes me SHOCKED at how much control and money was transferred by the Democratic Party to the Hillary Clinton campaign. "
4237,<|emo_disgust|> Weird how he used ‘cis men's bathroom’ for men. Pretty gross
4238,<|emo_disgust|> This is truly disgusting.
4240,<|emo_disgust|> i do feel that i have a right to be mad at my parents s behavior
4241,<|emo_disgust|> I feel like a horrible human being for writing that
4242,<|emo_disgust|> She’s making herself look even more pathetic by posting this
4243,"<|emo_disgust|> Fuck it I'll buy one, the old ones are really only really good if you have shitty internet"
4244,<|emo_disgust|> Damn it
4245,"<|emo_disgust|> Well that sucks. I'd rather be a [RELIGION] [RELIGION] [RELIGION] than remain in the UK. But yeah well, here."
4246,"<|emo_disgust|> This is a very obvious joke [NAME], it's just more offensive to be making fun of mental illness."
4247,<|emo_disgust|> I don’t think I’ll go to a strip club anymore because this is disgusting
4248,<|emo_disgust|> Those ears...those ears...those ears are stinking.
4249,"<|emo_disgust|> And yet, somehow, I find myself hating the New York Jets."
4250,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking hell I was wondering what that was
4251,<|emo_disgust|> I feel attacked /s
4253,<|emo_disgust|> The best part: he was 5 foot 9
4254,<|emo_disgust|> I feel ya.
4256,"<|emo_disgust|> I am a disgusting, dangerous lunatic."
4257,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, at least they don't call the cops on you. So you can't go to prison."
4258,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is not some sort of god. He's an opportunity for a man to be inspired to be a man.
4259,<|emo_disgust|> How dare she! Surprised she hasn’t done this yet!
4260,<|emo_disgust|> That’s just disgusting.
4261,<|emo_disgust|> Damn this stuff is hot. I'm gonna try a can of cornbread tonight.
4262,<|emo_disgust|> You have to be a disgusting creep to use that term.
4264,<|emo_disgust|> Oh that goes both ways tbh I've got one job I could abuse but other than that I don't see any reason to work here
4265,<|emo_disgust|> The only one to truly love [NAME] is her sister.
4267,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I'll kill you if you do that to a horse!
4268,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is when people who know you and your background contacts then call you and try to start a relationship with you.
4269,"<|emo_disgust|> But we still have them saying ""birth control"" when it is not a pill. That isn't how it works."
4270,"<|emo_disgust|> I thought not being able to see the sarcasm was the problem, then again I'm a little weird"
4272,<|emo_disgust|> The fuck are you on about now
4273,<|emo_disgust|> She probably fears for her life in case something happens to you.
4274,<|emo_disgust|> You're so racist
4275,<|emo_disgust|> I was a victim. He beat me up. And that's how I ended up in that jail cell with my mom.
4276,<|emo_disgust|> What the hell are you talking about
4278,"<|emo_disgust|> If a cop kills a kid because he is suspicious of a suspicious person, that has to be an awful reason to shoot a kid in the back. Unless you are some asshole who just wants to go out and ruin his kid's life."
4279,<|emo_disgust|> > This is how it's always been This is how it's always been
4280,<|emo_disgust|> My name is [NAME]. I do this all the time. It's not glamorous but it's damn fun.
4281,<|emo_disgust|> i didnt feel so passionate about it
4282,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking autist.
4283,"<|emo_disgust|> He probably just wanted to be liked, and it was weird to feel pressure to act like you cared. "
4285,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] this is why I am happy for america
4286,<|emo_disgust|> This is exactly what it sounds like...I hate these people so much
4287,<|emo_disgust|> Oh wow sorry friend
4288,<|emo_disgust|> We have no clue....wtf is 2019
4290,"<|emo_disgust|> In your mind, he's a kid who's been abused and neglected. He's an excuse to be an awful person."
4291,<|emo_disgust|> So you really just have no shame or sense of self-worth?
4292,<|emo_disgust|> The fact someone would care about their appearance that much is incredible.
4293,<|emo_disgust|> I have this fear on every single game day. I might die here is.
4294,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is playing the waiting game. Can't expect much else from her.
4295,<|emo_disgust|> Your mom still needs a highlighter for tonight. This shit is making me squeal with delight!
4296,"<|emo_disgust|> You know I have the best memory ever, but... I guess it's because I kept coming back to that day, and I remember constantly rewording and rephrasing until I finally wrote it all down"
4297,"<|emo_disgust|> What are you talking about? I have 6'6"" [NAME] shoes and you're saying I'm 5'11""?!?"
4299,<|emo_disgust|> How DARE you talk to auroras about their mythology! Who said they existed! >:O
4300,"<|emo_disgust|> The real reason you have kids is you don’t want them killing you because ""I don’t want to get fired or threatened for doing my job"""
4301,<|emo_disgust|> That was as clear as day I think. It's weird man you should take this seriously y'all.
4302,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, it would make sense for the team to be looking for a new nose to replace it."
4303,<|emo_disgust|> She reminds me of my crazy sister-in-law. Just a ball of nervousness and constantly just on the verge of crying.
4304,<|emo_disgust|> Your age difference is incredibly creepy. Is she a 15 year old or a 26 year old?
4305,<|emo_disgust|> I hate when I have to listen to my own worst enemy.
4306,<|emo_disgust|> That seems awful. What have you done other than watched porn lately?
4307,"<|emo_disgust|> You're a disgusting, hideous, hideous person."
4308,<|emo_disgust|> The absolute worst.
4309,"<|emo_disgust|> It's weird that I actually wanted him to be less of a reach this season, but yeah..."
4311,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Ebola should not be an option.... It is a disease specifically with regards to Africa"" is an incredibly ignorant and illogical thing to say."
4312,<|emo_disgust|> If its a man it is far worse... Its so gross. Especially the man in white
4313,<|emo_disgust|> i can feel the petty spite and envy that is a part of people
4314,<|emo_disgust|> That feels pretty terrible.
4316,<|emo_disgust|> I will kill you all
4317,"<|emo_disgust|> Shut the fuck up, loser."
4318,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], is this some fucking joke? I was there yesterday. It's hard to believe they're that bad."
4319,"<|emo_disgust|> That face, with that expression... it's one of the worst I've seen. "
4320,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird how often this happens.
4321,"<|emo_disgust|> >The only reason Reddit has become a haven for weirdo behavior is because so many are on there. It's a weird mix of young, impressionable idiots with bad taste."
4322,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is scared out there. Didnt want the ball
4323,<|emo_disgust|> Why are you in this subreddit? I thought I was dead alone :(
4324,<|emo_disgust|> Wow he's worse than [NAME]
4325,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn you're a realist, you know that!"
4326,<|emo_disgust|> He does not. He is a very proud man and will tell any liar the truth.
4327,<|emo_disgust|> Oh come off. It’s a joke.
4328,<|emo_disgust|> I am honestly surprised Facebook isn't blocking all of them.
4329,"<|emo_disgust|> You're in for a surprise, expect it to be unpleasant"
4330,<|emo_disgust|> I can't imagine being on an airport tarmac in Arizona and either not knowing or not caring that you'd be stopped for a pat down. That sucks.
4331,<|emo_disgust|> Weird way to type YYYY-MM-DD
4332,<|emo_disgust|> She still has hands. What a fucking idiot.
4333,"<|emo_disgust|> I hate it when I get calls that are like ""You can pick any number you want for a free test!"""
4334,<|emo_disgust|> People like this are ruining Aus.
4335,<|emo_disgust|> I hated it but I had to. I have no kids yet
4336,<|emo_disgust|> Oh look a player breaking out of a slump and scoring. Love that.
4337,"<|emo_disgust|> If you know anyone who is, it's likely you're not the same."
4338,"<|emo_disgust|> There's no excuse for racism, sexist, hateful, xenophobic, anti-Semitic or anti-Blackbullry. These are just racist and hateful."
4339,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn it, but what's with the giant penis thing?"
4340,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, come off. Didnt want to sound rude, but I also hate spam comments."
4341,"<|emo_disgust|> Man oh man, the return of the [NAME] jersey was worth waiting for."
4344,<|emo_disgust|> Why must your hatred blind you so?
4345,<|emo_disgust|> There it is. I almost downvoted this out of anger!
4346,<|emo_disgust|> Why is everyone singling him out? For the last 2 years he's been pretty boring to watch
4347,<|emo_disgust|> What a fuck you for trying to act like some sort of wise old man. Grow up.
4349,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck this
4350,<|emo_disgust|> Who are you to judge our love?
4351,"<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I understand that it would be hard to give up drug use after just this, but I'm still devastated."
4353,<|emo_disgust|> i feel a little bitchy tonight
4354,<|emo_disgust|> i just feel wronged and hurt
4355,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm on month 9 of OCP, and I have been taking mine for almost 2 years, it's terrible. "
4356,<|emo_disgust|> I do not believe this is a good idea.
4357,<|emo_disgust|> That was the only foul called on him. Wasn’t called anything other than a flagrant and reckless shove.
4359,"<|emo_disgust|> I swear, if my mother were a different sex, I would be dating her right now."
4360,<|emo_disgust|> That's the one guy that I think deserves blame for all of these...
4361,"<|emo_disgust|> She might be horrible, but at least she tried her hardest to be nice :-p"
4362,<|emo_disgust|> The only negative I can think of is her hair.
4363,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting
4364,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you give the finger to a bot!
4365,<|emo_disgust|> This is awful... I’d give it a ten but it is more enjoyable to simply watch
4367,"<|emo_disgust|> How dare the government ask someone to ""dismember their body"" to ""remedy!"""
4370,<|emo_disgust|> They’re both awful.
4371,<|emo_disgust|> This girl needs to find a way to not look at [NAME] and her damn dog like that.
4372,<|emo_disgust|> A lot of people on reddit had these mixed up feelings about it. Thanks for the correction.
4373,<|emo_disgust|> I think the guy just doesn’t like the cold.
4374,<|emo_disgust|> The only one of them who actually tried was the drunk one. He was extremely annoying
4375,"<|emo_disgust|> How awful, imagine if they're wrong on everything else. Worst case scenario, you might get a rude awakening in here."
4376,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling a bit resentful that he hasn’t bothered to ask i guess because he s had less than a year in the job then me
4377,<|emo_disgust|> This is just insane.
4378,"<|emo_disgust|> I want to say that I'm shocked. Disgusted, but not shocked."
4380,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you not find domestic abuse funny! /s
4381,"<|emo_disgust|> You're a disgusting piece, you dirty dog you."
4382,<|emo_disgust|> That's just weird. Especially since they also had a 3 point line for most of the game.
4383,<|emo_disgust|> The fact 2 days before a critical mass is a critical mass. You're a fucking idiot.
4384,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is when state/church/municipal government contracts with large corporations in exchange for campaign contributions. Very sad indeed
4385,<|emo_disgust|> We're all so scared to look our fellow human beings in the face that it actually hurts...
4386,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] no.
4387,<|emo_disgust|> They are angry. Angry at the world. Angry at the human race. Good. Let's get them.
4388,<|emo_disgust|> He gets paid to hate them... How insecure can you get?
4389,"<|emo_disgust|> Fucking hate [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME]"
4390,<|emo_disgust|> I think the biggest Nightmare
4391,"<|emo_disgust|> Who got us that job, [NAME]?"
4392,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] what she did to deserve all this hate and I'm not crying either.
4393,<|emo_disgust|> It's disgusting.
4394,<|emo_disgust|> This is an opportunity for them to look miserable.
4395,<|emo_disgust|> How awful. Never would have thought about that. The way society treats these cases is just disgusting.
4396,<|emo_disgust|> It’s a fact that most of these men would either rather commit acts of mass murder or at least commit acts of cowardice without consequence. They’re just looking to protect their own skin.
4397,<|emo_disgust|> Holy sh*t I think I see cheekbones.
4398,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck it.
4400,<|emo_disgust|> I want to see them punished
4401,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a great shooter but he cant defend most positions
4402,<|emo_disgust|> That [NAME] was such a horrible defender
4403,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck him.
4404,"<|emo_disgust|> No, he was eating an entire Crab Pie he hardly anything and the only thing holding him back was his discontent with another girl."
4405,"<|emo_disgust|> That’s one big, grossass tip. I would have hit him hard if I had the chance"
4407,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, that's beyond fucking creepy!"
4409,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, if this is true, I hate the man so much."
4410,<|emo_disgust|> Your brother is a psychopath.
4412,<|emo_disgust|> Oh he dead
4413,<|emo_disgust|> And when the woman got mad at him for moving his house and he called her a bimbo...
4414,<|emo_disgust|> You will hate this.
4415,<|emo_disgust|> Holy moly I hate him even more now. He’s worse than [NAME].
4417,<|emo_disgust|> I am sorry man sounds bad
4418,<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell thought he was fcking serious though
4419,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is an embarrassment to this state
4421,<|emo_disgust|> So obnoxious.
4422,<|emo_disgust|> There were also claims of state secret police and coup. Those are two very large claims and have not been tested.
4423,<|emo_disgust|> I hate this guys video
4424,<|emo_disgust|> That feels so disgusting.
4425,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn you, that video is garbage."
4426,<|emo_disgust|> I would've gone too if I didn't know someone was going to be in on it and knew they were breaking the rules
4427,<|emo_disgust|> What's worse is going out with someone that you know is a potential rapist or murderer.
4428,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] sucks
4430,<|emo_disgust|> I agree with most everything that you said except the last part about using your power and influence for the greater good.
4431,<|emo_disgust|> Why wont I just swallow them and call it a day
4432,<|emo_disgust|> This is fucking creepy.
4433,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing about this picture is how [NAME] is getting a face lift just in the photo.
4434,<|emo_disgust|> How can you hate people when you actually love them?
4436,<|emo_disgust|> I have no fucking clue what you are on about but I'd think about going to your blog.
4437,<|emo_disgust|> i never even think about the pain of having an argument with you guys that makes me even more angry at god
4438,<|emo_disgust|> I hate it that they're not getting a free ride on the cost of the workers.
4439,<|emo_disgust|> I'm kinda weird a girl in my family is my best friend's sister in law so that obviously sucks
4440,<|emo_disgust|> This is a weird thing to worry about. Especially since there's not much actual research into it.
4441,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] just needs to get a new name
4442,<|emo_disgust|> Don't judge us!
4443,<|emo_disgust|> Oh my [NAME] no
4445,"<|emo_disgust|> The other day I was like ""I wish the sun was shining"" and people were like "" Yeah, damn the sun is"""
4446,<|emo_disgust|> What a nasty goal. Gives you chills.
4447,<|emo_disgust|> Weird flex and seems a little bit aggressive
4448,"<|emo_disgust|> How horrible. Imagine if we lost [NAME] on our second line. Great depth, but [NAME] probably worth it"
4449,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, I'd say it's probably illegal. But that's not really the goal we have set."
4450,<|emo_disgust|> What did I just read
4451,<|emo_disgust|> He doesn’t. It’s a disgusting lie and an insult to intelligence
4453,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is horrible. He needs to go
4454,<|emo_disgust|> I honestly miss [NAME]
4455,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah it's weird, no one feels the word weird enough to write it down."
4456,"<|emo_disgust|> Who said I hated him? I didn't hate him, but I think he's done a lot worse."
4457,<|emo_disgust|> He was fired from his job he had years ago for apparently harassing his male coworkers. I believe those harassments relate to sexual harassment in the past
4459,"<|emo_disgust|> She went out of her way to say that [NAME] should have stood down years ago. How dare she apologize now, she's an asshat. "
4460,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damnit I'm on my phone now, oh no"
4461,<|emo_disgust|> The more you make them the worse it gets.
4462,"<|emo_disgust|> This is really disgusting. One of my 7 does this every time he gets the ball, and he doesn't even care. What a spoiled, spoiled baby."
4463,<|emo_disgust|> Now get out asap!
4464,"<|emo_disgust|> If there is a ""recovery mode"" in place it's awful, it'll let you grind and it'll let your character level up while you're stuck in a hardcore mode. "
4465,"<|emo_disgust|> It's actually hard to look at, it's just gross."
4466,<|emo_disgust|> He is just terrible at his job
4467,<|emo_disgust|> They are just horrible people who just happen to enjoy posting videos of themselves doing weird stuff
4469,<|emo_disgust|> Those are the scariest things I've ever read on here.
4470,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] why I love reddit.
4472,<|emo_disgust|> The way they phrased it made me feel bad for [NAME]. I’m just mad that something like that canous fucked up his brain for so long.
4473,<|emo_disgust|> I am going to have to get used to the taste ofaria. It’s an absolute nightmare.
4474,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is pretty damn creepy
4476,"<|emo_disgust|> That's a good one, though. I'm not gonna lie...I'm a little sad now."
4478,<|emo_disgust|> It’s so pathetic why they keep using them.
4479,<|emo_disgust|> That last bit scared me off.
4480,<|emo_disgust|> He must really hate losing to them since he went 4-for-5 from 3-point range.
4481,"<|emo_disgust|> No no, but it would be weird if it was ""owned"" by a state"
4482,"<|emo_disgust|> How about this. ""Ooooh, that was a good one. Thanks for pointing it out!"""
4483,<|emo_disgust|> Lol you're the racist with the glasses.
4484,<|emo_disgust|> So sorry. Where about you are right now and what is your plan now? It sucks losing you friend. :( That poor pooch. 🙄
4485,<|emo_disgust|> I feel like the kid caught red handedering in a busy intersection
4486,<|emo_disgust|> What did we do to earn his forgiveness? We beat him to it
4487,<|emo_disgust|> You can't just say it's not there. You have to show proof your claim is wrong. This is extremely frustrating.
4489,<|emo_disgust|> That is so disgusting. Im disgusted.
4490,<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck. There's no way [NAME] should lose to Okc.
4491,"<|emo_disgust|> She was the one who said I had no choice but to have a kid, not [NAME] [NAME]. I was just being a whiny, entitled bitch. "
4494,"<|emo_disgust|> This is why we are fighting back. Outrage. It is so disgusting, and yet, so incredibly hopeful. Sooooo many supporters are angry, too. "
4495,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck em.
4497,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst I've ever seen. How dare you! Please be professional and responsible in the future.
4498,<|emo_disgust|> This is so Damn creepy. Good riddance to awful rubbish.
4499,<|emo_disgust|> I am sorry for your loss. My thoughts and condolences are with you.
4500,<|emo_disgust|> How dare she mention her tattoo at an interview!
4501,"<|emo_disgust|> It’s awful, you can see it on their’ website."
4502,<|emo_disgust|> This is painful
4503,<|emo_disgust|> > It's like I’m watching a scene in a horror movie and screaming.
4504,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm the same. I hate the feeling, but it's reality. "
4505,"<|emo_disgust|> I would call bullshit. They're still broke and on public assistance, they need help and are not child neglect."
4506,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, that makes sense I haven't seen it but if something like that happens to you it probably wouldn't be too sympathetic."
4508,<|emo_disgust|> That was so disgusting of him to call a fan of his a faggot and a jealous jealous (sadly) middle aged man.
4509,<|emo_disgust|> No they do but it is more playful
4510,<|emo_disgust|> Don't forget our [NAME] awful home record since...uhhh
4511,<|emo_disgust|> I'll never be with a beautiful woman unless I'm with someone beautiful.
4512,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not crying.. you're freaking crying
4513,<|emo_disgust|> You are a horrible person.
4514,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was literally 2 for 2 on the plays the refs didn't call back and they made a terrible call on purpose!
4515,"<|emo_disgust|> It's not too bad to be fair though. A lot of people hate on his work, so..."
4516,<|emo_disgust|> i woke up feeling very disgusted with myself the morning was the worst thing that ever happened to me
4517,<|emo_disgust|> > Also [NAME] got his arm bandaged and handbags but that injuries looked worse than a knife attack!
4518,<|emo_disgust|> That was a horrible open shot....
4519,<|emo_disgust|> She'll never lose to say the least. Even with [NAME] she'll probably lose anyway. 
4520,<|emo_disgust|> It's so infuriating.
4522,<|emo_disgust|> Oh damn it I’m getting flashbacks to that
4523,<|emo_disgust|> What is ironic about the title
4525,<|emo_disgust|> Lol that’s what I meant
4526,"<|emo_disgust|> Why should I be offended by the presence of attractive and intelligent people in my home town of Edmonton, Canada?"
4527,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] should be out there instead of [NAME]
4528,<|emo_disgust|> What in the actual fuck is [NAME] doing?
4530,"<|emo_disgust|> I'll always take the L train under the N train anyway, so why the fuck should people complain about the L train?"
4531,<|emo_disgust|> i feel weird for saying this because ive already called him out multiple times for his behavior but it does make me wonder sometimes
4532,<|emo_disgust|> That’s the worst catch I’ve ever seen.
4533,<|emo_disgust|> Why is it that so many people hate [NAME] and think that she's horrible but you *don't*?
4534,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird, same."
4535,"<|emo_disgust|> In other words, when she lied about anything, it was because she felt like it"
4536,<|emo_disgust|> She’s the worst
4537,<|emo_disgust|> Damn [NAME] was just making it awkward
4538,<|emo_disgust|> You can smell the hypocrisy on certain parts of his speech. Such was in evidence here
4539,<|emo_disgust|> This is the scariest thing I've seen on this thread yet. I'm so disgusted that these people are trying to tell the truth.
4541,"<|emo_disgust|> Don't forget the /s, she is a big n*** "
4542,<|emo_disgust|> Sooooo inappropriate.
4543,"<|emo_disgust|> I don’t drink myself to death, thank you so much. "
4544,<|emo_disgust|> I wish I could be a god.
4545,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird but yeah.
4546,<|emo_disgust|> Not to mention that it's overpriced...
4547,<|emo_disgust|> There is some confusion out there that I think is dangerous.
4548,<|emo_disgust|> I'm thinking about this at 4am. The worst has just started.
4549,"<|emo_disgust|> And yet, it’s terrible in every single way possible"
4550,<|emo_disgust|> i do not ever feel as though i don t have to agree with him
4551,<|emo_disgust|> He's so creepy
4552,"<|emo_disgust|> Holy [NAME] damn, that scene was Absolutely brutal."
4553,<|emo_disgust|> That's some weird way of spelling Disenchanted
4554,"<|emo_disgust|> But wait you are an admirer of [NAME]""s work! Why would you let someone steal from you!"
4555,<|emo_disgust|> He is a psychopath. Stop being so ridiculous. I’ve sat next to men who were above average. They just had a bad day.
4556,<|emo_disgust|> He also does this in adult voice too
4557,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, that's terrible, I hope you understand, and that you are okay"
4558,<|emo_disgust|> > But I won't buy it because she sounds hideous
4559,<|emo_disgust|> Who woulda thunk that
4561,<|emo_disgust|> My cat just attacked me for treats and scratched me on the finger while I was cleaning
4562,<|emo_disgust|> I hate snow. It's just gross.
4563,<|emo_disgust|> She's literally just being obnoxious.
4564,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking idiot lol.
4565,<|emo_disgust|> The reason I didn’t love [NAME] is that I thought he could’ve possibly played worse
4566,<|emo_disgust|> Don't use your shitty excuse to be fat.
4567,<|emo_disgust|> I have just had an episode of horrible mental health advice.
4568,"<|emo_disgust|> Man am I glad [NAME] didn't book [NAME], they both awful :(. "
4570,"<|emo_disgust|> When the refs missed huge calls on both teams last night, I was ecstatic. And yet, now we have another (sad) blowout loss."
4571,<|emo_disgust|> The first one was bad
4572,<|emo_disgust|> This is so horrifying. Eleven??? A baby! How absolutely heartbreaking for you. You must be shaken.
4573,<|emo_disgust|> And it’s worse because private matches are just *much* worse
4576,"<|emo_disgust|> Well the fact he went out of his way to attack a plain old, unprotected black man, and got arrested... that really makes it weird."
4580,<|emo_disgust|> I'd say there's a good chance she was doing it for attention. Did that actually work?
4581,<|emo_disgust|> The worst game that you can win in a world with so many others?
4582,"<|emo_disgust|> The worst is when you think ""I'll pass it"" and then a moment later decide to hit the go button"
4584,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, I want to steal this for my daughter's birthday"
4585,<|emo_disgust|> So fucking heart warming. Brother love man it’s wholesome as shit.
4586,<|emo_disgust|> i was feeling impatient and was getting all stressed out
4587,"<|emo_disgust|> > It’s a strange thing men are taught in society We are taught to be ashamed of our penises, but not our pubic hair?"
4588,<|emo_disgust|> Oh wow. I’m sorry buddy
4589,"<|emo_disgust|> I have serious trust issues and while I can't speak for the issues, I'd say I'd be quite surprised if you did or haven't."
4590,<|emo_disgust|> That was not an accurate assessment. I've never been a fan of his but he's also a very good argument for why [NAME] should not be president.
4591,<|emo_disgust|> Lol sooo much worse than me
4592,<|emo_disgust|> Damn. My parents have been together almost 24 years and I honestly feel like I'm still an only child.
4593,<|emo_disgust|> Lol you’re a monster
4594,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not a [NAME]. I'm a [NAME] fan. What a cross-over
4595,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating. I feel for you.
4596,<|emo_disgust|> The worst case is he just got into the house late one night and stole some valuables.
4597,<|emo_disgust|> Don't talk about [NAME] for fucking three decades now.
4598,<|emo_disgust|> Who the fuck does this
4599,<|emo_disgust|> That's bad
4600,"<|emo_disgust|> Omg, I’m so sorry🤪"
4601,<|emo_disgust|> Damn. That's rough.
4602,<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck is a Weeb
4604,"<|emo_disgust|> The fact that she's aIAN is extremely odd, to say the least. I wonder why she's anIAN. /s"
4605,<|emo_disgust|> i feel really bad about the whole thing
4606,<|emo_disgust|> That's an awful lot of karma!
4607,<|emo_disgust|> Who needs 20 yearomas
4608,<|emo_disgust|> This is a dangerous game.
4610,"<|emo_disgust|> That damn wink slayed me, I felt his smug expression for a split second before I got the fuck out"
4611,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is bad....
4612,<|emo_disgust|> The dude's face is the face of [NAME] and he's angry like the fucking face of [NAME].
4613,<|emo_disgust|> This looks like total garbage. Wasted 18 months of development time on this.
4614,<|emo_disgust|> Well you fucked your friend for no good reason and now she sucks because of it
4615,"<|emo_disgust|> If you're not satisfied with a relationship, it's a sign that you're not in a healthy emotional place."
4616,<|emo_disgust|> He was a professional sexual predator. If he assaulted you he knew you were't a virgin. Stop being so emotionally and physically abusive.
4617,<|emo_disgust|> That’s really creepy.
4618,<|emo_disgust|> i feel i am very fucked up i feel that i can no longer have the trust of the people i care about
4620,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing they want you to know is that they will never ever find a woman who will agree to be a virgin to them.
4621,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn I want to go back
4622,<|emo_disgust|> What a disgusting person that's [NAME]
4623,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you think like this [NAME] I’m a [NAME]
4626,<|emo_disgust|> That is so infuriating and disgusting. I am so sorry for your friend's situation.
4627,<|emo_disgust|> They are a very easy sell. Everyone in this sub wants to be liked. I hate it.
4628,<|emo_disgust|> And if it's the other way around it's even worse
4629,<|emo_disgust|> How dare she wear swim trunks to a competition
4630,<|emo_disgust|> What the hell is going on at Dillard’s? I’m so fucking hungry
4631,<|emo_disgust|> I didn't have to say that. I'm not being an asshole there. I just thought the other OP didn't like his memes.
4632,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I'm a bit of a romantic"". ""I liked your OKCupid profile"""
4633,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is an awful player, i hate my teammates and i hate this team"
4634,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah right. She lost her home! The only thing she'll have left is your fucking pictures
4635,<|emo_disgust|> It's absolutely disgusting what your father did to his body.
4636,<|emo_disgust|> But [NAME] was horrible
4637,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, now they've told no one and now there is talk of a possible recall."
4638,<|emo_disgust|> I could cry all day. I could be convinced of anything by just seeing her face.
4639,<|emo_disgust|> > You're a weirdo.
4641,<|emo_disgust|> i know that i know but i feel very dissatisfied
4643,"<|emo_disgust|> It’s a rather obvious jab, what a horrible thing to say. "
4644,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, that's just ignorant. People are aware of what guns are and don't. Stop regurgitating stats with no shred of proof to back them up."
4645,<|emo_disgust|> The monster!
4646,"<|emo_disgust|> What a sick baby. I had to get off the phone with her mom to call the hospital, because I was really freaking out."
4647,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] can’t breathe...get him out of here!
4648,<|emo_disgust|> She's a fucking monster.
4649,<|emo_disgust|> The fact he said that about football is pretty telling.
4650,"<|emo_disgust|> The weird thing is it doesnt cost any more than a normal license, it just charges you extra like $10. "
4651,<|emo_disgust|> i feel tortured for saying this
4652,<|emo_disgust|> And the reality of it is you probably still won't know it's existence because its such a completely fake story.
4653,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] sucks in college football. He's so boring.
4655,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] what an ass. I really wish she didn't do that.
4656,<|emo_disgust|> Who said no to drugs? He took them at 2:30 like every other person!
4658,"<|emo_disgust|> In your opinion, what are the real obstacles? Can you explain to me what your opinion is? I personally feel for you"
4659,"<|emo_disgust|> That looks so disgusting, but also so pretty... I can't imagine being on her food..."
4660,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh I wasn’t getting a single positive, what a horrible list"
4662,<|emo_disgust|> The media loves to ignore these kinds of stories. It makes all the difference.
4663,<|emo_disgust|> The fuck? I’m so sorry. [NAME] made me swear off Everjustice.
4664,<|emo_disgust|> I’m honestly shocked we are letting [NAME] play like this. Absolutely brutal.
4665,<|emo_disgust|> That is extremely creepy.
4666,<|emo_disgust|> He's a disgusting excuse for a politician.
4667,<|emo_disgust|> Shut your mouth.
4668,<|emo_disgust|> I'm so jealous
4669,<|emo_disgust|> Worst news I have heard all season: [NAME] is done.
4670,<|emo_disgust|> This should make you goddamn well pissed.
4671,<|emo_disgust|> You just posted the same thing but made it worse.
4672,<|emo_disgust|> i feel completely wronged
4673,<|emo_disgust|> What a disgusting cunt. I hope she's never harassed anyone again.
4675,<|emo_disgust|> I’m saying you’re dumb and making fun of your illiteracy
4676,"<|emo_disgust|> The weird way the crudette shape of these is to me looks weirdly like a doghouse, like you're trying to fit a big tire into a tiny space without breaking the fucking case"
4677,"<|emo_disgust|> I mean you can be [RELIGION], and atheist and still hate prayer."
4678,<|emo_disgust|> That’s racist
4679,"<|emo_disgust|> > She's incredibly vain, which is an obvious aspect, but also a terrible part of her personality I can't picture."
4680,<|emo_disgust|> In a few days time [NAME] will have the opportunity to really screw the shit out of a barn and that kid better be a class A asshole
4681,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] you people are so fucking dumb you can't even figure out which state you're in right now
4682,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] - I think he would really like to keep a low profile.
4683,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm thinking you could be wrong, they've never gone worse than 16-27"
4684,<|emo_disgust|> This shirt is directly aimed at toward a very ugly group of young Black men.
4685,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking speak for yourself.
4687,<|emo_disgust|> That is just...seriously wrong.
4688,<|emo_disgust|> i would still be feeling pretty bitchy about going back to my home country again which is unfortunate
4689,"<|emo_disgust|> Shut up [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME]!"
4690,"<|emo_disgust|> Who said [NAME] wasn't great? I'm sorry, but there's still plenty to complain about. "
4691,"<|emo_disgust|> She's still a dude, just a tad larger."
4692,<|emo_disgust|> That damn wink slayed me. Swoon so hard...
4693,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah but you know that's just not true, because she wouldn't, because it seems pretty unlikely."
4695,<|emo_disgust|> That damn [NAME]!
4696,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I'm so sorry.
4698,<|emo_disgust|> Oh and I swear Denver has worse sports media personalities
4699,<|emo_disgust|> I hate this
4700,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling so disgusted about myself im going to have to go back to the drawing board
4701,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling very impatient
4702,<|emo_disgust|> My dad used to do this. It was so gross. I hated it.
4703,"<|emo_disgust|> He has no shame. He has said times that he hopes that this is a false accusation, because he has done nothing wrong."
4704,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn I hate Twitter
4705,"<|emo_disgust|> No he doesnt, what a fucking idiot lol."
4706,"<|emo_disgust|> Not going to happen, I don't give a shit. Just get fucked."
4707,<|emo_disgust|> But she won’t be staying for long if [NAME] kicks her out.
4708,"<|emo_disgust|> This is me all the time, I hate it."
4709,<|emo_disgust|> This is one of those cases where it's far too easy for people to be ignorant and cruel...I'd hate to live in either.
4710,<|emo_disgust|> I've seen him in matches where he's been terrible. He's one of our best players so it's not a shock that he's terrible
4711,<|emo_disgust|> She's disgusting.
4712,<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell has all these power tools but no hammer
4714,"<|emo_disgust|> Because you can't have both, and then say ""both"" just to get heckled on the internet"
4715,<|emo_disgust|> They're so disgusting!
4717,<|emo_disgust|> A man named [NAME] has the weirdest F male ratio in the nfl.
4718,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Dude, your ex-girlfriend broke up with you and now she's taking her to therapy"" "
4719,<|emo_disgust|> You're a disgrace to the species
4720,<|emo_disgust|> i also got to feel like a bitchy bitch for having accepted the gifts
4721,<|emo_disgust|> And to think that the only reason [NAME] doesn’t fall in love is because he isn’t handsome
4723,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so selfish and self indulgent so i will try to give back what i have rather than giving it away
4724,<|emo_disgust|> i feel kind of foolish for saying that but then again ive never really loved or respected music so not really a matter
4725,<|emo_disgust|> > Because our democracy has become a farce with names like that on it. Exactly what I said. What a joke.
4726,<|emo_disgust|> It’s actually rather disgusting how [NAME] is single-handedly responsible for bringing about this mess
4727,<|emo_disgust|> Oh really? The story is actually quite fascinating though
4728,<|emo_disgust|> This is my biggest pet hate of all time!
4729,"<|emo_disgust|> Don't get my hopes up for much, he just won with over 50%"
4730,<|emo_disgust|> Damn you [NAME]
4731,<|emo_disgust|> This is amazing lmao
4732,<|emo_disgust|> That damn wink stinks.
4734,<|emo_disgust|> People are animals.
4735,<|emo_disgust|> You're a very angry cat
4737,"<|emo_disgust|> This one isn't creepy, it's fucking disgusting."
4738,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is such a fucking idiot for writing that? How dare you
4740,<|emo_disgust|> Wow he took a baptismal font and an old hat and created this
4741,<|emo_disgust|> They wanted the rights to our natural resources. Now why are they upset about burning our forests?
4743,<|emo_disgust|> Wow so aggressive
4744,"<|emo_disgust|> Shut it, [NAME]!"
4745,<|emo_disgust|> My life is complete
4746,"<|emo_disgust|> The worst is reading something that has absolutely no bearing on how you are feeling. For example, I just read a post about a kid in his subreddit that has absolutely no affect on me."
4747,"<|emo_disgust|> The saddest thing is, it's just a mask."
4748,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird [NAME] has a weird Twitter handle
4749,<|emo_disgust|> That's what the ads told us. They have no shame.
4750,<|emo_disgust|> Who said I was angry? Lol! Lol!
4751,<|emo_disgust|> Oh yeah that
4752,<|emo_disgust|> The world always seems to bring about great tragedy when one takes actions that weren’t even the intention. Thanks for warning me
4753,<|emo_disgust|> Sooooooo yes?
4754,<|emo_disgust|> Worst. Year. Ever.
4755,<|emo_disgust|> You're a shitty person.
4757,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a horrible and racist human being.
4758,<|emo_disgust|> I fucking hate this.
4760,<|emo_disgust|> In all seriousness though I really do not know that I would put much stock in that. Sounds like it would be a total failure
4761,<|emo_disgust|> This is horrible... I'm so sorry that happened.
4762,<|emo_disgust|> He can't have sex with you...
4763,<|emo_disgust|> If he's that bad who the fuck cares
4764,<|emo_disgust|> Not really cringe but...I thought you were being too dramatic.
4765,<|emo_disgust|> How rude.
4766,<|emo_disgust|> i feel a bit stressed out
4769,<|emo_disgust|> The best is a girl that has a great conversation with you but doesn't make any moves or try to be yours. Girls that are manipulative or lack character always make me cringe.
4770,<|emo_disgust|> That was such a terrible open shot....
4771,<|emo_disgust|> No you are a horrible person.
4772,<|emo_disgust|> It’s a weird thing to say sometimes.
4773,<|emo_disgust|> >It would also allow them to use other people’s money to buy guns So... that’s a scary idea!
4774,<|emo_disgust|> You can't be worse than [NAME] and still be considered an inside guy.
4776,<|emo_disgust|> i feel angry about it
4777,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a bloody monster
4779,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking hate [NAME] as well
4780,<|emo_disgust|> This should be a wake up call to all gun owners. We need background checks NOW.
4781,"<|emo_disgust|> If someone is doing something disgusting, then don't call the police. You're an ass."
4782,<|emo_disgust|> i dont feel insulted or condescending toward them
4783,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah this is the weirdest I've seen them.
4784,<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting...and the clothes were Horrific notgas
4785,<|emo_disgust|> Just don't call him the nastiest [NAME].
4787,<|emo_disgust|> This thread is a good indicator that Reddit is becoming a much worse portrayal of the US....P.S. Canada has better health care.
4788,<|emo_disgust|> He’s a dumbass lol. My biggest issue with him is he never backs down from any of his comments.
4789,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] just attacked me because he didn’t like root beer. [NAME] get his beer back and give me my beer back!
4790,<|emo_disgust|> It's so creepy.
4791,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling a little stressed
4792,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] I remember that. ""You're horrible for making these terrible choices, [NAME]"""
4793,<|emo_disgust|> It can be creepy and weird at the same time. You have to be careful and aware of all of the minor things.
4794,<|emo_disgust|> She reminds me of Ginger from Ginger Snaps but with a slightly different perspective. Ginger Snaps are also incredibly fake.
4795,"<|emo_disgust|> It's not a ""we don't want to tell the [NAME] about our naughty ways"" it's a ""we don't want them to have the last word""."
4796,<|emo_disgust|> That picture really just reminded me how disgusting some people on here are
4797,<|emo_disgust|> I am about to lose it all when [NAME] comes into our dressing room. Omg.
4800,<|emo_disgust|> Holy crap that's horrible...
4801,"<|emo_disgust|> The saddest thing is she thinks she has a message. Well no, just a lousy one."
4802,<|emo_disgust|> We have nothing even to talk about.
4803,"<|emo_disgust|> I was so angry that this person clicked ""like"" when I wrote this."
4805,<|emo_disgust|> This is the first time I've seen the post. That’s truly disgusting. :( You should go to a hospital.
4806,<|emo_disgust|> I'm literally at the game right now because I was wondering what that was and now I'm mad
4807,<|emo_disgust|> Just because you don't like them doesn't make them wrong.
4809,<|emo_disgust|> Oh wow. Have you been to a doctor yet? I thought it had gotten really bad for a while.
4810,<|emo_disgust|> How DARE you.
4811,<|emo_disgust|> If I went to a place where their food was disgusting I would walk out. Life is short & short is the limit with this world 
4813,<|emo_disgust|> She just needs to kiss [NAME] and there won’t be anything left to complain about
4814,<|emo_disgust|> I'm on mobile and I can't see this
4816,<|emo_disgust|> This is a great way to de-escalate situations. Just call immediately and tell him he is not to start throwing elbows into the crowd any longer.
4817,<|emo_disgust|> A disgusting amount of Sesame oil.
4818,<|emo_disgust|> Who’s crying alone in a park now that [NAME] has showed up?
4820,<|emo_disgust|> That is so disgusting. The level ofance and disrespect is disgusting.
4821,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah this is just the worst thing I've ever seen. Take your upvote and go away.
4823,<|emo_disgust|> She should step down. This is so disgusting.
4824,"<|emo_disgust|> And as for not wanting to be the ""bad guy""...well damn."
4825,<|emo_disgust|> I wish I could be like this... I wish someone was here to give me a hug and tell me that everything is so okay...
4826,<|emo_disgust|> Wow I love this! Who made this?
4827,<|emo_disgust|> It has weird spacing and weird directions.
4828,"<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest part is, the guy in the picture didn't even flinch at the bat. He just sat there like ""fuck it"""
4829,<|emo_disgust|> i feel a bit resentful that after my first day in santa claus i feel like getting mad at those who made me go there
4830,"<|emo_disgust|> No, no, no, no!"
4831,<|emo_disgust|> Man I love reddit.
4832,<|emo_disgust|> Your mom is a weirdo.
4834,"<|emo_disgust|> When people are so easy to manipulation, it just seems like a good thing."
4835,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh no, the worst!"
4836,<|emo_disgust|> Oh that’s the worse nightmare.
4837,<|emo_disgust|> You should stop posting pics like this. Stop making such awful adult things.
4838,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a horrible dude
4839,<|emo_disgust|> i don t feel so dissatisfied about the way things have turned out but i don t feel so satisfied
4840,<|emo_disgust|> The secondhand panic and embarrassment I feel from watching this video is astounding
4841,<|emo_disgust|> The absolute nastiness.
4842,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is just saying what every single racist, bigoted, sexist, ignorant fuckhead on this sub wants to say"
4843,<|emo_disgust|> What a cuck....
4844,<|emo_disgust|> So the guy has a disorder of some sort that includes being creepy and unusual. How is a kid supposed to know if a creepy/odd thing has happened?
4846,"<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell thought he was dead. He's been in the news a lot lately, both in the UK press and Reddit circles."
4847,<|emo_disgust|> How dare he ask where I am!?!?
4848,"<|emo_disgust|> That’s a bad take. Also, I’m over there so it would’s seen by others"
4849,<|emo_disgust|> What’s the fucking point of this post
4852,<|emo_disgust|> You probably had a cataclysm with your house that killed your entire family.
4853,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn you and your stupid ""fans"" let this happen tho. Stay strong ❤️"
4854,<|emo_disgust|> The real worry is the possibility of her throwing out the first pitch in 2019 and making us a better team...the worst scenario is her stashing away 20% of the A's 2020 cash cow
4855,"<|emo_disgust|> It does absolutely nothing for us, and it's completely unnecessary"
4856,<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck was [NAME] referring to?
4857,<|emo_disgust|> I'm thinking he just isn't cut out for this job.
4858,<|emo_disgust|> I'm saying your argument is stupid and your name is [NAME].
4860,<|emo_disgust|> >it's not difficult to create fake ID.. how fucking stupid do you have to be to believe that?
4861,<|emo_disgust|> This is one of the worst I've seen:
4863,<|emo_disgust|> That’s a horrible take omg. I’d probably go with the dm.
4864,"<|emo_disgust|> I’ll admit that I was a little bit worried about it and my expectations being extremely high, especially since the game itself was awesome. It did some good redeeming works. "
4865,"<|emo_disgust|> I hope you’re enjoying the free food that the store has, especially the chicken tenders! "
4866,"<|emo_disgust|> You're the worst kind of person, but i love it"
4867,<|emo_disgust|> And those are just the ones the media got wrong. Fake News.
4868,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling so mad now
4869,<|emo_disgust|> I feel kinda bad for the dead guys
4870,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a very dangerous woman.
4871,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is my least favorite on the station right now...
4873,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing that makes me think [NAME] wants to fuck a human being is the way he worded that bit.
4874,<|emo_disgust|> That was truly disgusting. VWP
4875,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, I’m going to need to change my Twitter handle to ‘BamaBros’ because people are suddenly loving my tweeter act..."
4876,"<|emo_disgust|> That's a little girl, a rotten apple. "
4877,"<|emo_disgust|> So, you could've just raped her."
4878,<|emo_disgust|> The amount of fake news in this thread is insane.
4881,<|emo_disgust|> If only that's what it was... but it feels pretty... strange.
4882,"<|emo_disgust|> How dare you interrupt the circle jerk. Out, sir."
4883,<|emo_disgust|> They think it's funny that the girl in the picture in the second pic is wearing a dress. That's not a dress!
4884,<|emo_disgust|> A very real and worrying problem.
4886,<|emo_disgust|> You're just mad because [NAME] is bad on Sunday? Stop talking shite.
4887,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing worse than this woman is a man who accidentally hits you when you're least expecting it.
4888,<|emo_disgust|> It's just so weird that he has a tattoo of a penis around his neck
4889,<|emo_disgust|> That woman is a moron for wanting a grown man for a role model. What a moron.
4890,<|emo_disgust|> The first year they didn't get a single pick that wasn't an absolute garbage-ass pick
4891,<|emo_disgust|> But the [NAME] is so dumb lol. You’re [NAME]
4893,<|emo_disgust|> Just a dude who's jealous of all the girls who play video games.
4894,<|emo_disgust|> So fucking disgusting. chipotle burritos are the new normal?! DESTROY THE BURRITO CHIPS
4895,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is when she doesn't use the n-word but rather racist term to describe an individual.
4896,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn those refs actually fucking hate us, don't they? "
4897,<|emo_disgust|> She just needs to sthaaaaap
4899,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] you're a weirdo
4902,<|emo_disgust|> And that wig goes all the way back to when [NAME] was in high school...
4903,"<|emo_disgust|> That's weird because normally I'd be more than happy to leave that in the past, but I'm still a little bit curious."
4904,<|emo_disgust|> She's ugly.
4905,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that her eyes are all dilated like that makes me wonder if she’s asexual.
4906,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a piece of shit and you should tell him that.
4907,<|emo_disgust|> i woke up feeling so annoyed with myself
4910,"<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell thinks he was trying to run over that dude, seriously."
4911,<|emo_disgust|> Oh gosh i didnt know [NAME] was here. I just called him and he said no biggie. Im so sorry
4915,<|emo_disgust|> A shitpost with no place else to go
4916,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, you mean the state?"
4917,<|emo_disgust|> That’s a big F from me :(
4918,<|emo_disgust|> It’s almost as if this isnt news enough. Not sure how [NAME] thinks the situation is resolved.
4919,"<|emo_disgust|> You're right. Fuck off with your ridiculous BS ""both sides"" line, and stop being so desperate to get your facts straight."
4920,<|emo_disgust|> A couple of times i've had people yell at the building. It's annoying.
4921,<|emo_disgust|> No one is taking this well and I'm so fucking sad.
4922,<|emo_disgust|> That is so disgusting.
4923,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is making stupid phone calls while driving.
4924,<|emo_disgust|> What does your sub about?
4925,<|emo_disgust|> Oh wow. Your comment was more disturbing than the video. Thanks for the sharing. 😣
4926,<|emo_disgust|> He has a lot of self-esteem issues.. women will always pick up on that from him.. its weird
4927,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting honestly.
4928,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Ugh...affordable?"" No thanks, I'd rather give what we have to be greedy and buy something we actually actually need."
4930,<|emo_disgust|> That’s a lot of calories I could lose by just walking.
4931,<|emo_disgust|> It’s creepy as hell.resses and her disgusting lifestyle is a far worse example of what we can expect from her.
4932,<|emo_disgust|> We'll take it a as serious question then
4933,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, the way you worded that made me physically cringe."
4934,<|emo_disgust|> Lol that’s disgusting
4935,<|emo_disgust|> i feel a little intimidated by the fact that i dont have a lot of experience
4936,"<|emo_disgust|> So you're a freak, then don't use your sexuality as an excuse."
4937,<|emo_disgust|> That is rather disgusting.
4938,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, I wasn't expecting the bs. But yeah, damn. "
4939,<|emo_disgust|> Why do our trolls sometimes look like Terri's fromesame Street?
4940,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is when you have a good team but all the pieces fall into place anyway.
4941,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] the worst
4944,"<|emo_disgust|> Just take your shoes off, [NAME]...or [NAME]. Get outta here. "
4945,<|emo_disgust|> > You're a mean person.
4946,"<|emo_disgust|> How dare you, she's your mommy *[NAME]**!"
4948,<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell thought he'd get a kick in the leg
4950,<|emo_disgust|> We could cure child cancer and have the same effect and it won't be socially acceptable *cries in Scottish*
4951,"<|emo_disgust|> You sound upset and upset. You're not right or wrong but, in a worst case scenario, you're very likely an ISM."
4952,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] you're horrible :'(
4953,<|emo_disgust|> I love how it stops just before the impact
4954,<|emo_disgust|> You must be wondering what's so funny about that photo.
4955,<|emo_disgust|> i feel a bit strange saying it because im feeling especially passionate about some other things in the area of politics and culture
4956,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] just lost his shit at the refs, what does [NAME] lack of ability do to lose any more?"
4959,<|emo_disgust|> This is worse than the original tbh. The voice he did here is a fucking atrocious impersonation of [NAME]
4961,<|emo_disgust|> You're a disgusting piece.
4962,<|emo_disgust|> You're probably right and the other half is probably not. But the hatred is there.
4964,<|emo_disgust|> That’s just a disgusting amount of bile.
4965,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] are fucking minds
4966,<|emo_disgust|> i have to say that it feels a little ironic it wasnt an attempt to show off our love but to give a little back to the people of korean britain a couple days ago
4969,<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting. No one should act like that to you. :(
4970,<|emo_disgust|> Well i would enjoy that as well...
4971,<|emo_disgust|> If it's still open next week I'll celebrate by throwing up.
4973,<|emo_disgust|> This is so creepy. Good riddance to terrible rubbish.
4974,"<|emo_disgust|> That's just sad, as a transgender man that's pretty rough."
4975,<|emo_disgust|> My mom is divorcee and has told me many stories I will never understand but every time it's about something that is very solvable 
4976,<|emo_disgust|> That's just damn creepy.
4977,<|emo_disgust|> Because [NAME] is a LOSER.
4978,<|emo_disgust|> I'm jealous of [NAME]!
4979,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking loon...
4980,"<|emo_disgust|> What a weird, bitter thing to say. "
4981,"<|emo_disgust|> It was only in 2016, and it's getting worse. In 2020, it's *aggressively* worse. "
4982,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting... these are some of the worst I've seen.
4983,<|emo_disgust|> Omg that last one is the absolute worst
4984,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I love my sf. What a nightmare
4985,<|emo_disgust|> This is extremely creepy.
4986,<|emo_disgust|> i do feel like im being very greedy and putting more than half of the work load on my mommy
4987,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I'm very sorry. Hopefully you and your family are doing better.
4988,<|emo_disgust|> They’re getting worse
4990,"<|emo_disgust|> Don't let any idiot fool you, [NAME] cares about your well being"
4991,<|emo_disgust|> What a bummer. This episode gave us an even better grasp of who [NAME] really is. [NAME] is still a mystery.
4992,<|emo_disgust|> Now this is poke choking!
4993,<|emo_disgust|> Damn. Your age difference is incredibly creepy.
4994,<|emo_disgust|> That’s so disgusting. Can you imagine if elected? You will be extremely harmful to this country down the road.
4997,<|emo_disgust|> i hate it because i hate feeling stupid
4998,"<|emo_disgust|> I do believe that is the main reason a lot of these young women are hooking, but I see it much more from them."
4999,<|emo_disgust|> What the hell. This isn't about football. This is about how people think mental health is resolved.
5000,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is waiting outside McDonalds.
5001,<|emo_disgust|> It's extremely uncomfortable to look at someone with a cancerous growth under their skin.
5002,<|emo_disgust|> This seems to be a popular belief on this sub.. Idk why but a little creepy doesn't seem to get the joke.
5003,<|emo_disgust|> No! I have no sexual attraction to anyone.
5004,"<|emo_disgust|> I’ll be honest and say I absolutely hate when these days ""haters in a box"" use this term."
5005,<|emo_disgust|> I was never a huge horror fan but now I'm an awful lot of horror fan.
5006,<|emo_disgust|> That's just disgusting.
5007,<|emo_disgust|> Your job is to tell them what you think. Not make them do it.
5009,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Fuck it I'll drive to San Fran instead"" Ok but what if that's the only option you have?"
5011,"<|emo_disgust|> It is pretty clear [NAME] was being sexist towards her, and making excuses for it."
5017,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Voted by the People""? Sounds a little familiar...."
5019,<|emo_disgust|> They are not going to like it anyway
5021,<|emo_disgust|> The reason for posting was to say your mom is insane and needs to be taken into mental hospitals.
5022,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is scared out there
5023,<|emo_disgust|> Oh damn.
5024,<|emo_disgust|> Well that is disgusting...
5025,<|emo_disgust|> The most horrible thing he could do is tell her boyfriend he hates her.
5027,"<|emo_disgust|> Your going to need all the help you can get, it's just a matter of time."
5028,<|emo_disgust|> I’m offended by it all
5031,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has lost it, and I’m so sorry for his loss. This happens all the time on our campus, and it’s justinderd. "
5032,<|emo_disgust|> How dare [NAME] insult [NAME] like that...the only one that matters!
5033,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking idiot
5034,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking idiot lol...
5036,<|emo_disgust|> >Culture is what is disgusting about this
5037,<|emo_disgust|> I actually really like your rant. Much more vicious and personal. Thanks for sharing!
5038,<|emo_disgust|> Weird question. From my experience running to a toilet/shower or an open sink I feel safe
5039,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, it's disgusting. "
5040,<|emo_disgust|> I can imagine! What a horrible person she is!
5041,<|emo_disgust|> She had such a miserable life but she seemed to have a REALLY good life. Just think about all the shit she had to go through after she turned 18
5043,"<|emo_disgust|> This comment has been removed for breaking rules, you have until tomorrow to edit your comment."
5044,<|emo_disgust|> I was getting some weird thoughts from that comment...
5045,<|emo_disgust|> This is theiest press I've ever seen.
5046,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, he has for a long time now. The real problems are the ones he's continuing to face."
5047,<|emo_disgust|> My boyfriend and I have had exactly the same thing happen once and I’m still mad.
5048,"<|emo_disgust|> Fucking bein' on a US Orientee plane at 3am, no fucking clue how that ain’t a problem."
5050,<|emo_disgust|> It's disgusting that this is getting downvoted.
5052,"<|emo_disgust|> Man this sucks for you, good luck on your way out. :'("
5053,<|emo_disgust|> You should see a therapist. It can help you deal with some of the more obnoxious and obnoxious parts of being male.
5054,<|emo_disgust|> I just wanna die
5055,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is so boring in his video reviews. It really comes off as cringy.
5056,<|emo_disgust|> My new favourite bromance
5057,"<|emo_disgust|> It's weird that they'd call them ""hackers."""
5059,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah it is. I'm annoyed that people are taking his post as confirmation that we need to ban all gay people from our streets.
5060,<|emo_disgust|> It's extremely rude.
5061,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch! The pain... I thought he was going to save me but he just teleported away
5062,<|emo_disgust|> A fuck ton of words.
5063,<|emo_disgust|> I'm offended by everything.
5064,<|emo_disgust|> You seem angry. Maybe try reading a book about anger and peaceful protesting.
5065,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah it's creepy and weird
5066,"<|emo_disgust|> When I left, they were charged me $69. And the original fee was waived for two months, which is awesome."
5067,<|emo_disgust|> I was freaking out watching this
5068,<|emo_disgust|> I'm so jealous.
5069,<|emo_disgust|> My little abomination
5070,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a bad defender
5073,"<|emo_disgust|> We have a serious, ongoing and constant war going on right now. Stop being so dramatic."
5074,"<|emo_disgust|> If a company makes you share your personal information with third parties without their consent, that company is putting their employees at risk."
5075,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is actually getting stopped and frisked without cause. Stop justify it.
5077,<|emo_disgust|> I do that too and it's terrible.
5078,<|emo_disgust|> Damn...ittie barber here is a fuckingist
5079,<|emo_disgust|> I feel so fucking rotten for these fukers who believe it.
5080,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] what an ass...
5082,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a horny, mean little bastard."
5083,<|emo_disgust|> I’d call it ugly
5084,<|emo_disgust|> The real bad way to tell if someone is a [NAME] sympathizer is to see how often they talk about [RELIGION].
5085,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing I'm complaining about is [NAME] getting an assist.
5087,"<|emo_disgust|> It wasnt the fault of the show watchers, its the fault of society"
5088,<|emo_disgust|> This sucks for the workers
5090,<|emo_disgust|> You need to get off the phone before her car goes off the road!
5091,<|emo_disgust|> If I was that woman I would've fucked her like a hot rock
5092,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]! That's my favorite!
5093,<|emo_disgust|> Lol kill me now!
5094,<|emo_disgust|> Damn where do you live in north america? I'd love your input :(
5095,<|emo_disgust|> This is a horrible tip. Please think before doing something like this.
5096,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, sometimes I really love these pictures."
5097,<|emo_disgust|> My wife got engaged in the courtyard of our apartment complex and that made me divorce her in less than two months.
5098,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I hated Reddit in the first place...
5099,<|emo_disgust|> Damn we got separated for 3 whole days
5101,<|emo_disgust|> i feel more dissatisfied with everything
5103,<|emo_disgust|> Your company is bad
5104,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has made it pretty clear he wants control back which may explain the discontent but its hard to see the other option as anything but a hostile act
5105,<|emo_disgust|> Not the right sub.
5106,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not giving a fuck about [RELIGION]. I'm fucking taking a fucking stand.
5107,"<|emo_disgust|> Lol, but it doesn't change the fact that you are a terrible person. You are one of the worst people in the world. I hate you."
5108,<|emo_disgust|> i just feel hated on and i hate myself for it
5110,<|emo_disgust|> My god the [NAME] is horrible. He must get injured a lot before he comes back.
5111,<|emo_disgust|> You forgot to add your own flair
5113,<|emo_disgust|> i feel jealous when other people come from big families and then have children in their homes
5114,<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest thing about this post is the amount of support it gets. Thanks for shining a little spotlight on some very dark corners. 
5115,"<|emo_disgust|> This was the worst possible starting point for this. If you don't like the Suns' chances, then this isn't the Worst comparison and you should resent us."
5116,<|emo_disgust|> I thought the show was horrible until I started watching the second season.
5117,<|emo_disgust|> You're a disgusting puffer.
5118,<|emo_disgust|> You're a terrible human being.
5119,"<|emo_disgust|> I want to get out of here with you after this, ok? But still. Can't."
5121,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird to point people at ads and not at people.
5122,<|emo_disgust|> >[NAME] It's even more weird to think that members of a certain political persuasion have the right to decide what kinds of foodstuffs are eaten on their streets.
5123,"<|emo_disgust|> Auch, I hate potholes."
5124,"<|emo_disgust|> This was so stupid, I can't believe it was Bittner and not us!"
5125,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm saying you're calling us babies and disgusting, but you're also saying we're not babies and disgusting. Your argument is completely fallacious."
5126,<|emo_disgust|> Why are these funts so fucking retarded
5127,<|emo_disgust|> You have no clue what fascism is.
5128,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh my good lord, the degree in Disaster Surgeon is horrible."
5130,"<|emo_disgust|> If you don't want to listen to my rant about a show so bad I fucking hate it, then it is not for you. "
5133,<|emo_disgust|> I’d say the same about all media we have at our fingertips these days. This is a terrible country. Stop spreading hate with lies
5135,<|emo_disgust|> We need a [NAME] to take her to the hospital
5136,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit I didn’t realize they were actually driving.
5137,<|emo_disgust|> They still haven't figured out how to charge readers unless you have a phone.
5139,"<|emo_disgust|> That's because the government is run by lootocrats, which is why the budget is so sucks."
5140,"<|emo_disgust|> She's clearly not the most attractive woman in the world, thats what you are being told."
5141,<|emo_disgust|> The worst!
5142,<|emo_disgust|> This is so cruel to animals. I literally feel physically sick.
5143,<|emo_disgust|> >but there was an accident
5144,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is getting the scarecrows. Looks kinda ugly as hell
5145,<|emo_disgust|> You have no evidence to back up your claims.
5146,<|emo_disgust|> I did some research and found out that yes that is a very common practice. (That doesn't mean I'm any less disgusted that our society still believes that men are up there being submissive)
5147,<|emo_disgust|> Wow i think you have it wrong :D
5148,<|emo_disgust|> How about he single handedly destroyed most of the Celtic mythology in Britain? Ireland had it easier at the time.
5149,<|emo_disgust|> That day was absolutely awful.
5150,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird because I love OkC but I'm in Georgia and there's a 6 Day FOG Day weekend
5151,<|emo_disgust|> People can be cruel to other animals? Damnit.
5152,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]? I'm honestly shocked you have health insurance.
5155,<|emo_disgust|> I don't find your character. She has a very odd and somewhat troubled past.
5156,"<|emo_disgust|> I just do. I like to let people have fun, but when someone has $300+ to burn it's just not cool"
5157,<|emo_disgust|> No. They’re disgusting people.
5158,<|emo_disgust|> He was terrible
5159,<|emo_disgust|> That wasn't a foul??
5160,<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest part of this is how good the music is
5161,<|emo_disgust|> Don't call anything a dog unless it has mouth parts. This is a disgusting meme.
5162,"<|emo_disgust|> I think it's ridiculous. His Twitter history also includes a lot of anti[-Semitism], it's just that his public persona is so public."
5163,"<|emo_disgust|> It's pretty much askew as the left's position is on race. When it comes to gay rights, it's worse."
5164,<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry for that. It's pretty awful.
5165,"<|emo_disgust|> Because it doesn't meet current emissions targets (federal targets, targets set by states, targets set by UN targets) and is burning more fossil fuels than ever before."
5167,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn I wish someone would put a huge fucking billboard out in midtown saying ""2nd amendment rights only open to law abiding private citizens"""
5169,<|emo_disgust|> Lol fuck lacy white
5171,<|emo_disgust|> Oh gosh!!
5172,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, you can have a lot of sex without ever having touched a penis before! Shes a bummer! "
5174,<|emo_disgust|> That's... pretty unexpected actually.
5175,"<|emo_disgust|> What a moronic, high-school bully. (I'm sorry)"
5176,<|emo_disgust|> I hate it when mom and dad fight.
5177,<|emo_disgust|> He was so awful But i liked watching it
5178,<|emo_disgust|> I think a lot of people would say that's a bit weird. Is [NAME] a boy?
5179,<|emo_disgust|> It's a lot of words and there is too much wrong.
5180,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME], you missed the chance to kill [NAME]"
5181,"<|emo_disgust|> I actually think the new location is worse, with the old one being dirtier."
5182,"<|emo_disgust|> I agree with you though, he's a little odd in every possible way."
5183,"<|emo_disgust|> Ouch, gross"
5184,<|emo_disgust|> You can't just get arrested for posting a picture of yourself.
5185,<|emo_disgust|> Weird way to spell TB. But hey at least it’s TB
5186,<|emo_disgust|> It's a good thing that all of the posts you've made aren't beingamed back into her face
5187,<|emo_disgust|> Omg yes!
5188,<|emo_disgust|> And we're on our way to an uncertain future. Yours Truly
5190,"<|emo_disgust|> In the words of [NAME], ""Fuck it, I'll swallow my pride and become a [NAME]"""
5191,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit that worked.
5192,"<|emo_disgust|> So, this has now become ""The Story of the Unintelligible."" Good riddance. "
5193,<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest news I've heard on this so far...her new co workers are going to love her.
5195,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking idiotic thing to say!
5196,<|emo_disgust|> I don’t care about [NAME] and [NAME]
5197,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah it would probably only piss them off.
5198,<|emo_disgust|> Who is worst: [NAME] or [NAME]
5201,"<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest part about this: everyone is ""kidding"" about it."
5202,<|emo_disgust|> i feel slightly stupid being honest
5203,"<|emo_disgust|> Well just tell them what I thought, the worst is telling the truth"
5204,<|emo_disgust|> That's my favorite description. She always seemed to be disgusted at the smell of myself and could not imagine it would be so bad if she used it.
5205,<|emo_disgust|> The saddest thing is how many people don't even bother to read the first sentence.
5206,<|emo_disgust|> I fucking hate that.
5207,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I didn’t think you’re that toxic
5208,"<|emo_disgust|> He's a moron, for crying out loud!"
5209,<|emo_disgust|> If I go to the McDonald’s next to the nail salon I’m in for a nasty surprise
5210,<|emo_disgust|> That’s terrible.
5211,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, the ""Thomas the nuclear bomb""? That scarred me."
5212,<|emo_disgust|> This is as racist as it gets. I hate how this comment is still open up.
5213,<|emo_disgust|> That is what I say when I love him. Stupid comments like that just prove how stupid I am
5214,<|emo_disgust|> It's bullshit and anyone who Fact checking it is an idiot.
5215,<|emo_disgust|> What a creepy way to start the day! 🙄
5216,<|emo_disgust|> I'd be creeped out for sure.
5217,<|emo_disgust|> This. Is worse than the [NAME] shit.
5218,<|emo_disgust|> You should just go away
5219,<|emo_disgust|> Oh yeah?
5220,<|emo_disgust|> That's so disgusting. She should be embarrassed.
5222,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is bad
5223,<|emo_disgust|> I’ma speak [fny]
5224,<|emo_disgust|> What's so funny about this? How are you even questioning his mental capacity and mental illness? It's absolutely disgusting.
5225,<|emo_disgust|> I do not enjoy this.
5226,<|emo_disgust|> Oh absolutely! I've had it happen TO me so many times it's almost second nature. Fuck my life!!
5227,<|emo_disgust|> He could have hisias head stuck in a puddle of bacon grease
5229,<|emo_disgust|> You're a disgusting insecure cunt
5231,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm not crying, you're crying"
5232,<|emo_disgust|> Just because you think 2 is better than 1 doesn't mean it's better. If you think 1 is worse then 0
5233,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm actually shocked that he's a vegan, honestly. What a weird, hateful dude."
5234,<|emo_disgust|> This is so creepy and weird. I’m so sorry for your friend.
5235,<|emo_disgust|> >It's bad enough that a man can get laid a lot of the time. I was wondering that too.
5236,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow what an obnoxious, drunk girl. "
5237,"<|emo_disgust|> She is a horrible, disgusting human being, and a huge reason for all the ills "
5238,<|emo_disgust|> This is beautiful it makes my heart hurt I think it really just speaks to me
5239,<|emo_disgust|> i do feel that i want them to stay with the man and there isnt room for more girls
5240,<|emo_disgust|> This is not just me. My family and I have it every damn time.
5241,<|emo_disgust|> That’s a horrible pick... drafted before the [NAME] deal.... wish the Suns had him
5242,<|emo_disgust|> That is just sick! Those poor kids were in no way doing anything illegal.
5243,<|emo_disgust|> She looks just like [NAME]. Kind of like [NAME]
5244,<|emo_disgust|> We are fucking starving.
5247,<|emo_disgust|> Oh I'm just terrible about names
5248,"<|emo_disgust|> I wish I could say that was the only area where we’d improve, but I'm still disappointed."
5249,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit that's bad...
5250,<|emo_disgust|> We don't need an Allianz Stadium in Wigan
5252,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is awful all around, he constantly makes plays look bad and he really should be getting more playing time. "
5253,<|emo_disgust|> I can’t stand DBS
5254,<|emo_disgust|> Oh yeah? Then take your upvote!
5255,"<|emo_disgust|> Why would you think that? People have been burning their barns at an insane rate for 2,000 years. That's pretty constant."
5256,"<|emo_disgust|> It was fuckingiotic. I thought I was insane when I was like ""tf [NAME] fuck her"" then ""tf [NAME] fuck him"" and then the realization"
5257,<|emo_disgust|> This hurts my brain
5258,<|emo_disgust|> That’s rude.
5259,<|emo_disgust|> Not to mention the fact that he is an absolute scumbag.
5260,<|emo_disgust|> I had a stroke reading these
5263,<|emo_disgust|> I hate her so much
5264,<|emo_disgust|> i feel i could be extremely rude at people but for every nay reason this is more than i want to hear
5266,"<|emo_disgust|> She still deserves it even if its just for making people think shes a horrible person. She still cheated on you, what a rotten person."
5267,<|emo_disgust|> Not to be hard on the new guy. I've had worse luck.
5268,"<|emo_disgust|> I thought maybe he was, but damn..."
5269,<|emo_disgust|> Your dog sucks.
5270,<|emo_disgust|> This looks like it was done years ago.
5271,"<|emo_disgust|> This. It’s just depressing, OP is a sick mom."
5272,<|emo_disgust|> It's creepy how many copy paste-happy internet strangers have no idea that [NAME] works for the government.
5273,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful poor planning. Maybe someone should start an awareness campaign for homeless people in certain areas of Sydney.
5274,<|emo_disgust|> I've had this happen to me at a bar. It's the worst when a server doesn't bring you your drink after 4 drinks.
5275,"<|emo_disgust|> I did not ask him about his eating habits, but now that you have, I might. What a terrible, selfish character!"
5276,<|emo_disgust|> Why does this exist and no one wants to talk about it?
5278,<|emo_disgust|> This is such bullshit but thanks for sharing lol
5279,"<|emo_disgust|> People hate him on account of some things he said in the past, but this is really weird."
5280,"<|emo_disgust|> He didn't have to ask for a gun, he just needs to leave the place and not return."
5281,<|emo_disgust|> Don't be an asshole.
5282,"<|emo_disgust|> This is the scariest thing I think I’ve read on this sub this week. That guy literally said this to me, the most confidenceate and professional man "
5283,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm a little sad that the 3DS is still only selling about 100,a was telling us about how much the console had appeal at launch but I think people actually liked it"
5284,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah suck it we'll all think it's just an edgelord going around saying ""nice"" and then someone somewhere says ""no shit"" and gets all dramatic."
5285,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is getting a lot less credit for being a terrific player than he did when he came into the league
5286,<|emo_disgust|> >[NAME] hates you
5288,<|emo_disgust|> People have become so cynical and cynical they'll deface their cars with anti-aircraft emblems..
5289,<|emo_disgust|> The secondhand panic and embarrassment I feel from this is incredible
5290,<|emo_disgust|> This post is stupid.
5291,<|emo_disgust|> Damn liberals!
5292,<|emo_disgust|> So cringy and desperate
5293,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. Well at least she isn't making him an illegal alien...
5294,<|emo_disgust|> That's so disgusting. What a child. He's brainwashed. It's so disgusting. I'm so disturbed to learn this about his brain.
5296,<|emo_disgust|> Who are you trying to be so hate-filled toward because you love your dog?
5297,<|emo_disgust|> I hope so! I really do hope so!
5298,"<|emo_disgust|> When is he supposed to get a good bashing and get that ""federalized"" thing from his gullet to his head?"
5299,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Mozzarella sticks"" sounds exactly like Italian food."
5300,<|emo_disgust|> This is one of the worst I've seen on Reddit. Don't waste your time.
5301,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah she sucks. Sorry for your loss and you both get to experience life without her.
5302,<|emo_disgust|> i feel a bit tortured with it all
5303,<|emo_disgust|> The new buildings are hideous
5304,<|emo_disgust|> The fact he's a self-proclaimed vegan gives me anxiety and heartburn just thinking about it.
5305,<|emo_disgust|> I always wanted to see a penis after the porn haha. Why couldn't I!
5306,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fucking hero, that shit should be the law."
5307,<|emo_disgust|> This is worse than the [NAME] situation with [NAME] and [NAME]
5308,<|emo_disgust|> i feel really quite stressed out
5309,<|emo_disgust|> i was feeling extremely grouchy
5310,"<|emo_disgust|> The reason I like reddit, is because I like being up by myself for like 30+ minutes, and I got downvoted by a guy (me) for Redditing from a cabin up. "
5311,"<|emo_disgust|> Don't bother, we've had plenty of practice against the Suns this season. "
5312,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, [NAME] actually came out and said he hates America "
5314,<|emo_disgust|> Well that was sick
5315,<|emo_disgust|> I miss this sub
5316,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh no, it was the legs."
5317,<|emo_disgust|> I see you posted a picture of your cat and suppose like I posted to my blog lol. Lol
5319,<|emo_disgust|> Well shit man...
5320,<|emo_disgust|> This is so disgusting. One of my church sisters did this and she got excommunication from the church. I'm so sickened by it
5321,"<|emo_disgust|> There are racist morons everywhere, if only we could ignore them."
5322,"<|emo_disgust|> No, [NAME] is not his father. I'm getting a fake name here."
5323,<|emo_disgust|> No. He's creepy
5324,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, [NAME] is getting worse and worse."
5325,<|emo_disgust|> i will say to every woman who has ever told me that i am too hot for you - if im feeling a bit hot to touch you - that might be a bit unwelcome
5326,<|emo_disgust|> And they’re not the only ones. A recent study found that between 1980 and 2002 it took parents who owned a car an hour and a half to process a car payment.
5327,"<|emo_disgust|> I find this sooooo uncomfortable to read I’m so sorry if you are experiencing it, you are most assuredly experiencing a lot. "
5328,<|emo_disgust|> It's disgusting that we continue to pay taxes to fund paychecks that federal workers aren't receiving.
5329,<|emo_disgust|> That's... pretty lewd.
5330,<|emo_disgust|> >You're a horrible person lmao. How you post a video entitled 'how to make a vagina feel delicious' is disgusting.
5331,"<|emo_disgust|> Don't you have fucking foresight? 20 years ago, it wouldve been a fucking no-no. Now, it's the norm. It's just happened so many times "
5333,<|emo_disgust|> Why do you look so damn angry
5334,<|emo_disgust|> This is how you get a warship named after a drug lord
5335,<|emo_disgust|> But [NAME] makes the other drivers worse
5336,<|emo_disgust|> I don't think it comes as a surprise that [NAME] and [NAME] are both fat and both have said they love to eat fat.
5337,<|emo_disgust|> Soooo [NAME] is f**ked
5338,<|emo_disgust|> He has a lot of young kids with him. Doesn't want them around the house when he goes.
5339,<|emo_disgust|> She is a very ugly woman
5342,<|emo_disgust|> I'll die here.
5344,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] and [NAME] can't be friends!
5345,<|emo_disgust|> Wow the heat wave that hasbroken Florida is going to cause flooding in major cities across the country.
5346,<|emo_disgust|> It's the weirdest thing I've read on this.
5347,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, you made my day. Go for more karma and try to remember how special you are "
5348,<|emo_disgust|> i didnt feel rushed i could just walk into my school and start reading
5349,<|emo_disgust|> That’s very disgusting. You should be ashamed for broadcasting that.
5350,"<|emo_disgust|> It's weird. I do this. It's not wrong, but it's weird."
5351,<|emo_disgust|> The thing that surprises me is how many people don’t read the fine print.
5352,<|emo_disgust|> It’s just weird to be sitting at work right now
5353,<|emo_disgust|> Not so much. I'm disgusted that your parents have to suffer through this ridiculousness.
5354,<|emo_disgust|> I know right? That last one left me speechless.
5356,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck that I have two jobs and I’m not getting laid
5357,<|emo_disgust|> There is a special place in hell for people like this...
5358,<|emo_disgust|> Don't hate [NAME] for playing in the NFC East for 5 years. NFC East teams haven't been bad since [NAME] came in.
5359,<|emo_disgust|> This fucking needs to be reposted
5360,<|emo_disgust|> That is so infuriating.
5361,<|emo_disgust|> When has the sun never been shining? How is he supposed to know?
5364,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, that's so creepy and creepy people do these things"
5366,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is in NO way supportive of the Rams at all.
5367,<|emo_disgust|> That was a hell of a goal
5369,<|emo_disgust|> Just got shut down in Jersey for carrying a legally made handguns. I don't have this problem in states like Arizona....
5370,<|emo_disgust|> I hate it too. But I have to try.
5371,<|emo_disgust|> Oh that's so sad
5372,<|emo_disgust|> Why is that comment getting downvoted.out gone. R1
5373,<|emo_disgust|> You've been bullied atwork. Get your harassment under control and stop being so shouty at yourself.
5374,<|emo_disgust|> You can't just be awful at something without some form of encouragement from within
5375,"<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst meme format out there right now, maybe ever"
5377,<|emo_disgust|> There's no way round it for me :(
5378,<|emo_disgust|> This is so awful. I feel so bad for the workers. I hope they make out alright.
5379,<|emo_disgust|> The [RELIGION] church in the picture is disgusting.
5380,<|emo_disgust|> And they're probably all the way mad. I don't hear anything but cheers for the effort.
5381,<|emo_disgust|> Man this is frustrating. Have the devs given the patch test keys?
5382,<|emo_disgust|> I’d probably be more upset to find out they were paying to have us put our names on their jerseys!
5383,<|emo_disgust|> Not impressed.
5384,<|emo_disgust|> He may be a moron but he’s still trying to get elected if he’s honest with [NAME].
5385,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] it’s you again! Here ‘balls’ I hate.
5386,<|emo_disgust|> Lol my friend.
5387,<|emo_disgust|> That’s absolutely disgusting. You should be ashamed for spreading such garbage.
5388,"<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting. I hope the man caught and punished the man responsible. [NAME] is a good man, but a disgusting and shameful example."
5389,"<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting. Wives, you are suppose to have some shame for disobeying her, but this is worse. "
5390,"<|emo_disgust|> Your mom is a moron, and you know it. She should be ashamed for your lack of critical thinking."
5391,<|emo_disgust|> Wow this is really creepy
5392,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a weirdo.
5394,"<|emo_disgust|> > [RELIGION] is a religion, it's a bad place to be a child there."
5395,"<|emo_disgust|> It’s like saying, “I hate it that much” to be able to laugh."
5396,<|emo_disgust|> A guy named [NAME] just won a state fair and eaten in dumpsters...what?
5397,<|emo_disgust|> This really freaked me out. Does anyone have a video of the shaking and burning he gave me?
5398,<|emo_disgust|> Just so disgusting that government should legitimately be regulating this industry...as if there is any need for private profit.
5399,<|emo_disgust|> You can't just say “it’s my opinion” then change it afterwards as if your new opinion sucks. Fuck off you’re a shill
5400,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a horrible person and she’s a terrible politician.
5401,<|emo_disgust|> Well that sucks
5402,<|emo_disgust|> People love him on Yelp:-)
5403,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is worse
5404,"<|emo_disgust|> We are trying to be tough and winning is our goal, nothing else, you need to stop taking the easy way out when it's not where you want it or you're wrong. We understand that but still."
5406,"<|emo_disgust|> There's nothing wrong with saying you're ""proud of yourself"" rather than a ""posterioragulation is bullshit"". [NAME] is actually a terrible person."
5407,<|emo_disgust|> The most dangerous thing is being in a state of mind where you think the other person will kill you.
5408,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry, did I say the White House Correspondents dinner is a terrible thing?"
5409,<|emo_disgust|> But I hate [NAME] so much
5410,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I need to find a 4-hole hole where I can play three quarters in a relaxed environment
5411,"<|emo_disgust|> He actually did, though. I'm still mad about it."
5412,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird because the game was pretty good until [NAME] got hurt
5413,<|emo_disgust|> That’s far more disgusting than the [NAME] videos.
5416,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is making people's hair cry.
5417,"<|emo_disgust|> Now this I can’t believe. I’m a [NAME] and [NAME] was my W2 buddy, good times."
5418,<|emo_disgust|> That's beyond fucking creepy.
5419,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry, what are some ways to get banned without being guilty or evidenceless?"
5420,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is back and he's worse than [NAME] ever was
5421,"<|emo_disgust|> What? No deal, abort, abort. Get out now!"
5423,<|emo_disgust|> Because it's creepy and weird and makes them look older and more responsible than they really are.
5425,<|emo_disgust|> This is so painful. Imagine if you’re anyone close to him. You could lose everything
5426,<|emo_disgust|> Why do the animals just run away whenever they are touched by humans?
5428,<|emo_disgust|> The fucking worst game of all time!
5431,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is getting worse and worse
5432,"<|emo_disgust|> That's a really awful argument to make against the use of xboxone? I don't play xboxone, but that's still pretty awful."
5433,<|emo_disgust|> She's not the worst but she's probably my least favorite.
5434,<|emo_disgust|> You mean 3am cravings? I don't mind 4am cravings but hell yeah for 1pm!!
5435,<|emo_disgust|> I can't remember ever owning an airhorn which is odd because it's not a common thing to find.
5436,"<|emo_disgust|> She's not a politician, she's a publicist and nothing more."
5437,<|emo_disgust|> I'm so [NAME]
5438,<|emo_disgust|> He’s got some ugly A's paint skills.
5439,<|emo_disgust|> The amount of toxic masculinity you're describing is amazing.
5440,<|emo_disgust|> Holy crap...
5441,<|emo_disgust|> I've started playing this game nearly 6 months ago and had no idea this would even exist. I'm so very happy
5442,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking dipshit
5444,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] that was so awful, god [NAME] just hit him hard, god"
5445,<|emo_disgust|> A weird thing happened yesterday night. It was so weird that I'm still awake. But now? Same.
5446,<|emo_disgust|> Oh my god. People. That is really gross.
5447,<|emo_disgust|> She has no idea what fascism is.
5448,<|emo_disgust|> Who’s fucking retarded
5449,"<|emo_disgust|> How is this any different from the [NAME] thing? [NAME] was a very public and notorious disgusting person, he was disgusting when he did those things."
5451,"<|emo_disgust|> In reality it's more along the lines of ""I love football, but if football doesn't interest me...I'll watch porn instead"""
5453,<|emo_disgust|> What about us? Where can we put it?
5456,<|emo_disgust|> She has a fucking face!
5457,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing worse than this woman is a well meaning butcher telling you there are no burgers left in your town.
5458,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting. No decent parent would force their kid to go to bible study if he doesn’t follow it
5459,<|emo_disgust|> They’re all the same dumbass.
5460,<|emo_disgust|> I feel very personally attacked by this ad.
5461,<|emo_disgust|> You are the worst kind of person.
5462,<|emo_disgust|> She can't even do anything herself. How does she expect us to get anything out of this?
5463,<|emo_disgust|> The thing with her is that since they both have the same mother-in-law it’s not a huge red flag.
5464,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, this seems extremely dangerous."
5465,<|emo_disgust|> >the only thing which keeps me going is my obsession with how stupid and evil the US is Really fucking stupid and evil.
5466,<|emo_disgust|> Because their own government is incapable of doing anything about it.
5467,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating. I’m so sorry you had to go through this. 🙈
5468,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, shit you don't want that. Well, you also don't want the truth anyway."
5469,<|emo_disgust|> i feel less cold more often
5470,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so insulted by it all for how easily i can be manipulated and manipulated away
5471,<|emo_disgust|> The most disgusting form of pickle.
5472,<|emo_disgust|> That’s just... Wow.
5473,"<|emo_disgust|> Damnit, I like [NAME]"
5474,<|emo_disgust|> A creepy old man in a fedora beard loins around each restaurant.
5475,<|emo_disgust|> That's horrible. I'm so sorry. Have you resolved the problem yet?
5476,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck reddit and what it stands for
5477,<|emo_disgust|> That is the most disgusting reading I have seen
5478,<|emo_disgust|> They’re such insecure cunts
5479,<|emo_disgust|> So [NAME] took a picture of the girls barefoot with some bushes in the background as she left a shower afterwards. Smh
5481,"<|emo_disgust|> In my day, it wasn't uncommon to get 2 shifts in a day. Good times. "
5482,<|emo_disgust|> No one ever asked before. People here are stubborn like [NAME] when he said no to our offer.
5486,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, who can vote this time?"
5487,<|emo_disgust|> It's even worse than I thought! Look at the comments!
5488,<|emo_disgust|> He’s not making a career out of this
5489,<|emo_disgust|> You're probably right to be concerned. Unless you're trolling
5491,<|emo_disgust|> Lol...he was a star (1925). Not much of an actor but he was damn good in a comedy.
5492,"<|emo_disgust|> This is a hot take, dude."
5493,<|emo_disgust|> Because it happens to people all the time.
5494,<|emo_disgust|> You know it’s a trick if they are wearing comfortable clothes but it’s still weird to ask that
5495,<|emo_disgust|> That's terrible. I'm sorry that's what it's become.
5496,<|emo_disgust|> You're a traitor to thecause.
5498,<|emo_disgust|> This is horrifying
5499,"<|emo_disgust|> When are you gonna start worrying about the people around you and concentrate on the bigger picture, big picture kinda sucks?"
5500,<|emo_disgust|> That's a load of hooey.
5501,<|emo_disgust|> Damn we had the best of starts
5502,"<|emo_disgust|> When I was a kid, there was an all-star who never won a shit."
5503,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a pro-Assad piece of shit.
5504,<|emo_disgust|> The real problem is the media. They never seem to report any of the negative stories. It’s disgusting.
5505,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a fake American. Stop trying to make [NAME] and [NAME] look bad
5506,<|emo_disgust|> How awful. He's dead to me.
5507,<|emo_disgust|> He gets [NAME] out of the way so he can't keep [NAME] on the wing
5508,"<|emo_disgust|> There's no way around it, and it's probably hurting them worse, than if she had just given them all the keys and said nah, this is my house"
5509,<|emo_disgust|> That guy has an injury on his finger...
5510,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds awful. What do you do if he isn't going to accept it?
5511,<|emo_disgust|> It's called an updoot. It's a terrible thing to do to your leaves.
5512,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I’m going to the gym.
5513,<|emo_disgust|> Why it hurts....
5514,<|emo_disgust|> I was thinking the same when I watched this.
5515,<|emo_disgust|> I will never not love her
5516,<|emo_disgust|> It's more than likely the fault of the�news_service_app and the news feed.
5517,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking moronic idea
5518,<|emo_disgust|> I don't want to be rude but I would have had the nerve to say that about a half decent steak.
5519,<|emo_disgust|> And no one seems to mind.
5520,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a dirty cuck
5522,"<|emo_disgust|> It really sucks that you, the average internet stranger, think it's funny to call someone's 15 year old ass."
5523,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck it I'll do
5524,<|emo_disgust|> i feel very offended now
5525,"<|emo_disgust|> How about ending it like a triangle? I think that could be more elegant and less freaky. I'm also from Ireland, there’s no safer place to live there."
5526,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, that is kind of ridiculous. I'd bet he did a lot of things that most of us wouldn't believe."
5527,"<|emo_disgust|> It really is like a ‘trendy’ version of Ourandean times. No shit, just take a breath dude. You probably don't know anything about our history or our people."
5528,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm wondering what happened?? I hope he was OK, because he was always good at telling the truth"
5529,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, you're saying that the only thing I'm worried about is making him miserable. You've never even thought this through."
5530,<|emo_disgust|> I really hate this gif
5531,"<|emo_disgust|> No worries, I was just talking with one of my co workers. Have a lovely day"
5533,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck my life
5534,"<|emo_disgust|> I have no idea. I just got banned and told I should ""evaluate my options"""
5535,<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest part is that [NAME] is only 40
5536,<|emo_disgust|> So rude. Brotherly love
5537,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, that's fucking gross."
5538,<|emo_disgust|> i cant help but feel insulted by every single thing that they say
5539,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, it could have been worse! All the chairs, table, and lamp are still upright."
5540,<|emo_disgust|> He was forced into this marriage
5541,<|emo_disgust|> He must smell terrible when he sweats. That face is one of his worst potential insults.
5542,<|emo_disgust|> This is the only video of mine that didn't get deleted
5543,<|emo_disgust|> i do this because i want my girlfriend to feel like im the one who is hated
5544,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is pretty fucking ugly as far as IMO's concerned, too."
5546,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, I saw that one. Now I want to hear your Worst Nightmare mix"
5547,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't know, I'm just really angry at the world right now, and I wonder why this subreddit "
5548,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is having Too many friends
5549,<|emo_disgust|> The fact she is driving on a road with no shoulders is mind boggling. 
5550,<|emo_disgust|> You must suck
5551,<|emo_disgust|> They've all decided to run under the pretend bridges because they don't want to die from the cold
5552,<|emo_disgust|> i feel very dissatisfied at the moment
5553,<|emo_disgust|> > But it also seems like you have said that you are in fact a moderate. Which is weird for You to say that.
5554,"<|emo_disgust|> You are a sickening mixture of age, stupidity, and animal cruelty."
5555,"<|emo_disgust|> You will be punished to a high doom of hell, and only the pure will be safe!"
5556,"<|emo_disgust|> In my honest opinion, it’s worst game in the world. Honestly all that fault falls on the players."
5557,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a disgusting snob.. Feel bad for the workers
5559,<|emo_disgust|> A dude with fake reddit flair posted a picture of himself holding a sign saying “vote for [NAME]” without any apparent irony. How weird.
5560,<|emo_disgust|> Who knew that [NAME] was that bad
5561,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating. I love [NAME] but this makes me so angry.
5562,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I forgot about the turd cake that we had earlier in the day! I feel as though i missed out for that birthday!
5563,<|emo_disgust|> This is so creepy and disgusting. Eleven yearolds probably think this is funny.
5564,<|emo_disgust|> Wow these refs actually fucking hate us.
5565,<|emo_disgust|> Man you suck.
5566,<|emo_disgust|> It’s so sad that we still have people out there that think being fat is so bad.
5569,<|emo_disgust|> This is stupid. How can anyone possibly take any issue with a woman being reasonable in her situation and have no issue with throwing away her jewelry and having a hard time finding a decent ring?
5571,<|emo_disgust|> No...I don't believe a single one of those women gave birth.
5572,"<|emo_disgust|> I feel you. It’s not that I hate her, but....""Why?"""
5573,<|emo_disgust|> There's this video
5574,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was terrible that game, I'm so sad he's not here"
5575,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds awful. Did you find it tape recordable? I'm pretty certain no. Is that fair?
5576,"<|emo_disgust|> This is so creepy, and so sad. Eleven??? A baby! You don't know what to think about that."
5579,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you ruin the surprise I had been waiting for
5580,<|emo_disgust|> i feel disgusted by my own society
5581,<|emo_disgust|> Don't worry. That's [NAME] face all over it
5582,<|emo_disgust|> i can see a lot going on but you get the feeling that all these seem petty
5583,<|emo_disgust|> I feel your pain. Stay strong [NAME]
5585,<|emo_disgust|> This fucken essay
5586,<|emo_disgust|> Now I'm wondering why everyone hates [NAME].
5587,"<|emo_disgust|> I could go on and on about how awful [NAME] is for running his business in the first place, but that'd be TOO MUCH."
5588,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was our second round pick and was awful for us in Year 3. Also worth considering [NAME] is also in his prime.
5589,<|emo_disgust|> >I would be a terrible teacher. Absolutely horrible. No one can ever fault me. But because of that I'm hated by everyone.
5590,"<|emo_disgust|> That video is Absolutely garbage. Btw, you beat me to this joke."
5591,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, some of us are pretty disgusting, and it's been great. ( Though I'd still like to see her become a Paterno )"
5592,<|emo_disgust|> What a sick fuck.
5594,"<|emo_disgust|> I am an animal lover so yes, it is. I am sick of seeing this type of comments flooding the thread."
5595,"<|emo_disgust|> The thing is, it feels so weird, like you really just have no sense of direction"
5596,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like a stressed out mother sometimes
5597,"<|emo_disgust|> ""You're a horrible person"" ""You're a disgusting, abusive person"""
5598,<|emo_disgust|> It makes me very upset indeed.
5600,<|emo_disgust|> Lol no but it's less of a deal killer than the [RELIGION] laws.
5601,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, [NAME] is horrible."
5602,<|emo_disgust|> I never thought to look at them!!
5603,<|emo_disgust|> This is a good example of why we must ban guns. This poor sap.
5604,<|emo_disgust|> That's why I said it's a bad move if it looks like it's directly on top of the building.
5605,<|emo_disgust|> That’s horrible. You’re saying if he does well that he’ll actually win the general election?!
5606,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah i hate when people make assumptions without backing their statements up with any proof
5608,<|emo_disgust|> Well [NAME] is just a tad too rich for that!
5609,<|emo_disgust|> And to think I said i'm not a [NAME] fan...
5610,<|emo_disgust|> Damn this guy looks like the face of a psychopath.
5611,<|emo_disgust|> It was a horrible call. What a horrible situation.
5612,<|emo_disgust|> She’s not making a baddie a worse one as it were
5614,<|emo_disgust|> It's creepy.
5615,<|emo_disgust|> I’m a guy who hates everything associated with fascism. That’s all there is to it.
5617,<|emo_disgust|> i do not feel so hateful
5618,<|emo_disgust|> How dare [NAME] not defend his honor and put his pride before the people! *throws open the dam
5619,<|emo_disgust|> What is disgusting; your eating a warm meal and the next day you're slaving over the stews looking disgusting
5620,<|emo_disgust|> The fact most people find that newsworthy is not a newsworthy event in and of itself.
5621,<|emo_disgust|> i didnt feel greedy
5622,<|emo_disgust|> The comment was so terrible it made me want to scrawl my own lips.
5624,<|emo_disgust|> He was also seen pushing an agitated child into a swingset at one of his shows.
5627,<|emo_disgust|> I feel kinda bad for them because I'd be worried about them getting measles too. But not measles 😣
5628,"<|emo_disgust|> This is one of the worst I've seen. It absolutely shreds any argument that you get an ""automatic right"" by being born male."
5630,<|emo_disgust|> It just doesn't work. You don't give up the game because someone is worse than you. That is stupid.
5631,<|emo_disgust|> How is it a sin?
5632,<|emo_disgust|> Who wants to listen to one of the biggest bands in the world when it's three in the morning? I had the same thought.
5634,<|emo_disgust|> Not exactly a hostile environment for a child's development in.
5636,<|emo_disgust|> Not really cringe. Just sad we have to watch this
5638,<|emo_disgust|> No it really isnt it can the internet give a fuck what the countries we lived in back then decided to leave us alone and they had a lot better understanding than now lol
5639,<|emo_disgust|> The dude is so creepy every time.
5641,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not sure you've ever seen one but apparently that was done before. It is weird
5642,<|emo_disgust|> I’m really annoyed I had to come this far down to find this.
5643,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, [NAME], how awful. All you did was steal a shirt from a clothing store, what the fuck you n00b?"
5645,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, which seems weird since many are already against same sex marriage."
5646,<|emo_disgust|> Wow....
5647,<|emo_disgust|> You’re an awful person.
5648,<|emo_disgust|> The only good weed is with the help of an airhorn!
5649,<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting. In America we have more women in jail for assault than all violent crimes combined. Stop blaming [NAME] alone.
5650,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't care that much for the game, but this is disgusting. Wtf is wrong with people?"
5652,<|emo_disgust|> Because they hate free speech and due process rights.
5653,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking nugget omg
5654,"<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking cringeworthy load of horseshit [NAME], as you can imagine."
5655,"<|emo_disgust|> So sorry your friend got banned, she's actually wrong on all counts"
5656,<|emo_disgust|> There is such a thing as too many tears... I've had too many.
5657,<|emo_disgust|> I mean I do hate the idea but I am also selfish as shit and live in a big house in wood country.
5658,<|emo_disgust|> I love how the tires are Raiders logo
5660,<|emo_disgust|> It's more like people have forgotten about it and just think the [NAME] thing happened over the weekend.
5661,<|emo_disgust|> It’s so disgusting how these [NAME] babies are being raised. It’s so heartbreaking. You’re right they are neglectful and abusive... but how do you neglect animal abuse?
5663,<|emo_disgust|> That man absolutely sucks. I’m so sorry for his and your partner’s misgivings.
5664,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, I'm still mad about the network not air the wedding. You can do that when it comes to reality shows."
5665,<|emo_disgust|> This is a very good sign you've entered men's lib territory...
5667,<|emo_disgust|> I hate fags
5668,<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting. Any human being could do that. Does it matter? Does this somehow mean there is a zero value to human beings?
5669,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating. I can't imagine having a job that requires this.
5670,<|emo_disgust|> I was wondering too. I don't get the point they are making.
5672,<|emo_disgust|> That was a violent ockanikin....
5673,<|emo_disgust|> She’s creepy
5674,"<|emo_disgust|> What? You’re not wrong, but what is wrong with blaming some poor human being"
5675,<|emo_disgust|> It would be weird having both hands on the control stick
5676,<|emo_disgust|> No. Stop with the nonsense. Go to your local library if you can. They are some of the best places to find things like this
5677,<|emo_disgust|> Don't just distance yourself and its just not. Stay alive and healthy
5678,<|emo_disgust|> It’s actually more offensive to say the LGBT community is a hate group than it is to say the KKK is a hate group
5679,<|emo_disgust|> I wonder what [NAME] would think about this
5680,<|emo_disgust|> Because they're not going to find out. How incredibly dangerous.
5681,<|emo_disgust|> You've said the exact same thing in the pages of The Sunday Times. It's a matter of degree.
5682,<|emo_disgust|> How the fuuuck is that not child abuse.
5683,<|emo_disgust|> That's horrible. [NAME] looks so remorseful. I’m sorry that happened.
5684,<|emo_disgust|> So much fake news. Broke and jealous.
5686,<|emo_disgust|> That is truly disgusting. An industry standards body that is solely responsible for assuring our children are safe in our schools is simply Shame.
5688,<|emo_disgust|> It's the worst when it's something you have control over. The worst is when it's something you took from someone else and gave power to.
5689,<|emo_disgust|> It's a stupid question
5690,<|emo_disgust|> But people hated his guts...
5692,<|emo_disgust|> I’m so sorry for your loss. I’m [NAME] and I’m here for you. 💔
5693,<|emo_disgust|> I've never been this disgusted in a customer service position in my life. How are you getting paid $80?!
5694,<|emo_disgust|> The guy who won this is a complete idiot and is taking advantage of people that just had a horrible time of it. Reminds me of [NAME] from the wild card round
5695,<|emo_disgust|> That's a fucking travesty to the sport of cycling
5696,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that was dirty. Lined up the bastard at 3rd and long.
5697,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is the man for you, as long as you want the hard working, trophy wife"
5698,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like my eyes are going to be smudged after i see the whole thing
5699,<|emo_disgust|> I just don’t like it.
5700,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling very aggravated right now
5701,<|emo_disgust|> Those two cunts - ones mr. [NAME] and rick - are vicious.
5702,<|emo_disgust|> I mean the whole post is bad but the claims are even worse.
5703,<|emo_disgust|> When I was a kid it was horrible. I hated everything at school.
5704,<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting. Now PM will not go to the confidence and supply. I hated this speech.
5705,<|emo_disgust|> You're not. You're a troll.
5706,"<|emo_disgust|> If it looks like an ass, its probably an ass. Not that its a bad thing for women to own anyway."
5707,"<|emo_disgust|> This is why why I’m in Healthcare. This is the dirtiest, most fucked up part of my job."
5708,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like i should start off the year hating myself for being a dumb ass and selfish ass mother and all of the other negative things i said
5709,<|emo_disgust|> I hate Twitter
5710,<|emo_disgust|> You're saying [NAME] used dirty propaganda and dirty tactics to win the hearts and minds of people and win the heart of a child. He's a liar.
5711,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst I've ever seen. Could you imagine if [NAME] wasn't a [NAME] fan? It would get toned down so much.
5712,<|emo_disgust|> It should be illegal to post them there if they're a hate group though.
5713,"<|emo_disgust|> We all want to be loved, but that's just the drive of the psychopath."
5714,"<|emo_disgust|> And then you're waiting for a miracle to happen, wow this must be exhausting. "
5715,<|emo_disgust|> She was so wrong. I'm so sorry.
5716,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, not gonna lie! I appreciate the help!"
5718,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, damn!"
5719,"<|emo_disgust|> That doesn't make any sense. He's married, how his wife can divorce him..."
5720,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is on fire!!!
5721,<|emo_disgust|> Just look at that shit call....
5722,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] IS SO SORRY
5723,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] and [NAME] are not bad at QB tho.
5724,<|emo_disgust|> I think it's safe to say I've been a porn addict all of my life.
5726,<|emo_disgust|> I really despise [NAME]
5727,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, she really tried to tell the whole story... and now I have a video... WHAT??? "
5728,"<|emo_disgust|> What a complete and utter cunt, I am so sorry for your loss."
5729,<|emo_disgust|> Because they have to be ashamed of what they are doing to human lives.
5730,<|emo_disgust|> i want to be the one to tell her that i can be supportive when these things happen and give her advice
5731,"<|emo_disgust|> Because they aren't rich because they aren't getting rich, they were rich because their previous business failed then and they didn't fail."
5732,<|emo_disgust|> That’s a lot of karma!
5734,<|emo_disgust|> i feel as if im being stubborn and rebellious for another day
5735,<|emo_disgust|> This is me all the time and it’s terrible.
5736,"<|emo_disgust|> My goodness, she gave birth to three. You are a monster. "
5737,<|emo_disgust|> Who cares. You don’t care. Stop trying. It’s stupid and won’t change people’s minds.
5738,<|emo_disgust|> That is awful. I'm so sorry that you have to go through that.
5739,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow I still can't believe they actually named their game ""Fuck ThecapItUp""."
5740,<|emo_disgust|> That’s the worst I’ve ever seen
5741,<|emo_disgust|> The only bad thing that can be said about this is that you can take pictures with it without being disturbed
5742,<|emo_disgust|> This person did absolutely nothing wrong. Just an asshue to the fact that they can't quite bring themselves to admit there's something wrong with them.
5743,<|emo_disgust|> i was feeling very frustrated and frustrated that some of our supporters on social media didn t understand the points i was making here
5744,"<|emo_disgust|> The weird thing is, there's absolutely nothing illegal about posting them, and it's weird to be against internet standards for sharing them. "
5745,<|emo_disgust|> My husband has been a stay at home dad for a year and a half now and everytime he comes home to me I think I'm going to be with him until the day hedies
5746,"<|emo_disgust|> No, the fact that you care about another person's comfort is a problem. "
5748,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] I hate twitter
5749,<|emo_disgust|> You're ugly.
5751,<|emo_disgust|> It's so damn creepy
5753,<|emo_disgust|> Who could have figured that out by watching this entire thing? Wow
5754,<|emo_disgust|> No it’s not. What is scary is the idea that the government can ask the Big 3 to hand over their phones.
5756,<|emo_disgust|> My god this season has so many secrets. What about the birth of [NAME]?
5758,<|emo_disgust|> You're disgusting.
5760,"<|emo_disgust|> If you have kids with your current partner, you should divorce her and start over. She should never have touched you in the first place, and now you're trying to blame her for her behavior. "
5761,"<|emo_disgust|> The last issue might be the biggest! She was a student, which is to say she probably wasn't well informed and wouldn't have read what I opined on anyway!"
5762,<|emo_disgust|> I wish I had more up votes. I think your evidence for wanting the government off your back is pretty shaky.
5763,<|emo_disgust|> This is so creepy and disgusting. No one should act like this.
5764,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, your 18. Have fun growing up."
5766,<|emo_disgust|> People are the worst!
5767,<|emo_disgust|> The third picture is creepy.
5768,"<|emo_disgust|> I just hate the word ""vote"". Take your fucking upvote"
5769,<|emo_disgust|> I actually really do not know how you all are all this. My mind is blank. I think there is this weird divine connection to the three of you.
5770,<|emo_disgust|> It’s weird to look at
5771,"<|emo_disgust|> No it sounds strange, can't explain"
5774,<|emo_disgust|> That's a rather disgusting amount of Sesame oil.
5775,<|emo_disgust|> He is afraid to stand up for himself
5776,<|emo_disgust|> >[NAME] is a bit of a romantic [NAME] This is a good thing. I know they had a bit going on but this just sounds like an innocent fling in this situation.
5777,<|emo_disgust|> No that’s not right
5778,<|emo_disgust|> That's a nasty deflection.
5779,<|emo_disgust|> You seem horrible
5780,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, he lost more on the first play than [NAME] did last season combined"
5782,<|emo_disgust|> Who gave the order to fire the first shot? What's your evidence?
5783,<|emo_disgust|> Oh no you got it!
5785,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn son, I hate Twitter"
5787,"<|emo_disgust|> What a loser, sad. "
5788,"<|emo_disgust|> And the real joke is she would have accepted the deal if she knew it was a three year contract, how the hell not."
5789,<|emo_disgust|> The only good one here is r/childfree
5791,<|emo_disgust|> Worst than indecipherable texts!
5793,<|emo_disgust|> I didn't say it was bad.. I said it's annoying when you're trying to be rude..
5794,"<|emo_disgust|> What's wrong with taking care of your house properly and then calling this crap post a ""reactionary poem""?"
5795,<|emo_disgust|> This is bloody disgusting.
5796,<|emo_disgust|> This is what I thought too. You are unfortunately far to far off
5797,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, she sounds fucking awful."
5798,<|emo_disgust|> I had him arrested and tried putting him in a cell with other mentally ill People.
5799,<|emo_disgust|> That’s not a fucking card?! /s
5800,<|emo_disgust|> I was at the game and I was really pleased to see [NAME] and [NAME] shaking hands at the end
5801,<|emo_disgust|> And it’s worse
5802,<|emo_disgust|> This is horribly disgusting.
5803,<|emo_disgust|> i didnt feel like my wife was completely loyal to me and that is a big turn off for her
5804,<|emo_disgust|> Nowhere else would that be absolutely horrific
5806,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that he's a former neurosurgeon and didn't know neurosurgeons didn't make him any less awful to others.
5809,"<|emo_disgust|> When they come to visit and get shaken about something that isn't their fault, I hate them."
5810,<|emo_disgust|> This is kinda sad.
5811,"<|emo_disgust|> That'd be a terrible trade. I like the Kings, but this deal makes no sense"
5812,<|emo_disgust|> My mother tongue is ‘monosecrier’ but I‘m a girl so that’s just a stereotype’
5813,<|emo_disgust|> He’s horrible
5814,<|emo_disgust|> That’s disgusting...
5816,<|emo_disgust|> Why is she the worst
5817,"<|emo_disgust|> Sooooo... yeah. You get a pet cause you ask him to show up for work early. He shows up late. It's not a contract thing, mind you."
5818,<|emo_disgust|> He was probably drinking at the time.
5819,<|emo_disgust|> No I've been guilty of that. I'm just a horrible human being. Hope you recover quickly.
5820,<|emo_disgust|> i thought i may have gone a few hours without reading this because that's how i wanted it to feel because it was so good and everything i thought was coming out was wrong
5821,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not even a [NAME]. I'm a [RELIGION] [NAME] [NAME]. Get out now.
5822,<|emo_disgust|> She's worse than [NAME]! She sounds the same as her dad! They could probably make it up...
5823,<|emo_disgust|> What was the source? I read it on Reddit and was surprised to see it comes from some far-right think tank.
5824,<|emo_disgust|> What a disgusting pair of human beings.
5825,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so insulted and hurt and angry
5826,"<|emo_disgust|> The saddest thing is that while it’s lessened with age, it’s still worse."
5827,"<|emo_disgust|> >""I hate it when my boyfriend disobeys me"" I fucking love this."
5829,<|emo_disgust|> This kid should lose his job over this. Can’t be an LA County supervisor.
5830,<|emo_disgust|> The guy in the videos is probably a lot older than me. My first two jobs were roofing and plumbing so it wasnt that much different.
5831,<|emo_disgust|> I will absolutely go to Hell if I have to govote for any of these morons.
5832,<|emo_disgust|> I feel your pain. Please don't ever link this again.
5834,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] should be ashamed of himself for saying that.
5835,<|emo_disgust|> This looks like total garbage for the host though...
5836,<|emo_disgust|> Aaaand nobody got hurt because no one tried anything. Stop talking bullshit.
5837,<|emo_disgust|> Why should I look like that when I'm barely 5 foot 9
5838,<|emo_disgust|> i had one unfortunate episode in college where i didnt feel cool enough to go in and meet up with girls i didnt know any
5839,<|emo_disgust|> Now check this out- he's an idiot when it comes to politics.
5840,"<|emo_disgust|> There's a fine line between right and wrong, [NAME] crossed it."
5841,"<|emo_disgust|> No wonder there's so much hate for [NAME]. She's the one who sucks, dammit."
5842,<|emo_disgust|> That last bit about the sniffles being in his nose was more cringe than anything.
5843,<|emo_disgust|> It's like a violent parody of itself.
5844,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fucking BEAST
5845,"<|emo_disgust|> I hate when I see something and think ""it's a cake!"" "
5846,<|emo_disgust|> What a disgusting person [NAME] is she
5847,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is running out of ammo. Makes you feel so helpless.
5849,<|emo_disgust|> The reason I'm a horrible person is because of [NAME].
5850,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, these refs actually fucking hate us. "
5851,<|emo_disgust|> No hate TGR I'm just curious as to the current state of affairs
5852,<|emo_disgust|> Man I hate this.
5853,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm not against the NHL taking a shot at these kinds of things, they've been horrible for years"
5854,"<|emo_disgust|> It is honestly the worst, ugh."
5855,<|emo_disgust|> You think he'll ever get that out of us? I'm pretty sure he's gotten a kick at some point in his career at this point.
5856,<|emo_disgust|> Don't go around saying you don't care about anything unless you are actively trying to destroy it and ruining yourself
5857,<|emo_disgust|> No but it would get ridiculous real fast.
5858,<|emo_disgust|> So you're an actual fascist. Cool bruh
5859,"<|emo_disgust|> > You don't even like the tone. It's more ""fucking noob"""
5860,"<|emo_disgust|> I just know it’s bullshit, I hate CoD4 so much"
5861,<|emo_disgust|> The saddest part is how many places around the world actually have laws against child labor and still acceptugees
5862,<|emo_disgust|> What a stupidest idea
5863,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] does this. He's going to the Bengals in a few days....
5864,"<|emo_disgust|> Well that sucks good luck to you buddy, should have told you that. "
5866,<|emo_disgust|> No no but she hated him because he told her the truth
5867,"<|emo_disgust|> If the argument wasn't so strong, I would say you didn't have much to argue with."
5868,"<|emo_disgust|> The title of this post is pretty much accurate. I'm a very particular, intense atheist. I need help finding a therapist."
5869,"<|emo_disgust|> Ouch, seriously. The video is shaky, constant red-tape on and on. It's not a good look."
5870,"<|emo_disgust|> No, youre saying they don't have to have a specific reason to show up."
5872,"<|emo_disgust|> She's a horrible writer, terrible artist, and worst parent, somehow all at the same time."
5874,<|emo_disgust|> The fuck? That ball stayed in there?
5875,"<|emo_disgust|> This is the most obvious, meanest, and most disgusting thing I've seen on this subreddit today"
5876,"<|emo_disgust|> And yet, we still care about animals. It just shows how stupid and selfish humans are getting."
5878,<|emo_disgust|> This makes me want to die.
5880,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] a traitorous old bastard
5881,<|emo_disgust|> Lol hate that I can’t relate
5882,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]? I can’t hear you over your own obnoxious complain.
5883,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing that could possibly happen to him is another aggravated assault.
5884,<|emo_disgust|> i would love to share in their joy but i feel very violent right now
5888,<|emo_disgust|> We have people who are so evil they'd def shame entire school systems because they're so wrong.
5889,"<|emo_disgust|> Weirdly enough I still prefer the old hagelin system to this one...the players who played under him were awesome for sure, but it was just a matter as to which one I liked best."
5890,<|emo_disgust|> Your hair looks fucking horrible m8
5891,<|emo_disgust|> i feel kind of selfish for that
5893,<|emo_disgust|> It’s creepy to think of.
5895,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh no, that’s not quite right, sorry for the confusion."
5896,<|emo_disgust|> She is such a fucking dork.
5898,<|emo_disgust|> I like how [NAME] is the one who is the weird one here.
5899,<|emo_disgust|> I hope [NAME] is f**ked
5900,"<|emo_disgust|> Those comments are disgusting. Reminds me of something [NAME] said at a weigh ins this year. Btw, she is in her 30s!"
5901,"<|emo_disgust|> A friend of mine is aian and has the same thoughts as me, pretty sad honestly."
5902,"<|emo_disgust|> And the irony is she is the one who brought on the term ""alt-right"" by calling them alt-lives and pretend being born into a privileged family means you have no say in what your own wants are ever gonna be for you."
5903,<|emo_disgust|> If [NAME] was worse I'd be upset for the last 4 to 5 years
5906,"<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit, totally missed that. I’m sorry."
5907,<|emo_disgust|> Oh look a player breaking out of a slump by scoring 20+ on the first 2 quarters on a bad team
5908,"<|emo_disgust|> That’s what I hear too. I hate how many people in this thread are [RELIGION], [RELIGION]) and [RELIGION]."
5909,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, you have a very interesting take on the following:"
5911,<|emo_disgust|> That’s a terrible pass. Made him look indecisive man. Wtf is a weeb
5912,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Sonic boom"" sounds a little strange to me, but... ""Sonic boom"" sounds more like a movie script. "
5913,"<|emo_disgust|> How dare you! Out of all the gods in the universe, what are you unworthy to worship?! -[NAME]"
5914,<|emo_disgust|> She looks fucking awful for doing so.
5918,"<|emo_disgust|> No, it really is. That's the weird part."
5919,<|emo_disgust|> Fucked up.
5920,<|emo_disgust|> They were horrible together. [NAME] and [NAME] share many antediluvian nicknames.
5921,<|emo_disgust|> Soooo [NAME] and [NAME] are in it.
5922,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing that could make it worse is a torn ACL.
5924,<|emo_disgust|> Don't do the same when you are older
5925,<|emo_disgust|> I would also love to see [NAME] in the No Man's Sky mod.
5928,<|emo_disgust|> That’s pretty lewd. Disgusting...
5930,<|emo_disgust|> OOOOOF yes. She’s my girl crush.
5932,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh it was a bad one man, sorry mate"
5934,<|emo_disgust|> But people will still still choose the path of least resistance. It's sad but true lol
5935,<|emo_disgust|> He said yes. The date was a fling....
5937,<|emo_disgust|> He doesn't have a lot of fans.
5938,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch! My hear sank... Ouch!
5939,<|emo_disgust|> I hate it too. It’s the only job I would enjoy doing.
5940,<|emo_disgust|> This is so creepy. Good riddance.
5942,<|emo_disgust|> They have to get a job and leave the house in order to take care of the kids.
5943,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so fucking greedy now that i actually have something to give away to someone
5944,"<|emo_disgust|> ""That's not a gun!"" "" the fuck down"""
5945,<|emo_disgust|> Oh I know right? It's even worse when you're on a new device with no idea what's going on.
5946,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not getting this...
5947,<|emo_disgust|> Those who work with me atm probably come from games used to be extremely difficult. The original Doom definitely made this difficult.
5948,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling quite mad and irritated by it all
5949,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is trash and I love it
5951,<|emo_disgust|> I hate that I love him but I have to go back to season 1
5953,"<|emo_disgust|> The most disgusting, most cruel and most disgusting creature on this earth, but also one of the most compassionate and understanding human beings ever."
5954,<|emo_disgust|> He looks like the voice of [NAME].
5955,<|emo_disgust|> He was talking about the kids! The actual bad guy! The one with the scythe!
5956,<|emo_disgust|> Your just killing time now is impatient *cries in north america*
5957,<|emo_disgust|> What an idiot.
5958,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit that's horrible. A team that lost 5 of 6 on the road just because they hadn't scored on 10+of their own....
5959,<|emo_disgust|> That’s horrible. I wish you the best for tomorrow!
5960,<|emo_disgust|> The most annoying person on reddit right now is r/badpatrol
5962,"<|emo_disgust|> Not exactly sure I blame them, but yeah, the lack of variety is a real bummer."
5963,<|emo_disgust|> Why should I be surprised? He's the president. [NAME] is the lame duck.
5964,<|emo_disgust|> This is scary to know that you went through. People like this are a much bigger problem than I thought.
5965,<|emo_disgust|> I'm a danger to myself
5966,<|emo_disgust|> I can’t do that...I’m a woman and I’d rather just not have to deal with the penis envy.
5967,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is terrible
5969,<|emo_disgust|> It’s even worse when your friends tell you it’s a lie
5971,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]? He's a horrible writer, an awful actor, an awful host, and an awful human being. "
5973,<|emo_disgust|> It's a fucking disgusting meme.
5975,<|emo_disgust|> The most generic heroes I've ever seen. Like... any popular hero besides [NAME]
5976,<|emo_disgust|> The fact some middle schoolers are disgusted at [NAME] is pretty disturbing.
5977,<|emo_disgust|> He’s on something right now which is why he’s crying at the end of the game.
5978,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] and other liberals are disgusting.
5979,"<|emo_disgust|> This picture is a prime example why the Vancouver BC Canucks are bad, horribleucks "
5980,"<|emo_disgust|> The problem is that these guys on college campus are, by a lot, very loud, obnoxious, obnoxiousholes. "
5981,<|emo_disgust|> Those are some nasty teeth.
5982,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting. One has to wonder what was worse for your taste.
5984,"<|emo_disgust|> You can't just say ""I want to make a film about this"" and expect people to like it"
5985,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a scumbag.
5986,<|emo_disgust|> Those fucking tires
5987,<|emo_disgust|> I was going to say this but just because you said it doesn't mean it.
5988,"<|emo_disgust|> And yet, you complain that he sucks. Cool bruh"
5989,<|emo_disgust|> Now [NAME] is bad
5990,"<|emo_disgust|> I mean, this is the top-rated news video on YouTube right now. How much hate can you get?"
5992,"<|emo_disgust|> There’s no point in this. He already used his power and influence to bully those who bullied him, it’s petty to be complaining about someone who bullied you."
5994,<|emo_disgust|> Just because it's a violent game doesn't mean we have to kill every other guy.
5995,<|emo_disgust|> We are not talking about your average college kid either
5996,<|emo_disgust|> What in the fuck is the deal for? I love my alts but I hate [NAME] in particular...
5997,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME], I would have hated not being able to get that trade when we were at the bottom of the mountain."
5998,<|emo_disgust|> I'm a risk taker and a donator.... should be able to pay what is due and you can tell me what to do with the rest... how is this different
5999,"<|emo_disgust|> And it's just ""some people"" you douchebag, not ""[NAME] is bad"" you fucking idiot."
6001,<|emo_disgust|> Weird way to spell [NAME] but it's the same damn spell
6002,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing that could ever happen to me is him killing me.
6003,"<|emo_disgust|> Not even mad about the original posting, but damn you for sharing the article. I'd like to think the dude is still mad about it..."
6004,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst FO in Orlando magic history
6006,<|emo_disgust|> You need to get your act together. No-fucking-likes until you get your act together.
6009,<|emo_disgust|> You will enjoy wearing out this week.
6011,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, fuck [NAME] even more."
6013,<|emo_disgust|> i feel a bit strange writing this now as i only went into it a little ago but when i did it wasnt for nothing
6014,<|emo_disgust|> Just the name of it gives me anxiety
6015,"<|emo_disgust|> There is this, people will die because of this"
6016,<|emo_disgust|> i feel all tortured mad mad and sad
6017,<|emo_disgust|> The real worst thing she said was: “I hate you and your “girlfriend” ways.”
6018,<|emo_disgust|> That's worse...the content is back to normal then
6019,<|emo_disgust|> I've started to hate [NAME] and I'm only 16
6020,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is the worst owner in bull history. Not to mention, he's far and few between"
6021,<|emo_disgust|> The most horrific thing I have ever seen
6022,<|emo_disgust|> Well I hope so because I hate the people that play them...I just don’t like doing them
6023,<|emo_disgust|> It's not even illegal to bully people. It's actually a type of speech. What the hell is wrong with you.
6024,"<|emo_disgust|> So your posts are a hateful, racist diatribe then?"
6025,"<|emo_disgust|> If that’s true, it’s terrible news for the rest of the league"
6026,<|emo_disgust|> I hate it too. I just can't.
6027,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, it's just dumb, like, how you have people commenting downvote posts like this (for a change)"
6028,<|emo_disgust|> A lot of people are mad at him but I never saw him angry or anything. It's always seems peaceful and calm.
6029,<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest part is the shirt he is wearing.
6030,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] looks freakin' horrible today
6031,"<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting, and honestly pretty frightening that her dad's administration is allowing it to happen."
6032,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing stronger than this comment is my hatred for [NAME] for allowing himself to be treated this way.
6035,<|emo_disgust|> I don't care about [NAME] story... I've watched enough reality shows to know that won't happen. There are enough sad people on this earth that have it easier than this!
6037,<|emo_disgust|> So? We all love our childbrain president and all. But the country will somehow be worse off because of his/hers decisions!
6039,<|emo_disgust|> This is so creepy. Good riddance to horrible rubbish.
6040,<|emo_disgust|> The absolute worst!
6041,<|emo_disgust|> No but the media itself is an absolute nightmare
6042,<|emo_disgust|> I didn't know it would be that simple...
6043,<|emo_disgust|> It was so sad to watch
6044,<|emo_disgust|> You would be far more disturbing if you did
6045,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I just came across your post and I didn't know what to say thank you reddit!
6046,<|emo_disgust|> Those cheeks!
6047,"<|emo_disgust|> They can't help it, it's the one who hates freedom...the state"
6048,<|emo_disgust|> We will not be making any decisions until after marriage is over. Unless it is a matter of our children's lives. You better find some cause.
6049,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't think you're wrong, but I'd point you in the wrong direction if you had."
6050,<|emo_disgust|> This is the weirdest thing I've seen on this sub this week
6051,<|emo_disgust|> I'm so tired I almost want to pass out.
6052,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck so obvious I’d be surprised if he likes it.
6053,<|emo_disgust|> I think everyone forgot about the zigzag thing. I think [NAME] himself was just understating the case because he said it was probably less than.1%
6055,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Oh [NAME] I wronged you man."""
6056,<|emo_disgust|> i am a bit too impatient to wait to find out what was going to happen or give any indication as to what was going to happen after the title text is seen
6057,<|emo_disgust|> It's not racist at all. It's just another example of him being a racist.
6058,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, that's a lot of karma."
6060,<|emo_disgust|> It's even worse than I thought. Your ex wife is still your parent. You should get legal advice
6061,<|emo_disgust|> This was one of the worst commentators I have ever been forced to listen to. A class A moron.
6062,<|emo_disgust|> Oh god [NAME] what was that
6063,<|emo_disgust|> My favorite is when [NAME] talks about how it makes him a boy while the girls on his arm growl: “The world”s a cruel place.
6064,<|emo_disgust|> That was an illegal-as-hell pass. I have no idea what [NAME] saw.
6065,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn you, I’m on the receiving end of a similar scam right now"
6066,<|emo_disgust|> Oh the horror.
6067,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that nobody posted anything to complain about that doesn’t stop people from going on about their lives about.. about getting fucked.
6068,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I find Reddit so fascinating.
6069,<|emo_disgust|> I've been to a few places in Arizona/UT. No bathrooms there. Tried to get a ride home. Bummer.
6070,<|emo_disgust|> I’m so ashamed that you made such a terrible list. 🤢
6072,<|emo_disgust|> It's one thing to disagree with [RELIGION] on some issues. It's quite another to argue that there ARE wrongdoings in the religion.
6073,<|emo_disgust|> I'm so fucking greedy I'll eat trash right now.
6074,"<|emo_disgust|> My god, [NAME]!"
6076,<|emo_disgust|> I'm just sad about your cats. Good thing I didn't have to ask them to be so gross...
6078,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is scary as hell
6079,<|emo_disgust|> He's a very obvious [NAME] reference as well
6081,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is fucking destroying Bama and I honestly cannot believe I have to defend a program I love just because someone from reddit hates it.
6084,<|emo_disgust|> Who cares? You're a whiny middle-aged woman writing a blog about having a baby. Stop crying.
6085,<|emo_disgust|> Because my husband is getting fired and we're all going to be drunk in the morning.
6089,<|emo_disgust|> I hate my life
6091,<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest thing I've seen on Reddit in a while.
6092,<|emo_disgust|> That last laugh was amazing
6093,<|emo_disgust|> There is no such thing as freedom in the U.S.
6094,<|emo_disgust|> It's been one month and already it’s getting worse. My water is filthy looking.
6095,<|emo_disgust|> This kid needs to be reported to the police. This needs to be a hate crime.
6096,<|emo_disgust|> It's a lot of effort to get three kills out of two people
6097,"<|emo_disgust|> So yeah, so many people have this terrible idea. It's just never occurred to me that it's so awful - like, I knew of literally people who had this idea, and it's horrifying! "
6098,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a racist!!!
6100,"<|emo_disgust|> How is this not child abuse. I see your point, I just don't agree. "
6101,<|emo_disgust|> This is the saddest post I've read today
6102,<|emo_disgust|> I swear Denver has the worst sports media personalities.
6103,<|emo_disgust|> Oh my [NAME] I almost forgot about that!
6104,<|emo_disgust|> No wonder he's scared of flying
6105,<|emo_disgust|> This looks sick
6106,"<|emo_disgust|> You see that? She was probably abused in some way way. You're just an ""us"" in that."
6108,<|emo_disgust|> You mean they've all got pretty fucked up reputations already.
6109,<|emo_disgust|> My advice is pretty straight forward. Stay away from him and his circle of assholes.
6111,<|emo_disgust|> I'm literally frantic right now trying to figure out what's wrong.
6112,<|emo_disgust|> Who got diarrhea from that?
6113,<|emo_disgust|> Omg! That was straight up reckless
6114,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, she didn't even give it [NAME] okay. Just gotta get out there asap!"
6115,"<|emo_disgust|> The whole world is watching, because someone will callously invade another country and grab control over part of the population without any remorse whatsoever. "
6116,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I want to say I'm sorry, but apparently not. Oh well"""
6117,<|emo_disgust|> That is the worst defense we have.
6119,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you use words that reference mental illness...you're a freak.
6120,"<|emo_disgust|> In the words of [NAME], be ready if they are."
6121,<|emo_disgust|> I'm so disgusted that a company that caters to the mega rich would make a video about a tip jar. That is just disgusting.
6123,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, fuck ya but the sun isn't going to shine tomorrow afternoon either. So that'll be a extra vacation day from work..."
6124,<|emo_disgust|> She reminds me of some of the worst characters in Jojo.
6126,<|emo_disgust|> That was straight up reckless.
6127,<|emo_disgust|> It’s literally the worst announcers you’ll ever hear. I can’t imagine doing anything worse
6128,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird, I read it like 1/3rd off."
6129,<|emo_disgust|> The guy was actually quite racist and sexist.
6130,<|emo_disgust|> That is absolutely disgusting.
6131,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah you're right. Some women are just truly mad.
6133,<|emo_disgust|> Not the slightest bit creepy.
6134,"<|emo_disgust|> I would go on a vegan fast for a week! It's miserable. I still get famine every day, but I'm much happier doing it."
6135,<|emo_disgust|> How do I post a video? What format do I post it in?
6136,<|emo_disgust|> They are probably getting a lot of the blame for that either way.
6138,<|emo_disgust|> Who said I hated him? I totally do. He's one of the best support characters in Fire Emblem.
6139,<|emo_disgust|> What's the source? I love this.
6141,<|emo_disgust|> That was disgusting. VWP
6142,<|emo_disgust|> Man I hate that song so much
6143,<|emo_disgust|> The last thing I wanted was a high school bully.
6144,<|emo_disgust|> I was in tears reading this. WTF is wrong with people?!
6145,<|emo_disgust|> People who hate [NAME] for years afterwards still don't understand that
6146,<|emo_disgust|> You are right. I’m terrible at saying no but now I’m terrible at saying yes
6147,<|emo_disgust|> I think it goes back to the worst kind of media harrasing.
6148,<|emo_disgust|> That's too many pills
6149,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a vicious little cat
6150,<|emo_disgust|> It’s pretty cringe
6151,<|emo_disgust|> It makes me feel like a child.
6152,<|emo_disgust|> You’re a disgusting piece
6153,<|emo_disgust|> i feel absolutely fucked up physically
6154,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh I don't see it, but I'll try to watch it anyway."
6155,<|emo_disgust|> How dare she have a relationship with a man!aggressively tells you she loves you and you're a horrible person for dating him!
6156,<|emo_disgust|> Just say the n-word
6157,<|emo_disgust|> That’s an unpleasant wake up call. Can you imagine if that happened to you?
6158,"<|emo_disgust|> In which case, I’m sorry. Was just in hopes that it’s nothing. "
6160,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is what started it all... the worst purest OG Atleti player ever.
6161,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird, they seem to have a lot of crossover fans."
6162,<|emo_disgust|> You have one foot in the grave here and the other foot is the right religion.
6163,<|emo_disgust|> > he had a bizarre obsession with the idea that he was somehow redeemable despite what he had done. Well....
6164,<|emo_disgust|> Don't you shame us for being terrorists.
6165,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] fucking stop overwatching.
6166,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck this. Why do I love reddit so much?
6167,<|emo_disgust|> The saddest thing about this video is that it's directly inspired by /r/SickLeAFers
6168,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, that could be a real thing, and sucks for you, but okay then..."
6170,<|emo_disgust|> This guy was too fast for his own good. That would of fucked up him up.
6171,<|emo_disgust|> Why would they? You've seen them with their legs spread in the picture. A gross photo.
6172,<|emo_disgust|> It looks weird
6173,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn. That didn't sound right at all, did it?"
6174,"<|emo_disgust|> No, as a matter-of-fact-I've never heard of this before. Very weird."
6175,<|emo_disgust|> I was looking up how [NAME] has fucked up with regards to women. I mean fucked up.
6177,<|emo_disgust|> Oh no it’s not. It seems like an obvious irritant but I hate it too.
6178,"<|emo_disgust|> If you're saying it's a bad thing to say, this guy is one of the worst."
6179,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, I don't think everyone is that stupid."
6180,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is an awful defender.
6181,"<|emo_disgust|> Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go do my homework first."""
6182,<|emo_disgust|> Now that's some fucking bullshit
6184,"<|emo_disgust|> Your dog is so fat, he could eat a tree log!"
6185,<|emo_disgust|> What does that even mean? It is just a list of things everyone says they don't regret.
6186,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, poor poor [NAME]"
6187,<|emo_disgust|> Not at all. I had this one. Still hurts to watch.
6189,<|emo_disgust|> Your entire character is based on a stereotype. Who the fuck cares.
6190,<|emo_disgust|> A guy who knows nothing about law but just wants to point out how stupid and/or mean-spirited some of his comments are should probably check out a tad bit before acting like a law student.
6191,<|emo_disgust|> You’re wrong about [NAME] and [NAME] being bad together is the worst thing that can be said.
6192,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst argument ever. Who in the actual fuck cares? Stop saying it just because it sounds bad.
6193,"<|emo_disgust|> You will, sadly, die a virgin."
6194,<|emo_disgust|> Holy crap!
6195,"<|emo_disgust|> This man was beyond cringe worthy, it was creepy"
6196,<|emo_disgust|> That's so creepy. Good riddance to awful rubbish. :(
6197,<|emo_disgust|> Who can forget that horrendous stretch? Scary.
6198,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird we didn't see any of these guys in the video tbh
6199,<|emo_disgust|> This is so creepy. Good riddance to awfulness.
6200,<|emo_disgust|> Just call the cops and say you'reagediscrimination. Maybe they'll listen but only after some months??
6201,<|emo_disgust|> Holy cow that was fucking bad...
6202,<|emo_disgust|> That is just incredibly creepy and weird. I find it a lot more disturbing that she's sharing that.
6203,<|emo_disgust|> And you've got a wife who hates your guts and guts alone
6204,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] this is so infuriating
6205,<|emo_disgust|> Because that's what the law requires. And I hate the hate.
6206,<|emo_disgust|> It's not even a test! It's a wakeup call!
6207,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, what a bizarre post omg"
6208,"<|emo_disgust|> Because he is a potential serial killer, or an elected official who has lied or cheated in office."
6210,<|emo_disgust|> How awful. [NAME] is only bad if you're a redstatene who hates [NAME].
6211,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a disgusting insecure piece of shit
6212,<|emo_disgust|> The thing that is most disgusting to see is the inside of a manger.
6213,<|emo_disgust|> You get the worst of both worlds. Attributing blame on innocent people is wrong.
6215,<|emo_disgust|> I don't get it. What the actual FUCK is [NAME] doing? What a waste of a roster spot.
6216,<|emo_disgust|> And he's not the only one who has had his career ended by injuries. [NAME] has had 16 separated from him.
6217,<|emo_disgust|> Wow. Can you imagine having to sign that? I think you could abuse it.
6218,<|emo_disgust|> It's really hard to look at. It's like a horrible screenshot you can't turn away from.
6219,<|emo_disgust|> No! How dare you! It is all your fault that they're all together! Just get out of here with this nonsense!
6220,<|emo_disgust|> You don’t get to decide what is funny without your parents' knowledge! Now go back to living in your own world!
6221,<|emo_disgust|> You’re disgusting.
6222,<|emo_disgust|> I was skeptical about the toothpick thing too
6223,<|emo_disgust|> It’s not [Bold] or [ Italic] but I think it’s definitely wrong.
6224,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]? Yeah, he’s weird"
6225,<|emo_disgust|> Lol that’s so incredibly creepy and disgusting. No wonder she’s a porn star.
6226,"<|emo_disgust|> Well that sucks. He is a douchebag, though."
6227,<|emo_disgust|> There is also the issue of them not wanting the money but trusting him
6228,<|emo_disgust|> I just want to be friends not hate them
6229,<|emo_disgust|> He was terrible for us
6230,<|emo_disgust|> I have a feeling [NAME] will go for a two-day absence because [NAME] is pissed.
6232,"<|emo_disgust|> It's weird to see both sides of an issue, doesn't it?"
6233,<|emo_disgust|> How did we get [NAME] away from us??? That sucks! We need to get [NAME] back on the forward line
6234,<|emo_disgust|> My dad died a little girl ago of bubonic plague - she was only 14
6235,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing they are doing is asking you to put your arms behind your back...
6236,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, *my* [NAME]!"
6237,"<|emo_disgust|> I feel bad for him, but honestly this is the first time I’ve ever backed a party that backtracks by far and wide."
6238,<|emo_disgust|> She is using her posts as a platform to get attention and be a part of society which is disgusting.
6239,<|emo_disgust|> It's more of an opinion than anything. I'm just aghast at the amount of hate that some people have for our current political situation.
6240,<|emo_disgust|> I am mad at you for wanting to know what my crush is.
6241,<|emo_disgust|> This is horrifying. I loved [NAME] but she's just barely gotten worse.
6243,<|emo_disgust|> It's as if he's ignorant about almost everything.
6244,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn I know so many people here have said that, but I really wanted to see some reaction to that comment. "
6245,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] I forgot about the [NAME] story
6246,<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry. But I'm not.
6248,"<|emo_disgust|> This sounds like the kind of thing a horror fan would say, and I hate it. "
6249,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn that’s a great question. I’m really trying to get into them but I’m really only seeing support, so I can’t ask too much."
6250,<|emo_disgust|> You must be miserable.
6251,<|emo_disgust|> That’s... very disgusting.
6254,<|emo_disgust|> The worst part is that there are still people out there who will find it funny and think it's a rip off.
6255,<|emo_disgust|> I have a lot of weird feelings about [NAME] too.
6256,<|emo_disgust|> It just seems that way...
6257,<|emo_disgust|> They were also the only ones that wanted to watch it anyway so it was a no brainer.
6258,"<|emo_disgust|> It’s worse when the movie version of it is a satire. Like inideas, ideas of [NAME] pissing his pants, etc. "
6259,"<|emo_disgust|> This isn't a ""when this happens"" post."
6260,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that half the country believe and say that [NAME] are saints is pretty disturbing.
6263,<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck has been going through my brain lately? /s
6264,<|emo_disgust|> People are very complicated.
6265,<|emo_disgust|> Damn [NAME]! Is THAT him?!
6266,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has been a horrible presence on the Canucks bottom 6 for a good part of the season. Now they have Gaborik gone. Who will replace him?
6267,<|emo_disgust|> And now my anxiety!
6269,<|emo_disgust|> i almost feel guilty saying that but i think i need to be more open with people who make me uncomfortable
6270,<|emo_disgust|> You know [NAME] never said those things? Look him up.
6271,<|emo_disgust|> I hate people who put things in their car while driving. It's ridiculous.
6272,<|emo_disgust|> i do believe there is an element of chance for me to do what i do but when the story is told it is quite often what i would have done
6276,<|emo_disgust|> That's a shame. I'm a big fan of his.
6277,<|emo_disgust|> I am a big fan of his work but this is dumb. Do we really give a shit about player safety more than a few years ago?
6278,<|emo_disgust|> Now look at that asshole
6280,<|emo_disgust|> I'm saying it's racist.
6281,<|emo_disgust|> i feel the most pissed off
6282,"<|emo_disgust|> She is a war criminal, if not worse."
6283,<|emo_disgust|> The worst has to be working with dealerships
6284,"<|emo_disgust|> That makes no sense, I hate sports because they're fake"
6285,<|emo_disgust|> I hate when people call me [NAME].
6286,<|emo_disgust|> I’m so hungry now
6287,"<|emo_disgust|> You're taking something very precious from me, and using it to pleasure yourself"
6288,<|emo_disgust|> i feel that we are doomed to repeat what we did last year and the same thing will happen again in 2019 that will have us all screaming bloody murder
6289,"<|emo_disgust|> My brother is a cop. If he saw that, he would run like heck."
6291,<|emo_disgust|> This is a horrible idea
6292,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Dude got lucky"" ""Fuck ya"""
6293,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that anyone thinks this is funny is disgusting.
6294,<|emo_disgust|> I hate it too. But I have no other options.
6295,<|emo_disgust|> That is the single worst pass block% in football
6296,"<|emo_disgust|> Who said I hated him? He just needs to ""settle"" with them..."
6297,"<|emo_disgust|> My point exactly. This shit makes me sad/angry sometimes, it's why I don’t do drugs. "
6299,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is pretty fucking scary
6300,"<|emo_disgust|> It's the ""in"" people dying from polio that's the problem, the ""outsourced"" government workers are the problem, and the ""state"" itself is a problem, not a choice "
6301,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] a piece of shit
6302,<|emo_disgust|> She really needs a boyfriend... :(
6303,"<|emo_disgust|> This is one of the biggest flaws I have with Reddit. I’m constantly brigaded, it makes me hate it so much."
6308,<|emo_disgust|> It’s also the reason why I hate [NAME] so much
6309,<|emo_disgust|> i feel a little strange saying that
6310,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] that is the worst I've ever seen
6313,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Poop hole""? WUT?"""
6314,"<|emo_disgust|> What, again? Your been paying attention to this thread for awhile, haven't you? Now you're upset is a racist name. We all cringe at racist names."
6315,<|emo_disgust|> Now you're talking about [NAME] which hashed out a lot of issues with the NURSE community. What a fucking bullshit and PR stunt by the organization.
6316,"<|emo_disgust|> He has a weird ""feeling the bubonic plague from his throat"""
6317,<|emo_disgust|> That is so disgusting. Im disgusted that anyone in their right mind would say that.
6318,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a greedy little shit and I’m glad he’s a shitty artist.
6320,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm with you, pulju has been terrible this week im definitely not pleased"
6321,"<|emo_disgust|> People are disgusting, insane and BOTH make a world of difference."
6322,"<|emo_disgust|> I will never forget the last time I felt truly disgusted by something. That was the last meal I ate in animal form. Thanks, bacon. "
6324,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], you are horrible"
6325,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I'm glad they weren't pointing their guns at each other for no reason
6326,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch. What a violent cunt.
6327,"<|emo_disgust|> No, I’m not talking about rape or any other form of sexual assault"
6328,<|emo_disgust|> Well fuck I’m sitting in position 3 right now so I hope you’re ok
6329,<|emo_disgust|> Man wtf. They are aghast at this post
6330,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, I don’t, at least not right now."
6331,<|emo_disgust|> Just take it easy son. He hasn’t been in the league long enough to lose all his skills on the offensive end like [NAME] did to the Pittsburgh Steelers.
6332,"<|emo_disgust|> He’s been bad for us at just about every skill position we have. Stop using him, it’s hopeless. "
6333,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, the comments are coming thick and fast, this sub is losing its goddamn mind.."
6334,<|emo_disgust|> I find it most surprising that [NAME] seems to have a somewhat dim view of porn.
6335,<|emo_disgust|> It's hard to be a woman in the military. Especially when people say mean things about your appearance.
6337,"<|emo_disgust|> No, it is all very well said and it really is sad that people think that hate or suggestion of hate (in whatever form) is ever not acceptable"
6338,<|emo_disgust|> i would say this was rude to her because she was still mad at me with me telling her i wasn t and had a crush on her
6339,<|emo_disgust|> Wow so obnoxious. I love it.
6341,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] how do you post a picture without the pic being automaticallyammy?
6342,<|emo_disgust|> This is horrible... One of my worst nightmares actually came true here in Arizona.
6343,<|emo_disgust|> I just don’t like him. And I’d like to see him play instead of [NAME]. [NAME] is a better player
6344,<|emo_disgust|> And now I'm eating shit
6345,"<|emo_disgust|> They're right, this is what's scariest. People on Reddit don't like being wrong 90% of the time so the 95% of things that make them upset are basically noise."
6346,<|emo_disgust|> He wants our foreign money to pay for his fancy hotels so he can complain about how terrible we are on balance.
6348,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit this was bad
6349,<|emo_disgust|> i feel greedy and stupid enough to buy a used car without knowing how to insurance it
6350,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fucking monster.
6352,<|emo_disgust|> You get a bad grade from a group of peers that you were not a part of before. Tell them
6353,"<|emo_disgust|> You’re going to hate a lot of people for sure, but I think that says a lot about your character. Also, he has more luck than [NAME], but [NAME] is a far better liar."
6354,<|emo_disgust|> This is like the worst meme format in the history of meme formats.
6355,<|emo_disgust|> You can't say that about 10% of the country.
6356,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I always get sad when I see kids on Reddit saying that.
6357,<|emo_disgust|> Nowhere on the album do you state that he’s been in your loans default history. This is an incredibly vital part of anyone trying to sue the guy.
6358,<|emo_disgust|> She’s an awful debater.
6360,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a disgusting host.
6362,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah. The only thing that makes this post worse is how many people agree with it.
6363,"<|emo_disgust|> So you're a disgusting piece of shit, huh?"
6365,"<|emo_disgust|> I would also say: Don’t hold me to this. Stay away from [NAME] and [NAME], they don’t offer much on the offensive end and are very frustrating."
6366,<|emo_disgust|> That's horrible. One of my favorite episodes.
6367,<|emo_disgust|> You sound angry.
6368,<|emo_disgust|> It would get really weird and all the chairs would have weird backsides
6369,<|emo_disgust|> I hope they pull a [NAME] and send him back a gift of $100 bill.
6370,<|emo_disgust|> i wanted to know if i was really feeling so fucked up that i hated my job and thought maybe i should just take it and leave
6372,<|emo_disgust|> Not only do we not want the mums revenge but she's such a strong little girl who just wants to be left alone
6373,<|emo_disgust|> She got it too.
6374,"<|emo_disgust|> He was going for an even scarier ""douchebag"" vibe. I can’t imagine being that unattractive."
6375,<|emo_disgust|> The lack of any sympathy for her is incredible
6376,"<|emo_disgust|> You've done a horrible, terrible thing."
6377,<|emo_disgust|> It is the worst when the complainants have no shred of proof for their claims and only rely on what they mouth because it fits their narrative.
6378,<|emo_disgust|> I feel so selfish admitting this but I love my little sister. I wish I could get that off my chest.
6379,<|emo_disgust|> People are people. And sometimes things are just a matter of opinion. It happened to her...
6380,"<|emo_disgust|> ""You have failed the test, therefore you fail the test."" "
6381,<|emo_disgust|> Just make sure no blood is coming out of his asshole.
6382,<|emo_disgust|> There is a difference between saying you had bad luck and blaming the luck on nature.
6383,<|emo_disgust|> The secondhand panic and embarrassment I feel from this is overwhelming
6384,<|emo_disgust|> i feel really weird about having that thought in my head right now while writing this post
6386,<|emo_disgust|> We still have that problem with racist gun laws though.
6387,"<|emo_disgust|> And so is yours. Take that as you will, but you still have the right to say no."
6388,<|emo_disgust|> That’s so creepy. Imagine if a dog ate your garbage. Would that be fair?
6389,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird, noCP is a worse option for libertarians."
6390,<|emo_disgust|> Damn..
6391,<|emo_disgust|> No wonder there's no law against it. We're just fucking around.
6392,<|emo_disgust|> That guy is gross
6394,<|emo_disgust|> Don't you know? People do this all the time. You're a weirdo.
6395,"<|emo_disgust|> The fact that you think like this is disturbing enough, but the second you mention your obsession with [NAME] is even more disturbing."
6396,<|emo_disgust|> This is so creepy. Good riddance!
6397,<|emo_disgust|> I got all sentimental about this last week. I got to spend a weekend at the beach with my sweet boy. It was seriously awesome. 
6398,<|emo_disgust|> i feel cold a lot
6400,<|emo_disgust|> The most obnoxious [NAME] fan I've ever seen.
6401,<|emo_disgust|> I'm just going to say it: Fuck this [NAME] trade.
6402,<|emo_disgust|> You're just a dumbass for calling out his racism and hateful comments. Stop being angry!
6404,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm just making crazy generalizations here. It isn't like there's 4 of them, all equally bad."
6405,<|emo_disgust|> Why do all the animals look horrifically wrong?
6406,<|emo_disgust|> The comment was so terrible it's worth pointing out.
6407,"<|emo_disgust|> It’s very normal that a person hates their job, their place in life, their parents, their community, everything that they care about."
6409,"<|emo_disgust|> I’ve never heard of this before, I’d be surprised to learn more about this... Thanks!"
6410,"<|emo_disgust|> Don't read into any of it too much, the dude was a little pissed off after the first fight especially since her last fight with [NAME] was a close third."
6411,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't think they're ugly, just that they look awful on most people."
6412,"<|emo_disgust|> And people still call them ""deplorable"" and ""morons""."
6413,<|emo_disgust|> There [NAME] is a serious health risk from his performance
6414,"<|emo_disgust|> If there was a ""for your convenience"" button it would take you literally nothing to click it."
6415,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, for the love of [NAME] stopagging people on Reddit and trying to be so friendly to everyone on the planet! "
6416,<|emo_disgust|> She has literally no self-control and is constantly proven wrong.
6417,"<|emo_disgust|> Don't use social media to get attention, it's a scam"
6419,<|emo_disgust|> He wants to go get the best deal for the Colts in free agency and trade anyway... So how dare you!/s
6420,<|emo_disgust|> This is one of the reasons I left the industry. This is horrible.
6422,"<|emo_disgust|> This is the most terrifying shitpost I've seen today. Please make this a daily thread, I literally can't process this any other way."
6423,<|emo_disgust|> How does it feel to literally be on fire every single day? It's damn exhausting!
6425,"<|emo_disgust|> And you've ever heard of the ""right"" to be a ""second class citizen"" when talking to the police? How ludicrous."
6426,"<|emo_disgust|> Thats absolutely insane, Im so sorry for your friend."
6427,<|emo_disgust|> This is what I think... people that hate on [NAME] because they don't like his work... are hypocrisy and self centered.
6428,<|emo_disgust|> Oh look the new intro song.
6429,<|emo_disgust|> i just feel very stressed out
6430,<|emo_disgust|> That's a lot of dirty words.
6433,<|emo_disgust|> My husband is exactly this. I hate it.
6435,<|emo_disgust|> The only good thing to come out of [NAME] is [NAME]
6436,<|emo_disgust|> That’s weird. What country is that?
6437,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, [NAME] is on fire! "
6439,<|emo_disgust|> You're a disgusting and ignorant piece.
6440,"<|emo_disgust|> No, it really is that simple. I've always been told to shut up by angry young men, no matter how young, without knowing any better. "
6441,<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell thinks he isn’t remorseful
6443,<|emo_disgust|> It's kinda sad that most of the online game communities are basically run by alt accounts.
6444,"<|emo_disgust|> The only one making sense is [NAME] and the racist, sexist, homophobic, ableist hate group he leads."
6445,<|emo_disgust|> The only one who will miss out is [NAME] because they are already paying [NAME] for a year contract.
6447,<|emo_disgust|> But I thought they were nasty animals
6449,"<|emo_disgust|> It’s hard to explain, it just sounds awful."
6450,<|emo_disgust|> He's bad because any Republican president wouldn't have signed the act if it had been in place back when he was in office.
6451,<|emo_disgust|> That makes me want to die
6452,<|emo_disgust|> You just posted the same thing but again targeting women.
6453,<|emo_disgust|> i get annoyed by this feeling that he is somehow inadequate and i think it may be self serve
6454,<|emo_disgust|> Man I hate Twitter
6455,"<|emo_disgust|> How dare you, it's gold!"
6456,<|emo_disgust|> It will probably just become trendy among weirdos to say that fascism is the new left.
6457,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking hate [NAME]!!!
6460,<|emo_disgust|> i can feel my skin start to get all hot and irritated
6461,"<|emo_disgust|> We are talking about the same issues here. A young woman, who could kill and possibly cause a lot of harm to others while she was young."
6462,<|emo_disgust|> My goodness. Take my UPvote.
6463,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, damn."
6468,"<|emo_disgust|> No, but it is so damn uncomfortable when I do."
6471,<|emo_disgust|> Oh I hate that too
6473,<|emo_disgust|> I feel horrible for her brother
6474,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fucking creeper
6475,<|emo_disgust|> They had so much worse luck atleast. That’s good.
6476,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was a great player for us but is he a better player for us now? Like, damn he should. "
6477,"<|emo_disgust|> And there we have it, the true history of the New World, complete with brutality, slavery, rape and the killing of native peoples."
6478,"<|emo_disgust|> I do enjoy the torture of the dentist. Dental sucks for you, though."
6479,<|emo_disgust|> Don't ever tell me what to do.
6482,"<|emo_disgust|> It really hurts, I would've rushed out there and given it to them haha"
6483,<|emo_disgust|> No I’m not. You’re disgusting and an awful human being.
6484,<|emo_disgust|> I don’t want it but I’m willing
6485,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn it I’m getting old
6486,<|emo_disgust|> >[NAME] is still a horrible option. Go ahead and let [NAME] do it though.
6487,<|emo_disgust|> The reason for this question is because I've seen several players say they hated playing without him when they were younger...
6488,"<|emo_disgust|> It's not even the fault of the person you're blaming, it's the companies fault for being so greedy...."
6489,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, at least her mum didn't give a damn"
6490,<|emo_disgust|> It was worse than first thought.
6491,"<|emo_disgust|> I can’t stand people crying [NAME] was terrible for us, I think he did a really good job. "
6492,<|emo_disgust|> I've always been a guy and hated it so much that I started wearing women's clothes because I hated feeling the need to cover up my body.
6494,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, [NAME] has been awful lately and its killing us here at r/LazyMan"
6495,"<|emo_disgust|> He’s a terrible, terrible man"
6496,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, that's some weed you're talking about."
6497,<|emo_disgust|> What abou yassss
6498,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing worse than a nuke is a satanic cross.
6499,"<|emo_disgust|> That was really weird, I’m so glad nothing happened to him. I hope you’re doing OK now."
6500,"<|emo_disgust|> The saddest part is, they all think they know what they're talking about. ""Allergy specialists"". ""osomics"". "
6501,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah the guy just doesn’t give a damn about the law and politics.
6502,<|emo_disgust|> i don t feel particularly bitter towards christians
6504,"<|emo_disgust|> I mean, you know, this country was started by people who were basically slaves in the south. "
6505,<|emo_disgust|> Well said. I'm just mad at how much of a selfish asshole she is.
6506,"<|emo_disgust|> I was too distracted by my phone, ruining everything around me"
6507,<|emo_disgust|> i hate seeing so many people complain about these kinds of people but im really just being honest here with you
6508,<|emo_disgust|> When I was in grade 8 I remember seeing a child psychologist once telling us how much he loved being sick.
6509,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you not find domestic abuse funny!!! /s
6510,<|emo_disgust|> I miss his dunks.
6511,"<|emo_disgust|> It’s one of my favorite [NAME] stories, if you’re wondering"
6512,"<|emo_disgust|> Not to be taken literally, but yeah, I think that should amount to discrimination."
6513,<|emo_disgust|> He wasn’t there for any of it. He is the one in the wrong.
6514,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Fuck the rangers"" is a popular refrain this week."
6515,"<|emo_disgust|> The last book barelyeven touched upon any of these matters, it actually just talked about the gods. And the gods are actually quite bad at supporting the poor."
6517,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] fuck ‘03 ‘05. I hate the rangers
6518,<|emo_disgust|> I hate bet welcher
6519,<|emo_disgust|> Lol hate it man
6520,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch. That looks terrible. I hope it's worse than that.
6521,<|emo_disgust|> Damn [NAME] and [NAME] are bad together
6522,<|emo_disgust|> I just had an experience with a woman that I felt extremely disgusted
6523,"<|emo_disgust|> I think a lot of these posts are actually great for showing the ugly side of things that go on at places like camps and sweats. Sadly, they also provide great screenshotttes."
6524,<|emo_disgust|> You're a bloody horrible human being.
6525,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] what an attention seeker.
6526,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, I want to see a poster for The Amazing Spider Man opposite [NAME] in the same spot as the Amazing Spider Man!"
6527,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fucking monster. As is [NAME]
6529,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird that when a lot of these people were growing up they didn't believe any of this stuff.
6530,<|emo_disgust|> It was a pretty weird response by him.
6531,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking turd.
6532,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, I didn't know this was gonna be a thing, I was just gonna write ""oh this sucks"" to the end, though, haha! "
6533,<|emo_disgust|> i have been to a lot of churches and have seen that churches were often not very friendly and if i went there i spent a good amount of time feeling very unwelcome and unwelcome
6534,<|emo_disgust|> That is just sick. Don't do shit like that ever again.
6535,<|emo_disgust|> This is the only picture in the thread of him wearing a mask. Get him.
6536,<|emo_disgust|> I just want to be alone
6537,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, it'd be weird to have two of the same power-amp-shaped amp with almost no hum."
6538,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I didn’t notice that.
6539,<|emo_disgust|> It's still creepy as hell.
6540,<|emo_disgust|> This team needs to tighten up in the third. Absolutely brutal.
6541,<|emo_disgust|> No they're not. There's no evidence that he didn't commit that crime. His guilt is entirely clear
6542,<|emo_disgust|> I’m sorry my child is one.
6543,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah. So no, they are just wrong."
6545,<|emo_disgust|> If the head of state should decide we can’t run a campaign? FUCKKKK
6547,"<|emo_disgust|> So! The woman who accidentally shot a helpless old man! He had a gun in his hand, why would you shoot him? You can't shoot him!"
6549,"<|emo_disgust|> They were going for that ""she looks like she's had a lot of bad things done to her"" angle."
6550,<|emo_disgust|> What a pathetic response. You are pathetic.
6551,<|emo_disgust|> i feel slightly offended
6552,"<|emo_disgust|> You're a horrible, disgusting person."
6553,<|emo_disgust|> If a grown man is offended by small children then he isn't grown man.
6554,<|emo_disgust|> Lol I do not like to be called that
6557,<|emo_disgust|> We have to have him in the same room as [NAME] to know he isn't a scammer.
6558,<|emo_disgust|> It would show that the [NAME] is a lier than what's being said here
6560,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Stingray"" is as useless in this situation as the original ""Duckduck"" was."
6561,"<|emo_disgust|> He was so awkward, I felt bad for him. You have to be a weirdo to come out like that though."
6562,<|emo_disgust|> She's just like the one from Biggers vs. Browns. Except she loves football and is a public speaker.
6563,<|emo_disgust|> That dude put a bad ex on him for no reason.
6564,"<|emo_disgust|> If she knew the pills were that bad, she would have called the cops... Not a good scene."
6565,<|emo_disgust|> Why does everyone say that? Because they’re afraid to lose shit.
6568,<|emo_disgust|> That looks disgusting
6569,<|emo_disgust|> I don't think we need to worry about the details of the trade just now. It's more important to make it a deal that benefits both parties.
6570,"<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting and offensive. I am a mom, not some weirdo saying those things. "
6571,<|emo_disgust|> I would say it's a bit weird because she is a bit older and is making the effort to look younger.
6573,<|emo_disgust|> People sure are willing to believe anything Donut says to try and make you miserable.
6574,<|emo_disgust|> I'll write ailler for you. The writer is already pissed off so go get your facts confused.
6575,<|emo_disgust|> This is very Dope.
6577,"<|emo_disgust|> We are a peaceful people, just stop."
6578,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I hope you feel better now.
6579,<|emo_disgust|> What are the expected outcomes? How do you know?
6580,<|emo_disgust|> But here's the thing: it would be really really bad for [NAME] if we just kept [NAME] around. That guy's trash.
6581,<|emo_disgust|> And she had a stiletto heel She’s dead
6582,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting. One wonders what would happen if they were flying.
6584,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME], you're getting yourias on here."
6585,<|emo_disgust|> This is my worst fear. I can't imagine a scenario where someone isn't stupid enough to do this.
6586,<|emo_disgust|> That's terrible. I'm sorry for your loss
6587,<|emo_disgust|> That is very creepy. Very odd indeed.
6588,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] what a dog
6589,<|emo_disgust|> Worst thing to happen to a boyfriend
6590,"<|emo_disgust|> No you are a horrible human being, you're a monster "
6592,<|emo_disgust|> I'm thinking [NAME] is talking shit because I don't see him giving it a hard time on the floor.
6594,<|emo_disgust|> I like the carpool part because I hate the hair part.
6595,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, is there any irony in saying women should be libelled and demeaned in order to be equal before the law? "
6596,<|emo_disgust|> I want to be in the room when [NAME] is cheered for coming back
6597,<|emo_disgust|> i feel jealous and hurt all the time
6598,"<|emo_disgust|> If there was a way to get rid of all the trash, there would be none left. And that's disgusting"
6599,<|emo_disgust|> Lol it’s so disgusting
6600,<|emo_disgust|> i don t think she d much of anything to do with the murder at all and the fact that the killer was she feels even more horrible
6601,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck I need a new gun
6602,<|emo_disgust|> It's so disgusting but also so right. Both poles would be right.
6603,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry your buddy is so heartless, but he has no fucking clue how to be a boyfriend to you."
6604,<|emo_disgust|> This person should be outed to aigslist ad.
6605,<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck?
6606,"<|emo_disgust|> Who are they, some kind of pro-Assad group? You don't get to call your own side ""Assad"" just to be outraged by it"
6608,<|emo_disgust|> In your eyes? Shut up.
6609,<|emo_disgust|> The fact [NAME] isn't even a vegan makes it even worse that he's spreading false information.
6610,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, are we doomed?"
6611,<|emo_disgust|> That's just... excuse me what the actually FUCK
6612,<|emo_disgust|> Why? It’s a fucking pizza sent to me by my crush
6613,"<|emo_disgust|> >it wasnt the worst of the games, it was the worst of the conference finals It was, but I like to see it as the worst of the conference finals for a reason"
6614,<|emo_disgust|> I have seen this meme a couple times and thought it was funny. Then I saw the video and couldn’t help myself
6615,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, that's how many people actually clicked the link you just posted?"
6616,"<|emo_disgust|> There are two sides to every story, and no one is callingous or cruel towards the dead because they were defending their religion and culture."
6617,<|emo_disgust|> The main reason anyone's watching is to complain about how awful the show is.
6618,<|emo_disgust|> She's a horrible person and she's a terrible hero.
6619,<|emo_disgust|> i feel disgusted to know a man is ashamed of his penis
6620,"<|emo_disgust|> >How dare this be politics As a libertarian, this seems odd on so many levels. "
6621,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh man, I really didn't think this was coming, but it's actually going to be something big. Please welcome season 2 of tinvisi "
6623,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating. Everytime you get a good reaction or even a laugh it makes me sick.
6624,"<|emo_disgust|> I have no idea what these things are, but I'm glad you told them to their faces before they caused any more harm than good."
6625,"<|emo_disgust|> It’s not because of his body but his brain. You're disgusting, bt"
6626,<|emo_disgust|> That's true of most of [NAME] but not fully.
6629,<|emo_disgust|> She must have a very boring life.
6630,<|emo_disgust|> How sad. She deserves better.
6632,<|emo_disgust|> The third period was much worse. Our power play was on another.500 pace for most of it.
6633,<|emo_disgust|> But it would be terrible if everyone knew what the term meant
6634,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck your life
6635,<|emo_disgust|> I could never quite get behind the idea that a woman should not act entitled to sexual favours because shes a human being.
6636,<|emo_disgust|> No. No youre an awful person.
6638,"<|emo_disgust|> It's racist and sexist and it makes no sense, except that our democracy is only meant to serve the interests of a few."
6639,<|emo_disgust|> He must really hate changing dies because he's able to turn it inside out like a pizza.
6640,<|emo_disgust|> This will always be my worst fear
6641,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] the scum of the internet.
6642,<|emo_disgust|> Now I’m wondering why he’s shirtless when the shirt is down
6643,"<|emo_disgust|> Lol, even worse. What other choices do you have?"
6644,<|emo_disgust|> This is ugly
6645,<|emo_disgust|> This might be a good thing to explore in future playthroughs. For me the enemies just take so much out of my skillset making the fight frustrating and time consuming
6646,<|emo_disgust|> In that case.... Fuck off.
6647,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck I heard the story about the old Italian inn in Cairns and how the customer was a pensioner and didn’t want a Bloody bar crawl
6648,<|emo_disgust|> Weird as hell I think I’d take it any day
6649,<|emo_disgust|> Damn these refs really couldn’t believe it.
6650,<|emo_disgust|> Oh god it's so true
6651,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] you fucking moron.
6652,"<|emo_disgust|> This is one of the worst I've seen. The last picture had the sound on it, full of swear words."
6655,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck off already
6656,<|emo_disgust|> He has no idea how to manage a business...that's the real story
6657,<|emo_disgust|> We're all [RELIGION] if we don't pray to the same god
6658,<|emo_disgust|> I’m on it. And what the heck is that horrible shirt?
6660,<|emo_disgust|> No way you think. People do this all the time. It's gross. It's insane how many people do this. :(
6661,<|emo_disgust|> Weird that a dude who brags about being an drag queen can't pick up women.
6663,<|emo_disgust|> But the rest of you are so freaking awful “oh my god did we really do this?”
6664,<|emo_disgust|> This is a very obvious example of why I hate reddit.
6665,<|emo_disgust|> No youre a worse troll than [NAME]
6666,<|emo_disgust|> > The real heroes aren't the ones who get in a fight with a hungry pig. The real heroes are *the ones* who care about others.
6667,<|emo_disgust|> I am ashamed I have allowed myself to become this way
6668,<|emo_disgust|> A fuck ton of people hated him before this.
6669,<|emo_disgust|> I'm a guy. But this is disgusting.
6670,<|emo_disgust|> I find it disgusting that they think 35 and above are rich.
6671,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] can’t take his eyes off it!
6672,<|emo_disgust|> That's worse tbh
6673,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is what allowed ISIS to become so big, you need to bomb ISIS any chance you get."
6675,<|emo_disgust|> Those things still haunt my dreams to this day.
6676,<|emo_disgust|> This looks like unfunny satire. Get over it
6677,<|emo_disgust|> That seems extremely reckless.
6680,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh there's a catch, but that's just my half hour of video on the subject"
6682,<|emo_disgust|> It'll be over in a few hours with or without me...the internet never disappoints
6683,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh god [NAME] just put the whole world on notice, I hate me tooooo"
6684,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird, sometimes I really feel like a person. I'm glad I can express myself, but sometimes I really want to kill myself. "
6685,<|emo_disgust|> You’re a horrible person for making that choice
6686,<|emo_disgust|> >he looks like a creep to me Also I'm a creep.
6687,<|emo_disgust|> Your mother is stupid.
6688,<|emo_disgust|> You fucking privileged piece of shit!
6689,<|emo_disgust|> This is the one reddit account I don't like because they don't want to go on the show
6691,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking love the shift on the radio last night.
6693,<|emo_disgust|> I don’t know you but hearing your parents swear gives me anxiety.
6695,<|emo_disgust|> It sounds like the right. They hated him because he didn't want to fight them and wanted to go home
6696,<|emo_disgust|> Not at all. We live in a society now where hate speech is punished more severely than it was even a generation ago.
6697,<|emo_disgust|> This one is my worst fear
6698,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] what a bully.
6699,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds frustrating.
6701,<|emo_disgust|> It's a good thing they can't have an abortion now. All those poor defenseless women are surely too traumatized to think of getting one now.
6702,<|emo_disgust|> They should go outside the house...
6703,<|emo_disgust|> That’s awful... I’m so sorry if your situation is awful. I’m not a therapist. But I hope that helps. Be strong.
6704,"<|emo_disgust|> Those are the worst lyrics ever, and theest thing about them is they're actually true"
6705,<|emo_disgust|> Not to mention that [NAME] hated him during their courtship.
6707,"<|emo_disgust|> The world is so fucked up.. I just wanna live, I just wanna be alive, I just wanna be happy, I just wanna make the world a better place through loving kindness and peaceful coexistence"
6708,"<|emo_disgust|> Lol look at you, newbs. /s"
6709,<|emo_disgust|> The fuck? That’s beyond fucking creepy
6710,<|emo_disgust|> There’s the problem with the definition of a hate crime. It is against the public good.
6712,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is looking sick over there
6714,"<|emo_disgust|> We are all in this together. A supportive family, if any, is key."
6715,<|emo_disgust|> No he did and that’s why he’s angry now
6716,<|emo_disgust|> You see a mangy fukuk gorilla you dit dare take a picture with!
6717,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating. I was so happy for [NAME] to turn around and become a PragerU rn but [NAME]???...
6718,<|emo_disgust|> >and now you have someone saying that they've never even been inebriated What a load of old shite.
6719,"<|emo_disgust|> If I ever find out my ex has cheated, I'm going to be so heartbroken."
6721,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, sometimes I wonder if they actually care."
6722,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing standing between you two is internet hate.
6723,<|emo_disgust|> They have a special bond!
6724,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting.... please make more... please make this stop....
6726,<|emo_disgust|> A lot of people do that because it's creepy and weird. Mine is just creepy and weird
6727,<|emo_disgust|> It's not about being smart if the goal is to be a rapist and murderer. It's all about being a stupid and destructive asshole myself.
6728,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] no...
6729,<|emo_disgust|> If her family was sitting directly opposite her then maybe she wouldn't have rushed off for a flight. 
6731,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a nasty old man.
6732,<|emo_disgust|> It's so disgusting how our society today deals with this kind of behavior.
6733,<|emo_disgust|> My dad works for Nasa and apparently he's never heard of this. There's something about the meaning of life that he seems to not understand
6734,<|emo_disgust|> Omg no way he’s bigger than [NAME]!!
6735,<|emo_disgust|> I find the face in the photo quite creepy.
6736,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a monster.
6737,<|emo_disgust|> He fucking texts all the girls he likes. And his friends.
6738,<|emo_disgust|> Who cares.... He is 30
6739,<|emo_disgust|> He was never horrible for this
6740,<|emo_disgust|> I swear that’s one of my worst nightmares actually. It’s way worse than the [NAME] nightmare I had.
6741,<|emo_disgust|> I just think all that disgusting shit from his mouth is pure karma.
6742,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is just crazy.
6743,<|emo_disgust|> There is absolutely nothing virtuous about sexual frustration.
6744,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like my mom wouldnt want me to fight dirty
6745,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]? He was awful in GFW. Not on GFW.
6746,"<|emo_disgust|> I've always found it weird that people talk about themselves as ""the other"" when they are so clearly just trying to distance themselves from the rest of you"
6748,<|emo_disgust|> This sounds like total garbage.
6749,<|emo_disgust|> i feel the cold air a lot
6750,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, it's not just the cost that's the issue, it's the quality as well. I gave it 4 stars because the quality and sound are shaky."
6751,<|emo_disgust|> I've got a bad feeling I'm gonna get something similar in the mail today.
6753,<|emo_disgust|> I do not like him either but I'm going to pick him up anyways. Sounds awful
6754,<|emo_disgust|> The main reason I left is because it's hard to switch between splitscreen and singleplayer.
6757,<|emo_disgust|> The fucking worst channel ever.
6758,<|emo_disgust|> It's a weird thing to be done [NAME].
6759,<|emo_disgust|> Oh my gosh. What did I do wrong?
6762,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that’s a hot pic shame he’s not here
6763,<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest part is that everyone seems to have these conversations in public. Not a good thing.
6764,<|emo_disgust|> My own worst enemy
6765,"<|emo_disgust|> Not only that, it’s incredibly ugly"
6766,"<|emo_disgust|> In your opinion, what is a rape? Can you provide any examples?"
6767,<|emo_disgust|> People being unkind to him...
6768,<|emo_disgust|> He lost both his legs below the age of 20...he got his legs from a horrifically broken ankle...he's lucky to be alive today
6769,<|emo_disgust|> I'm really not shocked. I was more expecting them to do something really crazy. Something that would really test their mettle. Something that would get them fired
6770,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh shit, he's so rich!"
6771,<|emo_disgust|> I was petrified...
6775,<|emo_disgust|> My eyes are hurting from how furiously they're rolling in my sockets right now
6777,<|emo_disgust|> Don't use the N-word.
6778,<|emo_disgust|> Just get off your high horse and apologize for your ignorance and childish sarcasm.
6779,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I don't like to be bothered by the small print"" "
6780,"<|emo_disgust|> And I hate the person who decided to get involved. Theyed, and that was it."
6781,<|emo_disgust|> When my ex and i have sex I usually pick up the pace after a while but I still can't get the rhythm going. He's like 5 stone overweight and takes way longer than me.
6782,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting. Im going to get lane duty odd as hell all week this passes. Im not a driver or a son. You are the worst.
6784,<|emo_disgust|> This is the dumbest thing I've seen today
6785,"<|emo_disgust|> And if they are, he's been extremely bad at backing that claim up."
6786,<|emo_disgust|> That was an awful open shot....
6787,<|emo_disgust|> I was so sad when I found out his ex wife had fathered his son. What a horrible mommy [NAME].
6788,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking dumbass lol
6789,<|emo_disgust|> He's looking at a blank canvas! What could possibly go wrong?
6790,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I wish I could.
6791,<|emo_disgust|> You're right..I should really be doing away with ALL contact with the police and all recognition..but you're right..
6792,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, I don't like that we have a sitting dignitary in the White House."
6793,<|emo_disgust|> That’s one of the worst stories I’ve read on reddit this year
6795,"<|emo_disgust|> You're a racist, sexist, homophobe, you're disgusting. "
6796,"<|emo_disgust|> It wasn't illegal, but now it is. We're a long way off from getting that. It'll have to be eventually, but right now it's a terrible time to do it. "
6797,<|emo_disgust|> It's a popular conspiracy theories start talking about the ghost of [NAME] and his legs running around the place like a bullet train
6798,<|emo_disgust|> This just reminds me to find a way to hate [NAME] on her own terms
6799,<|emo_disgust|> Oh of course!! How dare you question our very existence!! /s
6802,<|emo_disgust|> It is absolutely disgusting. Any country that allows this to happen is a horrible example for the rest.
6807,<|emo_disgust|> My favorite part of this is when they all sing along to the beat at the end with a Weird Al impersonation
6808,<|emo_disgust|> I want SO MUCH TO SHUT MY ASS UP
6809,<|emo_disgust|> We're a bunch of mean people who call each other mean things on the internet.
6810,<|emo_disgust|> This is pretty bad
6812,<|emo_disgust|> Weird how it is that even most of these conservatives are terrified of losing Iowa or New Hampshire.
6813,<|emo_disgust|> That woman looks like nothing I’ve ever seen before! She has so many weird looks from everywhere. Its terrifying.
6814,"<|emo_disgust|> Weirdly, I also use the word weirdly here. "
6815,"<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst I've ever seen, the worst I've ever seen since I've been blogging"
6816,<|emo_disgust|> My biggest pet hate of all time is this
6817,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing worse than [NAME] is an actual vegan lecturing potential customers about how they need to eat animals to be healthful and fit.
6819,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] what an awful player
6820,<|emo_disgust|> It's one of the weirdest hours of the night I think.
6821,"<|emo_disgust|> Not the worst, just the worst because it was live studio audience."
6822,<|emo_disgust|> Thats just fucked up. All you have are bad apples and he did nothing wrong.
6823,<|emo_disgust|> Lol just hate the guy.
6825,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh sure it is. And I'm not surprised at all. I hate what it does and I hate you for saying that. All for the sake of being a [RELIGION] denier. Btw, no links to your other posts. 😂"
6827,<|emo_disgust|> i could have just stopped and looked at her i feel really greedy and disgusting for what i just did
6829,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, your a pro liar if you talk like that about cops."
6831,<|emo_disgust|> You might be right to worry. But what are you afraid of?
6832,<|emo_disgust|> I'm going to say this is bad for the environment. Bad idea lol.
6833,<|emo_disgust|> But it’s still a horror show
6834,<|emo_disgust|> They both crazy
6836,"<|emo_disgust|> It's a fucking noob question. I can't tell you which ones are worse, because I don't know and don't care."
6837,"<|emo_disgust|> It has to be one of those ""if you don't like him, then there's no point of visiting"" situations."
6838,<|emo_disgust|> Your video stops then where the fuck did you shoot them?
6839,<|emo_disgust|> The only good news is that you're probably not his wife. He should probably end it as fast as he started it.
6841,<|emo_disgust|> Well that sucks for you but the fact you're making similar comments shows the depths to which [NAME] has sink to.
6842,"<|emo_disgust|> People make the world a better place because they are dissatisfied, hateful, or otherwise unathletic."
6843,<|emo_disgust|> How dare she not understand that [NAME] is her superior officer!
6844,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I don't like it, we should do away with it!"" usually followed by ""I don't mind, perhaps you don't."" "
6845,<|emo_disgust|> A fuckton more effort needed to turn that picture into a meme that's anything other than disgusting.
6847,<|emo_disgust|> That’s not even a damn dinger....
6848,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is horrible on the floor, but he can't guard bigs."
6851,<|emo_disgust|> I wish that had never happened to me. Thank god for that.
6852,<|emo_disgust|> I wish I could be alone but I’m scared to send my text to [NAME]..
6853,<|emo_disgust|> But it's too damn early for that lol...
6854,<|emo_disgust|> Damn it. I would of just listened to it if they said the ending was *even worse* than the beginning lol. Lol
6856,"<|emo_disgust|> You have such bad taste, and taste is something to be judged based on its content, not on its flavour..."
6857,<|emo_disgust|> i get the feeling that everyone is annoyed at me
6858,<|emo_disgust|> This is a disgusting thread.
6859,<|emo_disgust|> You need to find someone who loves you but doesn’t resent how you can’t love someone
6861,<|emo_disgust|> I swear if this is real I'm going to be very disturbed until about the second they land
6863,"<|emo_disgust|> That's just stupid, what the actual fuck."
6867,<|emo_disgust|> This whole sub makes me want to die
6868,<|emo_disgust|> My boyfriend's birthday on our anniversary weekend is a fucking monster!
6869,<|emo_disgust|> i dont really have any stories about that so im writing about that instead and feeling very grouchy
6870,<|emo_disgust|> That's a lot of karma.
6871,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is when state laws are changed because of politics rather than being made to actually work.
6873,<|emo_disgust|> The world keeps getting smaller. It's been going this way since record keeping began. It's just the nature of living to make the planet bigger. /s
6874,<|emo_disgust|> It looks like a fake ID and is likely a scam. strongly discouraged.
6875,"<|emo_disgust|> Ouch, that was brutal. "
6877,"<|emo_disgust|> I think if anything it was more proof that [NAME] is a racist, sexist, homophobe."
6878,<|emo_disgust|> No. It's rude and offensive and I'm not proud of you. But you're an edit warrior now and you know what? You better do your best. 
6879,<|emo_disgust|> How can you hate [NAME]? He helped shape [NAME] character right in his hands. This is disgusting.
6880,<|emo_disgust|> Your ass after I beat you so hard that you shit yourself in your pants like a fucking dog
6881,"<|emo_disgust|> You're a disgusting, insane, psychopath."
6882,<|emo_disgust|> This is what makes it so awful. They're barely even dressing the same.
6883,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, your family must be wealthy."
6884,<|emo_disgust|> I just don’t like those people.
6885,<|emo_disgust|> I don't give a fuck about the Super Bowl. Fuck the super bowl.
6886,<|emo_disgust|> I'm really not sure how I feel about this tbh. It seems crazy to me that we've given up 2nd and 3rd down so much in the red zone this year. It's weird.
6887,<|emo_disgust|> This joke is disgusting and offensive to anyone with a brain.
6888,"<|emo_disgust|> He's also said similar things about how hard he feels about the word ""cuckolding"""
6889,<|emo_disgust|> I'd rather just be hated than to be hated by [NAME] personally :(
6891,<|emo_disgust|> I hate this so much.
6892,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] can’t play. You’re so mad dawg
6893,<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry. I hate it too. I hope you find something better to do.
6894,<|emo_disgust|> The lack of any boundaries of some pedophile makes me worry for society more than the laws against it.
6895,<|emo_disgust|> What a strange thing to say.
6896,<|emo_disgust|> It’s not like she’s a horrible person to start with... she just needs to be punished as hard as possible for the things she has committed
6898,"<|emo_disgust|> It's a funny game, kinda like poke ball but with giant balls with no legs"
6899,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm too busy hating them in real life to even bother watching this sub, let alone commenting. The anger, general revulsion I feel for these people is so strong that I've given up caring. "
6900,<|emo_disgust|> People are animals!!!!
6901,<|emo_disgust|> Because it's a mass media lie.
6902,<|emo_disgust|> I was gonna say he was a porn addict then I remembered that this is a sub for dealing drugs so yeah. I was gonna say he was a junkie then I thought of it
6903,<|emo_disgust|> It’s so creepy you’re right.
6904,<|emo_disgust|> It is disgusting that the top level sub on r/recoveryoriented only contains articles on how to fuck up your heart.
6905,"<|emo_disgust|> My god, he lost the ball."
6906,<|emo_disgust|> That’s sick!
6907,<|emo_disgust|> It’s kinda sick how many people don’t know this. I’m with you and it would be so much worse if it was my dad.
6908,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I don't even know which team he is rooting for!!
6910,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking idiot lol. Fucking think that shit wont land him in fucking trouble.
6911,<|emo_disgust|> What a stupid thing to say.
6912,<|emo_disgust|> The third picture gives me bad flashbacks to my cat.
6913,<|emo_disgust|> I’d bet the majority of [NAME] are still single.
6914,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating. You have to love your parents. #SJs
6915,<|emo_disgust|> We have a president who says some pretty weird things.
6916,"<|emo_disgust|> And he's a failed politician, period."
6917,<|emo_disgust|> The last two books had me completelyomach sink. I wanted to throw my hands up in the air and say I was beyond fucking terrified!
6918,<|emo_disgust|> That's so creepy.
6919,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was horrible but i was watching the game from the bleachers and didnt really notice that
6920,<|emo_disgust|> This is so pathetic and makes me sick.
6921,<|emo_disgust|> But it IS horrifyingally expensive.
6922,<|emo_disgust|> I never even knew there were so many! I love being in Lhasa.
6924,<|emo_disgust|> In the fucking comments I've seen they don’t even go there
6925,<|emo_disgust|> Damn straight it is
6926,<|emo_disgust|> That was an awful open shot.... [NAME] missed so many 3s here.
6927,<|emo_disgust|> We’re so rich!
6928,<|emo_disgust|> My daughter told me not to hug her after she told me she could kiss me any time. I feel bad now🙏
6930,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has put his heart and soul into something so stupid you would think he walked into it with a knife or something
6931,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh whoops, it's yikes."
6932,<|emo_disgust|> A week ago I said he was too low to get into the argument. He's still too low.
6933,<|emo_disgust|> But it looks fake anyway.
6934,<|emo_disgust|> That's horrible. People doing terrible things in the name of religion is wrong.
6935,<|emo_disgust|> This sounds more appropriate for a horror subreddit. /r/twghouls
6936,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] what a ballsista.
6938,<|emo_disgust|> It’s really hard to take them seriously sometimes tbh
6939,<|emo_disgust|> This really made me angry. Imagine thinking this.
6940,<|emo_disgust|> This is my favorite one ever.
6942,<|emo_disgust|> i feel wronged in my ways
6943,<|emo_disgust|> Why? Why are the bastards ruining Ontario and Canada?
6944,<|emo_disgust|> Because if you think that we have a choice no matter what then you are totally ignorant.
6945,<|emo_disgust|> I don’t know the actual quote but I’m fucking starving now after reading that.
6946,<|emo_disgust|> But it looked way worse than what it is now...
6948,<|emo_disgust|> So disgusting.
6951,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so offended that i cant even take anymore
6952,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn I didn’t realise we got a 2nd half this bad. Thanks for the leads, it’s always been like this."
6954,<|emo_disgust|> I'm too cheap to go to the gym and I hate having to go to the bathroom.
6955,<|emo_disgust|> Thats even worse tbh I dont think i'll be getting a new car in another 6 months
6958,<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell wears swim trunks to a competition
6959,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has been one of the ugliest characters in recent times. [NAME] still sucks though.
6960,<|emo_disgust|> Why do you assume my worth...
6961,<|emo_disgust|> My mom had it custom made as a Christmas gift for my sister who is in college. She ended up breaking it into little pieces and gifting the pieces to friends.
6963,<|emo_disgust|> That’s so disgusting. OK
6964,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was awful, I hated watching him."
6965,"<|emo_disgust|> > But they're not a faith withstood the test of time. Have to say, [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME] will all be gone in a while too."
6966,<|emo_disgust|> I really miss AG
6967,<|emo_disgust|> My wife has it coming. 😖
6968,<|emo_disgust|> I knew this was bullshit when that intro cut out.
6969,"<|emo_disgust|> How is such a bad thing? I would go ahead and say, as a fellow-avocado, I hate it."
6970,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds horrible. I'm very sorry for your loss.
6971,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, and now vini is down. Btw, it was a bullshit call"
6972,"<|emo_disgust|> That was so infuriating. We need to do better, next time something like that happens, we better be prepared"
6973,<|emo_disgust|> Oh there's even worse.
6974,"<|emo_disgust|> The real worst one is when people call them ""second skin"", when it's literally skin deep."
6975,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so fucked up all the time
6976,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch. I thought he was a pretty clever and subtle impersonation.
6979,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, you're not. The problem is that [NAME] wants to make some money so that his daughter can go out and fuck all the nice kids she goes out with."
6981,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has a fucking gun oh my god.
6982,<|emo_disgust|> They are just making themselves look ridiculous.
6983,<|emo_disgust|> Lol what a weird way to spell Disenchanted
6986,<|emo_disgust|> That was a foul on [NAME]
6988,"<|emo_disgust|> This is a tad too loud for my comfort level though, I don't think I'll ever want to live in the Cantabuz Zone."
6990,<|emo_disgust|> Your a fucking idiot.
6991,<|emo_disgust|> She took that picture of myself? For shame.
6992,<|emo_disgust|> Because it's more socially acceptable to have a gun fight with your neighbors than to get yourself into one.
6993,<|emo_disgust|> He does say that sometimes his emotions get the better of him though. He will listen!
6994,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like it was rushed through and then this happens and i feel disgusted
6995,<|emo_disgust|> Not just a random picture - this is the top comment 
6996,<|emo_disgust|> This is a really terrible idea
6997,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing that changed was the price. That's still ridiculously high
7001,"<|emo_disgust|> He had been tortured by the Congolese government for years now, and many believe he is indeed still a hideous, evil man. "
7002,<|emo_disgust|> Weird. Maybe too weird. Maybe just weird.
7003,<|emo_disgust|> That’s what I was thinking too! Now I’m just mad because I’m only 20
7004,<|emo_disgust|> I wish they'd get some fat guys to play with. Would be nice to play with [NAME]
7005,<|emo_disgust|> It's just so stupid. We keep getting worse and worse.
7006,<|emo_disgust|> Just go home already.
7007,"<|emo_disgust|> Worst advice ever. This comment is karma stealing, plain and simple. Edit: I've taken it less seriously now."
7008,<|emo_disgust|> What an awful list
7009,<|emo_disgust|> I'm surprised it's still a thing. At least for now.
7010,<|emo_disgust|> Your entire post is an attack on men who have no sense of self-worth.
7011,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a sad, talented, and good football player. He should be kept."
7012,"<|emo_disgust|> Fuck you, I’m a 25 year old. I’m still in my 20s and getting shit. "
7013,<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest thing is that she's single
7015,<|emo_disgust|> It’s the most disgusting article of shit that’s happened to me in a while. Please get [NAME] banned from /r/tworeddit
7016,<|emo_disgust|> You don't need to be an asshole to call people whiny.
7017,<|emo_disgust|> And that wig is awful.
7020,<|emo_disgust|> She should have stayed at home and called the police
7023,<|emo_disgust|> What a dumbass
7026,<|emo_disgust|> The fuck? How are they making their kid starve for that much time to waste being a dumbass?
7027,<|emo_disgust|> He must smell terrible when he sweats.
7028,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, I thought I was the only person who hated this."
7030,<|emo_disgust|> I'm saying he's a moron.
7031,<|emo_disgust|> There's nothing more ridiculous than saying these things without being the asshole you're assholishly pointing fingers at someone around you.
7032,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I’m leaving the industry.
7034,"<|emo_disgust|> He just said this about himself recently, wow I was surprised to see his name pop up out of thin air. "
7036,"<|emo_disgust|> I mean, if it's that bad you're probably a very naughty child. "
7038,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking idiotic way to ask for a forgiveness and ask him what's wrong with you (and other dudes) who were on the receiving end of similar things. Fuck off with requests like this.
7039,<|emo_disgust|> Just make sure the cops find it before the stockade is up.
7040,<|emo_disgust|> What a terrible list.
7041,<|emo_disgust|> Because men are by far the worst.
7042,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] looks horrible for this one- he looks like he just came out of a horror movie.
7043,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn, she's probably cheating on you too."
7044,<|emo_disgust|> The irony of it all. The rich are getting fucked (by far).
7045,<|emo_disgust|> They don't have a lot of women on their staff. A lot of them are lawyers. I'm a horrible lawyer and I've never heard of someone being an N1 before.
7046,<|emo_disgust|> The whole purpose of taking a test is to find out if you're intelligent enough to get an interview. No one should waste their time taking stupid tests.
7048,<|emo_disgust|> That's horrible. The only good thing to come out of that would be worse if the baby was retarded
7050,"<|emo_disgust|> Just a kid, 6. That's how old his parents are..."
7051,"<|emo_disgust|> He should go back on his word and get some help, that kid is history. He needs to realize he can't take his foot off the gas pedal."
7052,<|emo_disgust|> i feel is hateful to my family who are still fighting their battle against cancer and i know the struggle is far from over
7053,"<|emo_disgust|> But [NAME] has been talking shit about [NAME] for a while now, talk about a shit though."
7054,<|emo_disgust|> She's not a virgin she's a pro-ABBYY. Take your fucking upvote
7055,<|emo_disgust|> Thats a hot pic Shame he didnt pick you up and drop you off at your friend's house.
7056,<|emo_disgust|> How is it racist? It just isn't.
7058,<|emo_disgust|> Holy moly I've felt worse
7059,<|emo_disgust|> How the hell does this fucken grammar Dislike Dislike before a word? Like *JUDGE* I can't imagine they used Dislike
7060,<|emo_disgust|> This is literally one of the worst I've seen.
7061,"<|emo_disgust|> Well done. Tried doing it in my city before, it's awful."
7062,<|emo_disgust|> Your friend should get pissed off.
7063,<|emo_disgust|> They can only do so much until they find out about [NAME] secret relationship
7064,<|emo_disgust|> Lol you're so stupid.
7065,<|emo_disgust|> We are talking about a dude that has a history of saying awful things about pedophiles. Who knows if he is truly a pedophile?
7066,"<|emo_disgust|> This looks like the future, complete nastiness"
7068,<|emo_disgust|> It's a shame that some parents would shame and shame children for the simple act of using a public transportation system that's been open for 70 years.
7069,<|emo_disgust|> She’s probably cheating on you guys. :(
7071,<|emo_disgust|> Weird how they all act like they dont get that. Maybe they do.
7073,"<|emo_disgust|> No, we're talking about the original 3DS. Which was a terrible game, but what is new"
7075,"<|emo_disgust|> How dare they. Just because you believe in free will, doesn't mean you'd do anything to harm it then."
7076,<|emo_disgust|> And you're ugly
7077,<|emo_disgust|> The saddest thing about this is that [NAME] doesn't seem bad at all
7079,"<|emo_disgust|> No shit, don't you see? She still hasn't done the makeup. So her makeup isnt horrible."
7080,"<|emo_disgust|> The worst part is, he does realize he did something wrong, and he's trying to pretend like nothing ever went his way."
7081,<|emo_disgust|> How fucking dare you comment on /r/Drama?! /s
7082,<|emo_disgust|> Wow i never expected to be so angry at my wife
7085,"<|emo_disgust|> Not your fault, [NAME]."
7087,<|emo_disgust|> i never use their word salad and that is what i hated but it just makes me feel hated in my heart
7088,<|emo_disgust|> This person should be removed from her posts for hate and trolling.
7089,<|emo_disgust|> Oh sorry! I do that. I like to be corrected.
7091,<|emo_disgust|> Your worst Nightmare
7092,<|emo_disgust|> i feel greedy over it all
7093,<|emo_disgust|> This made me SHOOOOM. YED!!!!!!
7094,<|emo_disgust|> She's a mean person.
7095,<|emo_disgust|> And the biggest Nightmare
7097,<|emo_disgust|> My brother is a janitor and I hate how much I love janitors!
7098,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst advice I've ever been told.
7099,"<|emo_disgust|> Not to be mean, but his outfits are awful."
7100,<|emo_disgust|> Well it was a horrible call.
7102,<|emo_disgust|> There's a difference between being childish and being offensive. She was childish because she said stupid stuff.
7104,<|emo_disgust|> That’s a really creepy way of spelling Disenchanted
7105,<|emo_disgust|> I like this.
7106,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah if you're an actual artist you can't complain about how shitty a job a record company is.
7108,<|emo_disgust|> Worst kept secret in the nfl? In 30 years all the Hall of famers have either said or done something terrible
7110,<|emo_disgust|> My goodness!
7111,<|emo_disgust|> The fucking reaper
7112,<|emo_disgust|> You sound angry
7113,<|emo_disgust|> i find myself feeling a little bit grumpy all the time
7115,"<|emo_disgust|> I mean yeah, it kinda sucks because at least there's always [NAME] at the top."
7116,"<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. But as terrible as that one incident was, he wasn't even arrested."
7117,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is trash on both sides of the energy spectrum.... I'm surprised he hasn't been made GM
7119,<|emo_disgust|> Who is that angry grouchy old man?
7120,"<|emo_disgust|> So, she's a ""fiancé?"""
7121,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that they're flying their drone in the rain gives us anxiety.
7122,"<|emo_disgust|> This is me all the time, but the more I think about it the more it makes me a monster."
7123,<|emo_disgust|> No it is not! It's a really good thing that they are using it instead of using some better stuff like polygon shaders and antialiasing which they seem to hate
7124,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird, huh, that Reddit hates porn so much. "
7126,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, [NAME] was awful last year. Maybe he can bounce back in 2017-18. "
7127,<|emo_disgust|> Ove no clue what you're talking about.
7128,<|emo_disgust|> That’s terrible. And what the actual fuck? That is probably the worst thing he’s said about anything.
7130,<|emo_disgust|> >the guy was a lunatic who had a mental health disorder I am not shocked.
7131,<|emo_disgust|> She's probably cheating on you.
7132,<|emo_disgust|> Those women are some of the worst people that I have ever encountered.
7133,<|emo_disgust|> You just don't see it at all. He's a weirdo and is so uncomfortable around other people.
7134,<|emo_disgust|> i feel very cold
7136,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I know a couple of people who don't playby themselves"" Wow talk about being stupid."
7137,<|emo_disgust|> You can't have relationships without being in a committed relationship with someone.
7138,<|emo_disgust|> Oh for sure. I’ve seen all the episodes with [NAME] as [NAME] with [NAME] and [NAME] and it didn’t work.
7139,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a horrible, terrible defender. Yes, yes, yes!"
7140,"<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst thing I've seen so far in 2019. Truly, truly, truly horrifying."
7142,"<|emo_disgust|> Just get on a good flight, it'll take about an hour to get to New York."
7143,<|emo_disgust|> How dare they mention [NAME] is still alive?! (hug)
7144,"<|emo_disgust|> You will be missed, sweetie. Stay strong"
7145,<|emo_disgust|> Because everyone hates freedom
7146,"<|emo_disgust|> I’m actually so sad. She’s supposed to be a model, nothing weird about being ugly or Having Poorlyformed Aspergers. "
7147,<|emo_disgust|> This looks like the worst one I've ever seen.
7148,<|emo_disgust|> If the [NAME] and [NAME] got married it would leave [NAME] and [NAME] with a lot of debt?
7149,"<|emo_disgust|> There is also that ""hacker"" meme"
7150,<|emo_disgust|> You have a weird attitude
7152,"<|emo_disgust|> It is not surprising that this form of birth control would become a problem, as they were discovered to have used banned methods in the past."
7153,<|emo_disgust|> No one loves him and there’s no way he should be allowed to become president.
7154,<|emo_disgust|> It’s honestly just a scam
7155,<|emo_disgust|> This is so disgusting. No one should put more effort into something that could make someone's skin crawl.
7156,<|emo_disgust|> He could have given away the fucking jerseys
7157,<|emo_disgust|> I was a little offended that a vegan place called cruelty Free had location here. Wasn't looking forward to eating at something run-of-the mill like that
7158,<|emo_disgust|> i cant help but feel jealous
7159,<|emo_disgust|> Damn look at that body
7160,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird how fast some people become internet memeppers.
7161,<|emo_disgust|> Damn... Looks like it.
7162,<|emo_disgust|> They’re a bunch of unattractive hoes at a whorehouse.
7163,"<|emo_disgust|> A lot of us aren't into pranks and taunts, we just go for the meathead approach. I'm into the scares and weird scares sometimes."
7164,<|emo_disgust|> I hate [NAME] but this is the best
7165,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, that was fucking disgusting"
7166,"<|emo_disgust|> What?! We have evidence he knew ahead of time what the goals would look like, he knew he would get caught! How..."
7167,<|emo_disgust|> Ohhhhh boy.
7168,<|emo_disgust|> It's a little girls fault for getting into fights in school
7169,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has no idea. He’s the dumbass who is scared of getting Borted.
7170,<|emo_disgust|> Shut up [NAME] you recieving a death threat and you dare claim he's doing aservice to society by using his porn?
7171,"<|emo_disgust|> If you can't stand up to someone because you feel wronged simply because your perspective is different, you're a sad sack of shit. "
7172,<|emo_disgust|> I will never again wear swim trunks to a competition
7173,<|emo_disgust|> No. I don't see any of you guys taking the�donald? I'm literally at the door
7174,"<|emo_disgust|> I have seen their problems, its not the environment. Its the sex. They just want people to give them the attention and sex they want."
7175,<|emo_disgust|> I just want to make friends.
7176,"<|emo_disgust|> The fuck? Just like everyone is wrong about everything in reality, there is also plenty of ""right"" in this post."
7177,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] that makes me so angry!
7178,<|emo_disgust|> > This is why I can't stand video games... Because they make me feel like a goddamn slob.
7179,<|emo_disgust|> >[NAME] is an unrepentant and racist. I hate him so much.
7180,<|emo_disgust|> That's worse. She had the right to not want kids... She's selfish for not wanting them.
7181,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, you might have a point. That looks rather bad tbh."
7182,<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest part about this is how similar most of these are to the [NAME] stories. I've yet to meet a [NAME] story that isn't pretty near perfect.
7183,<|emo_disgust|> What a fuck up.
7186,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I feel awful for your friend. I hope she can move past it.
7188,<|emo_disgust|> I mean it’s the 3rd period so fuck all the goals
7189,"<|emo_disgust|> What the crap?! And not even the ""crap"" was from [NAME]!"
7190,"<|emo_disgust|> It's called a turd trap because it's usually found by dumpsters, but no one ever call it that haha."
7191,<|emo_disgust|> It's not a surprise to me that [NAME] is racist.
7193,<|emo_disgust|> I hate that [NAME] guy so much
7194,<|emo_disgust|> I hate to tell these people but Amazon doesn't fulfill their orders. Fuck off.
7195,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit. This is fucked up. I'm so sorry for your loss. Stay strong and strong as a person.
7196,<|emo_disgust|> i cant help but feel jealous of her
7197,<|emo_disgust|> He looks like one of my exs.. but much better!
7199,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] these refs actually fucking hate us.
7200,<|emo_disgust|> That's a horrible list
7201,<|emo_disgust|> I don’t even care if the players take a pay cut to stay or not. This has been a weird offseason. 
7202,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst I've ever seen. I couldn't even watch the video.
7203,<|emo_disgust|> I want the head of every despot and emissary from every tyrant on earth to poke their pinky up my ass while I'm distracted
7205,<|emo_disgust|> What a load of old shite - this is worse than the [NAME] story
7206,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst I've ever seen. The only thing worse is an ad that's worse still.
7207,<|emo_disgust|> She is a disgusting anti American bigot.
7208,<|emo_disgust|> What is she going to do now that [NAME] is not getting traded? Just keep him around to add some depth.
7209,<|emo_disgust|> I’d go with the latter scenario. Sounds horrible though
7210,<|emo_disgust|> i would not give up the fight if i was feeling completely and utterly hating life
7211,"<|emo_disgust|> But, [NAME] is worse"
7212,"<|emo_disgust|> He looked like the meanest, most mean-spirited, and most hateful man that can possibly exist."
7213,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] what are you talking about?
7216,<|emo_disgust|> We're here for the same thing :'(
7218,<|emo_disgust|> He must hate you. Try living with him a little. Take some pictures and write down who he is.
7219,<|emo_disgust|> That’s horrible. What a nightmare. One of her doctors saw waste paper on his patient’s face last week he should be ashamed.
7220,<|emo_disgust|> So very sad. People like this make me want to die.
7221,<|emo_disgust|> You know what I wanted to say? Fuck you.
7222,"<|emo_disgust|> This is so repulsive, I literally cringed and clutched my ears."
7224,<|emo_disgust|> Not bad at all.
7225,<|emo_disgust|> I don't understand how anyone could possibly hate a dress made of polyester thread
7226,<|emo_disgust|> A guy named [NAME] let his girlfriend have sex with him after she told him what happened. She was drunk.
7228,<|emo_disgust|> That’s an awful lot of bp
7229,<|emo_disgust|> Weird you ask
7231,<|emo_disgust|> My poor space bar is useless now
7232,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] weeps for all the people who think he fucking sucks
7235,<|emo_disgust|> This guy is a moron.
7236,<|emo_disgust|> If he shows disrespect he must be fired.
7238,<|emo_disgust|> That’s awful. I’ve tried before and I still had these. :( I can’t imagine why that is.
7241,<|emo_disgust|> The fuck? I thought it was a joke...
7242,<|emo_disgust|> A-fucking-men! But still he- [NAME] damn I- I like him.
7243,<|emo_disgust|> Damn people are downvoting you for being out of line. You're a moron.
7244,<|emo_disgust|> They are disgusting people in every way.
7245,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking idiotic thing to say. Fuck off
7246,<|emo_disgust|> I would love to hear your evidence for these claims.
7247,<|emo_disgust|> It always makes me feel really creepy when people in power talk about how much they are considering ways to cut programs or close them.
7248,<|emo_disgust|> And they still have shitty air conditioners. You can feel the century old problem.
7249,"<|emo_disgust|> They say history repeating itself, but that's just me..."
7250,<|emo_disgust|> We're so gross
7251,"<|emo_disgust|> I don’t have the exact same issues but I’ve had issues with panic attacks as well. I can’t even sleep at all, it makes everything horrifying"
7252,<|emo_disgust|> We’re not going to hate [NAME] because of this.
7253,<|emo_disgust|> Wow. Yes
7254,"<|emo_disgust|> That dude was beyond cringe worthy, it was creepy"
7255,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I know that's the joke but....
7256,"<|emo_disgust|> And just to add insult to injury, that judge ordered the ex to pay her back. Wow!"
7257,<|emo_disgust|> Just think of the children. Mom of a little Dachshund is appalled to find this on her Facebook wall.
7259,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so dissatisfied with myself and it s because i got into this
7260,<|emo_disgust|> The real bad news is they're letting him go for his performance. He was horrendous on Sunday. Sad.
7261,<|emo_disgust|> I’m not ugly. I have a BPD trait I can get behind.
7262,<|emo_disgust|> The last song was awful honestly
7263,<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest thing about [NAME] actually being in charge at the company is how little he actually matters to them.
7264,<|emo_disgust|> > We're the worst team in the league by far. No you're the worst team in the league.
7265,<|emo_disgust|> >he said the men were drunk. I don't see that as inconsistent at all. Lmfao
7267,<|emo_disgust|> Holy fucking shit I miss that
7269,<|emo_disgust|> I feel like I've been drinking a lot of punch. Damn is there a better word for that!
7270,<|emo_disgust|> And I though Glory Kills were gruesome
7271,<|emo_disgust|> When the only thing keeping your house from being destroyed is a madman with a gun
7272,"<|emo_disgust|> Fucking hate that [NAME] guy, we need a hero like him now."
7273,<|emo_disgust|> You're a disgusting piece of filth.
7274,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] in a gym class. Get him out and give him a real gym class instead
7277,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, that was dirty."
7278,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm with you, pulju has been looking dangerous lately with his new found strength"
7279,<|emo_disgust|> They hate him! Why do they hate him?
7280,<|emo_disgust|> This man is the scum of r/incel.
7281,<|emo_disgust|> That woman had a really hard time breathing and seemed quite emotional
7282,"<|emo_disgust|> It's not hard at all to come up with these fake memes, no matter what kind of search engine you use "
7283,<|emo_disgust|> I am a nasty mouthful to say but you have my attention
7284,<|emo_disgust|> Shut Shut Shut
7287,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking hate that movie
7288,<|emo_disgust|> The guy is so handsome he could grace the cover ofpies
7289,"<|emo_disgust|> Holy crap that's bad I've never seen that before thanks, looks like they were doing a re-pour."
7290,<|emo_disgust|> That would’ve been hard to stomach
7292,<|emo_disgust|> I have zero sympathy for her. Get treatment for your post-traumatic stress disorder. May the gods of [NAME] shine over you.
7293,<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry that was such a hate sub. You're the face of [NAME] in that sub.
7294,"<|emo_disgust|> I know you’re talking about a different subject, but still, I think about this a lot. What a nightmare. "
7296,"<|emo_disgust|> This is just another day, we as humans have the ability and desire to have romantic relationships but we still feel rejected by women. "
7297,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a horrible friend, and he never treated me well in any way."
7298,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't understand how the ""man gets attention by doing something mean to a person"". Is that the only issue, or are you just being a mean person to others just so you can have attention?"
7299,"<|emo_disgust|> This is so disgusting, and I'm shaking in my boots."
7300,<|emo_disgust|> But it’s so awful. I hate it.
7301,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I miss mass Rez her new ult is fucking awful
7302,"<|emo_disgust|> It's not pretty at all, but that man definitely isn't ignorant."
7303,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was such a scary presence on our court, it might not be the most attractive thing to look at "
7304,<|emo_disgust|> You can't make a good meal out of garbage. Unless you have a garbage can full of shit.
7307,<|emo_disgust|> There are also racists and sexists. And that's just the ones in my family. Sad really.
7308,<|emo_disgust|> That's odd. I've also noticed his text messages tend to have weird grammatical issues as well.
7309,"<|emo_disgust|> If [NAME] was a celebrity or a politician, she would have had to answer ""no"" at least twice. Not the everyday sex workers though"
7310,"<|emo_disgust|> That’s disgusting. Not only is it disgusting, it’s positively verboten."
7311,<|emo_disgust|> They're all equally awful though
7312,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah the story fits here. A guy leaves his job while dissatisfied with his situation and finds himself back with it two weeks later!
7313,<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting. No wonder they call bullshit everything they say.
7314,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like i want to make you think im being ridiculous and that doesnt really make me feel better
7315,"<|emo_disgust|> And worst of all, the woman gave birth to a beautiful and healthy boy!"
7317,<|emo_disgust|> That's pretty lewd. Fingers crossed it ends in a way that suits the family best.
7318,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that’s dirty
7319,<|emo_disgust|> Well damn wouldn't want you to fuck up your dog.
7320,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], this sub is the worst."
7323,<|emo_disgust|> He’s a racist.
7324,<|emo_disgust|> You can get a job at by looking for it. If it's low paying it's probably not worth the effort.
7325,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Where's your boyfriend?"" ""I don't want him around here"""
7328,<|emo_disgust|> Not really. You are the stupid one.
7329,<|emo_disgust|> I hate that I like it
7330,"<|emo_disgust|> Just put it away, you dirty smelly bastard!"
7331,<|emo_disgust|> Damn it [NAME]!
7332,"<|emo_disgust|> This just feels like it's another instagram meme. In reality, it's a bad meme"
7333,<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell thought he was dead...ridiculous
7334,"<|emo_disgust|> I swear, this is the cutest thing I've seen on here in a while"
7335,<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting. No one should act like that to you. You're not important who cares.
7336,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has some fucking sense of self-righteousness and anger. What a fucking douche.
7338,"<|emo_disgust|> This is a good thing to know, and so is that [NAME] guy. He fucked up big time..."
7340,<|emo_disgust|> She has to do her homework though... :(
7341,<|emo_disgust|> The only worse thing about this is that the person who posted this comment probably wasn't even [NAME]..
7342,<|emo_disgust|> I want to get my ass kicked for saying that!
7343,<|emo_disgust|> Who in general is against [NAME] but is [NAME] not?
7345,<|emo_disgust|> This was the only acceptable response to this guy's comments about our video. Now we’re seeing angry mobs trying to downvote us instead of understanding the bigger issue here.
7346,<|emo_disgust|> Lol I like you. Have a good day.
7347,"<|emo_disgust|> No, the problem is that your opinion is completely and utterly worthless. "
7348,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] I can’t believe they’re blaming [NAME] for not being a tree.
7349,<|emo_disgust|> That can get very ugly really fast.
7350,"<|emo_disgust|> The only one who could care about the environment is the 1% that own it, the rich will see this and come together to save it"
7351,"<|emo_disgust|> This is terrible... This won’t make him great, but it will make him worse."
7352,<|emo_disgust|> Now there’s a reason I hate Twitter
7353,"<|emo_disgust|> They're saying about 1 in 4 marrieds are still single. I see, 40% of all marrieds are still single."
7355,<|emo_disgust|> Your worst enemy
7356,<|emo_disgust|> Man fucking stop.
7357,<|emo_disgust|> i feel disgusted that these kind of people can be found on this planet but dont think that anyone is wrong to understand that there is a great deal of evil
7358,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a horrible defender
7359,<|emo_disgust|> Why was he wearing a sweatshirt to a competition if he was on a college campus? Just disgusting.
7361,"<|emo_disgust|> They just dont want to pay their workers enough, which is why they have laws like the right of refusal."
7362,<|emo_disgust|> In the worst possible format.
7364,"<|emo_disgust|> And yet, we still refuse to recognize same sex couples. It's disgusting."
7366,<|emo_disgust|> What a complete naught.
7367,<|emo_disgust|> This guy got an assist on a goal and was on the ice all game! #scum
7368,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like im just so incredibly selfish and self centered and I hate it
7369,"<|emo_disgust|> He was a disgusting, insecure, moody, drunk, asshole, and just generally trashy character. "
7371,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, what a load of old shite."
7372,<|emo_disgust|> How the hell are they getting paid to hate [NAME]. Like [NAME] in Crimson Skies or [NAME] in Crimson Skies 2.0?
7373,<|emo_disgust|> He's just jealous they have all these different video game companies and all these different award shows. Look at them!
7374,<|emo_disgust|> That was a vicious 1on1 against [NAME]. What a monster. Look at what he did to [NAME].
7375,<|emo_disgust|> It can never be right. Never...
7376,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, as much as I like it, I don't thinkwe need another [NAME] situation like the one we had. "
7377,<|emo_disgust|> What a rude andincomprehensible statement from you.
7379,<|emo_disgust|> That’s so disgusting
7380,<|emo_disgust|> They are so freaking greedy.
7381,<|emo_disgust|> A guy named [NAME].
7382,<|emo_disgust|> The guy driving the truck was probably drunk and shouldn’t have run a red light there.
7383,<|emo_disgust|> It's not a law. It's a social custom. Your parents just aren’t understanding that...
7384,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], this is so incredibly telling about your mental health. What a toxic culture you live in."
7385,<|emo_disgust|> We've all heard it from experts who had the foresight to put their hands on a hot stove handle to save their lives. This is just bad man...
7386,<|emo_disgust|> I know but it's still extremely creepy
7388,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I’d be fucking pissed if I had to do that.
7389,<|emo_disgust|> But we do believe in the lord and the lord alone.
7390,<|emo_disgust|> i feel really stupid that i dont know why
7391,<|emo_disgust|> Why is it weird that we could build a goddamn fort in Arkansas? Fuck
7392,<|emo_disgust|> The [NAME] of horror!!!
7393,<|emo_disgust|> No more. This is a terrible idea.
7394,"<|emo_disgust|> You're the Worstadiator in the history of the universe, ever. "
7396,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a pro-Assad piece of shit - what a shame that those who support her have become so enamoured with her.
7398,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck that. I'm moving to the UK in 2 weeks. This is just unappreciated.
7399,<|emo_disgust|> I'm so angry rn
7400,<|emo_disgust|> You die when they decide to fuck your head off
7401,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I'm sorry for your loss.
7402,<|emo_disgust|> The worst though is her face
7403,<|emo_disgust|> I’m the same. I’m disturbed that you choose to disagree with me.
7404,<|emo_disgust|> I hate this too. Why can’t I relate? I want to understand why people are mad at this
7406,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a very lucky guy. He was out there, loud, rude, and had an opinion that pissed off most people on the radio."
7407,"<|emo_disgust|> So this is what I call a ""Fuck off"" note."
7408,<|emo_disgust|> Who are you talking about? We have [NAME] for him
7409,<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell are these...
7410,"<|emo_disgust|> I have a bad feeling about this. Personally, I think it's hilarious... though I can see why people would Dis Like it."
7411,<|emo_disgust|> I don't care why all this shit is happening. Fuck [NAME]
7412,"<|emo_disgust|> A disgusting amount of Sesame oil, god, that would be horrendous."
7415,<|emo_disgust|> > Which is why it's creepy that he doesn't even reply to your message.
7416,<|emo_disgust|> They should do it because it’s fun
7417,<|emo_disgust|> This is a prime example that [NAME] cares about absolutely nothing.
7418,<|emo_disgust|> But it’s a “hockey club” so obviously I’m playing. So what”s a “hockey” for.
7419,<|emo_disgust|> My favorite gusgasm
7420,<|emo_disgust|> The best thing about this story is how outraged most of the reddit community was
7421,"<|emo_disgust|> This is how it's been done before, the [NAME] used this way too. We need to fix this"
7422,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] it's in 2019 and I still want to be there 2019.
7423,<|emo_disgust|> The only bad thing about this is that the other options (besides getting charged for not showing ID) are getting passed on the way :'(
7424,<|emo_disgust|> What you're saying is that there's a huge chunk of white working class men that identify as 'radical' and want abortion... yet somehow blame all other social ills on black people.
7426,<|emo_disgust|> That's weird. What country are you from?/s
7428,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds an awful lot like khorne......
7429,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like im the worst since ever
7430,<|emo_disgust|> This guy is creepy
7431,"<|emo_disgust|> If this is true, it's quite the opposite of what everyone says. As much as I'd love it to be true, it's not. "
7432,<|emo_disgust|> You want us to think it's okay to eat dogs? That is disgusting.
7433,<|emo_disgust|> But the news always makes me feel better...
7434,<|emo_disgust|> i feel really dumb and rude
7436,<|emo_disgust|> What a dog.
7437,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh boy, now you're saying some pretty wild things."
7438,<|emo_disgust|> They’re so gorgeous!
7439,<|emo_disgust|> I can’t even imagine a scenario where I would allow his children to play outside on the front lot without being charged
7440,<|emo_disgust|> Well a shitpost from the r/television subreddit probably isn't gonna get the attention it's due.... but I'm sure you know where to find more.
7441,<|emo_disgust|> Not surprising since his ex is also his stepmom
7442,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating. What a waste of plastic.
7444,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is dumb and will never ever make a good living in this industry
7445,<|emo_disgust|> Oh I hate that as well!
7446,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is that you can have good news and bad news simultaneously.
7447,<|emo_disgust|> And yet I don't think anyone should be surprised if they hear he's the son of an unsuccessful [NAME] politician.
7448,"<|emo_disgust|> You're a horrible human being, and you're going to be brought to justice. I hope that this horrendous event doesn't happen to you ever again."
7449,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] should just get [NAME] off the books for what he did
7450,"<|emo_disgust|> That's an awful amount of Sesame oil, man."
7451,<|emo_disgust|> I hate people like that
7452,"<|emo_disgust|> Your mom is being a horrible, selfish mother. Not to mention a bit of a snob. /s"
7454,"<|emo_disgust|> What a rude and obnoxious quip. [NAME] is a teacher, he doesnt need someone ignorant to teach him."
7455,<|emo_disgust|> They’re all looking miserable here
7456,"<|emo_disgust|> There's no need for anger, but cringe and embarrassment are called for."
7457,"<|emo_disgust|> This person had a mental block on this one, apparently."
7458,<|emo_disgust|> I'm surprised [NAME] let her post that.
7459,<|emo_disgust|> What a weird way to ask a question.
7460,<|emo_disgust|> Because it’s a shitty meme.
7461,<|emo_disgust|> This is the weirdest I've been made to read.
7462,<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting. He should be ashamed for trying to profit from that.
7464,"<|emo_disgust|> I see your post history, it does look suspicious."
7465,<|emo_disgust|> I'm a little sad that [NAME] did get repped but I'll take [NAME] over [NAME] for sure
7466,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird, she seems to enjoy using words like “shitty” and “murderer” That’s kinda disturbing to be sure, but it’s not that uncommon in this day and age!"
7467,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a fucking racist
7468,<|emo_disgust|> And then all the blame fell on his wife...
7469,<|emo_disgust|> That's fucking disgusting. You should be ashamed for spreading such disgusting garbage.
7470,<|emo_disgust|> And why aren’t we fucking paying for the infrastructure and schools that have instead been privatized?
7471,<|emo_disgust|> i hope you feel just really hateful about it
7473,"<|emo_disgust|> This is kinda disgusting, especially since most of you are probably in your late-twenties and early-apostolic phase."
7474,<|emo_disgust|> That's so sad because we should want to improve our health care system but here we are.
7475,<|emo_disgust|> What the actual fuck? They actually did it though.
7477,<|emo_disgust|> How dare they do that to our beautiful game!
7479,<|emo_disgust|> He’s a bit loud and obnoxious in there when he’s snorting coke.
7480,<|emo_disgust|> You're a disgusting stooge for the democrats
7481,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm not a vegan, but damn am I sad. "
7483,<|emo_disgust|> That's... pretty disgusting.
7485,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is terrible, we need a new keeper and [NAME] is worse than [NAME]"
7486,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so hateful with him
7488,<|emo_disgust|> When [NAME] doesn't like your shorts and shortsie
7489,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is in top shape and is eating garbage. He’s really confused now
7490,<|emo_disgust|> When you want to say anything without being screamed at you for doing so.
7492,"<|emo_disgust|> ""We shouldn't talk shop"" is pretty much the same argument anti-discriminationists make as well."
7493,"<|emo_disgust|> I like the slowness of it all, but the fact the head is pointing towards the player is fucking infuriating."
7494,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting. Apt.
7496,<|emo_disgust|> No need for pity!
7497,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that [NAME] doesn't think more women should have their mothers' backs is somehow not a problem. What a weird person he is!
7498,<|emo_disgust|> This man has very odd medical opinions.
7499,<|emo_disgust|> This is a meme about cats not killing our pets. Now why the fuck are pets in this picture?!
7500,<|emo_disgust|> That's such a selfish mentality to have.
7501,<|emo_disgust|> It's hard to make people laugh when your sense of humor is so completely wrong.
7502,<|emo_disgust|> The dude is outey as fuck....
7503,<|emo_disgust|> I don't understand how a racist like you can't get elected. What the fuck are you talking about?
7504,<|emo_disgust|> If they were all looking at the same thing your eyes would be screwed up.
7505,<|emo_disgust|> How come I never wrote that?
7507,<|emo_disgust|> What a pathetic and craven position for the [NAME] to be in.
7508,<|emo_disgust|> Weird we’ve only had 2 seasons of [NAME]
7509,<|emo_disgust|> That's why I’m afraid to fly.
7510,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking bummer
7511,<|emo_disgust|> This is a fake thread
7513,<|emo_disgust|> Just think of the beautiful stories this would be telling about.
7514,<|emo_disgust|> That picture just makes me feel bad for the people who contracted measles.
7516,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking sick game.
7517,<|emo_disgust|> I’m the one who hated [NAME] personally
7518,<|emo_disgust|> I hate saying this but [NAME] is making a lot of noise. We are very close...
7519,<|emo_disgust|> I've seen you've seen this before.. a woman gets drunk and hits a guy. That's awful.
7520,<|emo_disgust|> You’re a badger. Get back in touch with your family. We did everything we could to keep her safe and together.
7521,<|emo_disgust|> What a sick power trip.
7522,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I'm glad your Okay.
7525,<|emo_disgust|> And it’s a terrible problem. People are so complicated.
7526,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I missberg. :(
7527,<|emo_disgust|> The fact it's [RELIGION] is actually quite disturbing.
7528,<|emo_disgust|> Those guys are some sadists.
7529,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking selfish and ignorant prick you are
7530,<|emo_disgust|> Lol no wonder he killed himself
7532,<|emo_disgust|> That’s disgusting. You should be ashamed for spreading such disgusting gossip.
7533,<|emo_disgust|> This guy thought he was on fire. Yikes.
7534,"<|emo_disgust|> People are always on the verge of tears to say that ""it was just a mistake"" but seriously that's the worst you can do to them lol"
7535,<|emo_disgust|> Fuuuuck I'd die right now if I was him.
7536,"<|emo_disgust|> I mean, [NAME] actually did believe in an angelic intervention hereabouts. And that's the stuff that got the shit out both of us."
7539,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm tired, need sleep!"
7540,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like it s very dangerous to have a healthy amount of sugar in your diet
7541,"<|emo_disgust|> They wanted her to ""reject"" [NAME] for being a lousy mom. It's kind of weird."
7542,<|emo_disgust|> But [NAME]...the hate for [NAME] is worse than the hate for [NAME].
7543,<|emo_disgust|> I've been here for 10 days I still gotta hate them.
7544,"<|emo_disgust|> Just an old ass friend trying to hook you up. Not trying to play hard to get, just trying to keep you around for company.....and possibly to grope you."
7545,<|emo_disgust|> This is awful... I understand there’s a ban but what I didn’t expect was for him to post this
7546,<|emo_disgust|> The only place I ever wanted to be... But alas...
7547,<|emo_disgust|> I hate [NAME] so much...
7548,<|emo_disgust|> > How he fits into [NAME] plan I don't get it
7549,<|emo_disgust|> And he’s worse than [NAME] in every category except hits
7550,<|emo_disgust|> I miss [NAME] butt.
7552,<|emo_disgust|> Damn the rangers don’t even have a fan base worth talking about....
7553,<|emo_disgust|> So sorry you are having such trouble. Tried something else but it wasn't very forgiving.
7554,<|emo_disgust|> Now I can’t believe they’re talking about a carpool stop and not a legit festival.
7555,<|emo_disgust|> What a waste of fabric and ingredients.
7556,<|emo_disgust|> So I'm a [RELIGION] [RELIGION] [RELIGION] [RELIGION] and these are some of the worst things I've ever seen.
7557,<|emo_disgust|> What a garbage post
7558,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm just a little envious of [NAME] now, god that's so awesome!"
7559,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is ugly btw
7560,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was out for 2 quarters and [NAME] just shot one... [NAME] shot was worse
7561,<|emo_disgust|> I can’t believe this is the top post. What a joke.
7562,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh shit I just remembered. I think I've been remembering this wrong. Thanks for sharing man, it was a hard lesson. "
7563,<|emo_disgust|> I don't even have any remotely close friend group on here. I've been looking for them on here but it's been far and few between.
7565,<|emo_disgust|> It's so weird how good each team is at defense until 90 minutes into the season.
7566,<|emo_disgust|> I was getting all distressed yesterday wondering why a kid I liked (and had a long standing relationship with) was suddenly this toxic as all hell.
7567,"<|emo_disgust|> If you use your real name, you could go to jail."
7568,<|emo_disgust|> Damnit.
7570,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, all the areas in question have shitty water quality."
7571,<|emo_disgust|> Damn it..
7572,<|emo_disgust|> I don't think that was a sexual advance at all. He was just being a jerk for attention lol.
7573,<|emo_disgust|> This is an example of something that makes you think about taking things way too seriously.
7574,<|emo_disgust|> Oh that sucks good luck man good luck because I really liked him
7575,"<|emo_disgust|> That’s the sad part. Not saying that some parents are bad, mind you. Disputing what the parents themselves did was just as important"
7576,<|emo_disgust|> She could literally cry in her pants.
7579,<|emo_disgust|> I've been catching and loving some of the worst kinds of dubstep.
7580,"<|emo_disgust|> Well as much as I like him, that's just not how I roll!"
7581,<|emo_disgust|> I'm so angry.
7582,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah look at those bushes wow not sure if they're legal but still obnoxious.
7584,<|emo_disgust|> i feel disgusted disgusted and ashamed
7586,<|emo_disgust|> My eyes. Theyre hurting from how furiously they're rolling in my sockets right now
7587,"<|emo_disgust|> You mean 3,000 signatures? Damn we need more than that..."
7588,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was horrible on Sunday
7589,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I’m done with Reddit.
7590,<|emo_disgust|> I had a conversation with one recently and he began by telling me how much I hated him for being so smug. It seemed that at least he was sincere in wanting to rid himself of his pride.
7591,<|emo_disgust|> So weird they're attracted to each other but rejected by society for what they're doing.
7592,<|emo_disgust|> They look so fluffy and sweet.
7593,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird choice of words, but effective for this target group."
7594,"<|emo_disgust|> He also used his position as head of state to pressure other heads of state to be less supportive to China, something no other country has done."
7595,<|emo_disgust|> I don't care what any of you say. I love my children and am a parent in my own right.
7596,<|emo_disgust|> I am not crying... you are!
7599,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like i have to do something or everyone will lose power
7600,<|emo_disgust|> It's a lot more gross than just eating trash.
7601,"<|emo_disgust|> You can't find relief from anger unless you give up on emotion, and for that you'll have to deal with abuse"
7602,"<|emo_disgust|> If there was any doubt, we are giving him an extra day of credit."
7603,<|emo_disgust|> This is so cute. The only problem I have with it is the new hair.
7604,<|emo_disgust|> I hate this. I hate because you're right. Thanks for all the memories. You're all too right.
7605,<|emo_disgust|> A horrible person?
7606,<|emo_disgust|> What a weird thread you helped create
7607,<|emo_disgust|> Well.... it's fucking incredible that [NAME] has become a mod some time ago.
7609,<|emo_disgust|> I'm really sad we didn't get [NAME] back. He was such a nice presence for us.
7610,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a piece of shit. What a piece of shit.
7611,<|emo_disgust|> She is horrible
7612,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is going to fuck [NAME] in the nba this year
7613,<|emo_disgust|> This is just so sad... how are we supposed to make these people feel better when they've been so cruel and insensitive?
7615,"<|emo_disgust|> It's called a flex, what makes it awful is that the flex part is flat.."
7616,"<|emo_disgust|> Lol you want to be a man and not have sex? Go off the deep end, you're past the moon right now."
7617,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I'd love to try the ribs with our sauce on the side but I've never tried before...
7618,<|emo_disgust|> I’d say you’re just weirded out by your own emotions rather than listening more to what people have to say.
7619,<|emo_disgust|> Omg this is the definition of lipstick rape
7620,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling very petty and self Indulgent at the same time
7621,"<|emo_disgust|> But if I did it, it wouldn't be [NAME]!"
7622,<|emo_disgust|> Well fuck I guess it is a *progressive* thing to say to an oil baron
7623,<|emo_disgust|> He can’t handle how bad my husband and I are. I’m not the one who feels ungrateful!
7624,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] and [NAME] are really good to watch, but I've grown to not much because of them :("
7626,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I’m so angry Reddit.
7627,<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry if you had to do this.
7628,<|emo_disgust|> She's not right. But it looks so damn damn creepy!
7629,<|emo_disgust|> That sub sounds horrible and I'm sorry but are there any links to posts on this sub?
7630,"<|emo_disgust|> He is also a drunk and a little bit moody, if his mannerisms were more appropriate for a bartender."
7631,<|emo_disgust|> Those are all terrible tings for a mouthful haha
7633,<|emo_disgust|> I've always wondered how a body comes off looking this way...
7635,<|emo_disgust|> i can make my feelings about him heard but it was just the way he was speaking of himself not me
7636,<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting honestly.
7637,<|emo_disgust|> My wife's birthday today as well! She's also our anniversary. I wish I could have her birthday but we're almost killing it.
7639,<|emo_disgust|> This is scary! Knew [NAME] and her. One of my best friends ended up killing herself after this.
7641,"<|emo_disgust|> It’s not a terrible idea, but I don’t think it’s the best.... Personally I wanna do one hell of a thing before I die though"
7642,<|emo_disgust|> It is extremely rude.
7643,<|emo_disgust|> This was clearly a terrible call. Probably the worst I've ever seen.
7644,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah my point has been made. You can't just assume anything.
7647,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is in the bottom of the league for that reason alone. I love how the front office just doesn’t care.
7648,"<|emo_disgust|> She has horrible taste, thats what makes it bad"
7649,<|emo_disgust|> Shut up and stop trolling. You're not funny
7651,<|emo_disgust|> This guy needs help. Is he on tranquilizers or something?
7653,<|emo_disgust|> No one loves me
7654,<|emo_disgust|> It's awful.
7655,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird, I think I’d go with ""housecat""."
7656,"<|emo_disgust|> She said: ""I'm not going to tell you how to think or how to dress"". And I said: ""......"" *aggressively* "".....you're not a woman"""
7657,"<|emo_disgust|> Why the fuck do we play in January? It’s horrible, we already get so hot."
7658,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that’s a bitter taste
7659,"<|emo_disgust|> You are a disgusting human being, you should be ashamed of yourself."
7660,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, there are definitely racist undertones in this video."
7661,<|emo_disgust|> You can't pick a favorite color. Which brings us to the question...
7662,<|emo_disgust|> Just the name of it gave me goosebumps!
7663,<|emo_disgust|> My husband and I have been having terrible diarrhea and vomiting almost daily for the past week. It’s caused by a virus that’s caused by E.coli.
7664,<|emo_disgust|> No. That is beyond disgusting.
7665,<|emo_disgust|> He got the better offer
7666,<|emo_disgust|> I don't think we should be surprised if [NAME] doesn't give it back to them.
7667,<|emo_disgust|> But that poor janitor.
7668,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird. Maybe [NAME] is half right. Still, horrible."
7669,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn. He took a huge swing at [NAME] like a goddamn shot, and [NAME] just deflected the kick"
7670,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing that can possibly happen is for a [NAME] freak to wind up in Catskill.
7671,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh wow, hate that. "
7672,"<|emo_disgust|> I see [NAME] and [NAME] all the time, [NAME] on a lot of their songs sounds bad but still."
7673,<|emo_disgust|> That was such a terrible open shot.... I can't believe he missed that
7674,"<|emo_disgust|> ""We've resolved all of our issues"" What an unpleasant surprise. "
7675,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you.
7676,<|emo_disgust|> That looks disgustingly fake
7678,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] he got fucking dicked in the head
7679,"<|emo_disgust|> Fucking, we're not in the playoffs, [NAME] is. Shut up, [NAME]! "
7680,"<|emo_disgust|> I've been doing this for over 20 years, it's disgusting. "
7681,<|emo_disgust|> The secondhand panic I feel from watching this is deafening.
7683,<|emo_disgust|> This thread makes me wish they had a subreddit fortf Just a general reminder that you need to make friends Not the least bit cringe
7684,"<|emo_disgust|> He just has this weird ""I hate everybody in this room"" thing going on."
7685,<|emo_disgust|> That is just disgusting.
7686,<|emo_disgust|> The only negative they can think of is his hypocrisy
7687,<|emo_disgust|> I don’t understand how it is hate speech to call someone a hater
7688,<|emo_disgust|> So you are a horrible person.
7689,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds more disgusting than the top of a toilet.
7693,<|emo_disgust|> It's a horrible meme.
7694,<|emo_disgust|> In real life it's a painful experience. I'm just saying it's on his mind in a video.
7696,<|emo_disgust|> You are so creepy
7698,<|emo_disgust|> It’s kinda disgusting how society treats these issues but the Japanese way is by saying it literally
7699,<|emo_disgust|> i do feel mad at my house
7701,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I don't like it when I'm wrong"" is a pretty good list of things I've said."
7702,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing worse than this guy is a woman that does it to you
7703,<|emo_disgust|> This is truly horrifying.
7704,<|emo_disgust|> And that was before he was found guilty of rape. Fuck off.
7705,<|emo_disgust|> I'm at a loss for words.
7706,<|emo_disgust|> Lol no one has told you that yet? FFS.
7707,<|emo_disgust|> > because it's a publicity stunt? Fuck off.
7708,<|emo_disgust|> You're a pretty angry elf
7709,<|emo_disgust|> So true. I spent years in a similar environment and it devastated me.
7710,"<|emo_disgust|> I didn't think that was possible until I saw that post and thought ""I can actually do this...I'll try""."
7713,<|emo_disgust|> There is a fine line between art and trash.
7714,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, lord that poor sap"
7715,<|emo_disgust|> This is some of the weirdest generalization I've read today. Sorry for being optimistic but there just seems to be an awful lot of this.
7716,<|emo_disgust|> Well I've read some terrible reviews of it so I figure it's a bit more than a ruse. But that sounds awful.
7718,<|emo_disgust|> You shut your mouth for talking about all this other stuff when you did it. Shut your mouth for whatever makes you think it is worth talking about. You shut your mouth for cowardice
7719,<|emo_disgust|> The guy just looks like he's in drag
7720,<|emo_disgust|> She’s an angry elf smh
7721,"<|emo_disgust|> I have no idea what that is, but I'm going to be extremely, extremely disturbed by this"
7722,"<|emo_disgust|> Ouch, now I'm crying"
7723,<|emo_disgust|> I'm more worried about [NAME] getting injured in the first place
7724,<|emo_disgust|> This is the second time I've seen that in a year and it’s disgusting. You’re in for a lot worse then even I thought.
7727,<|emo_disgust|> Oh stop it
7728,<|emo_disgust|> I am a terrible internet person.
7729,<|emo_disgust|> This is some of the worst passing I've ever seen. That's probably from him not knowing how to read the defense
7730,<|emo_disgust|> What an unbelievable coward.
7731,"<|emo_disgust|> It's also weird to have a name for the planet that's so weird, maybe planetapalooza."
7732,<|emo_disgust|> It must suck to be so boring that you can't pick a sides!
7733,<|emo_disgust|> i feel very tortured
7735,<|emo_disgust|> That’s awful. I’ve never seen such bad taste in my life!
7736,<|emo_disgust|> That is shockingly uncool.
7737,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling disgusted thinking about the way i put my life together lately
7738,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking hate [NAME]!
7739,<|emo_disgust|> I'd be creeped out.
7740,<|emo_disgust|> i feel disgusted right now with myself
7741,"<|emo_disgust|> I have no idea what you're on about, but it sounds like it's quite possibly the dumbest thing I've ever heard."
7742,<|emo_disgust|> I’m more worried about the baby than the wife. [NAME] needs to step up
7744,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is making me angry tbh
7745,<|emo_disgust|> This comment is one of worst I've ever seen.
7746,<|emo_disgust|> He lost his shoes outside of church that day. He's one weirdo.
7747,<|emo_disgust|> Just horrible.
7748,"<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest thing is he's the opposite of [NAME] - nice, chill guy, but someone who is utterly obsessed with his celebrity"
7749,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking crybaby.
7750,<|emo_disgust|> This person is so very evil.
7751,"<|emo_disgust|> I’m on Twitter and it sucks, I really do."
7752,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck she gets paid well. So what.
7753,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck a newspaper
7754,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking lame argument.
7755,<|emo_disgust|> He's not wrong. She's a horrible person.
7756,<|emo_disgust|> Wow.. Thanks! That's terrible he wasnt lying..
7757,"<|emo_disgust|> But now there's a gun violence problem in the U.S. Because of this law, maybe?"
7759,<|emo_disgust|> i also said what ive been doing but i feel pretty dumb saying that
7760,<|emo_disgust|> The saddest part is everyone seems to be driving a Prius despite this.
7761,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I hate fags"" is actually a great one because it can be extended to include almost anyone"
7762,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] that was so dumb lol. he could have called the cops and said ""my parents are going to be found""..."
7763,<|emo_disgust|> i always feel pretty offended by people who can not do some things i can
7764,"<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking lous, but whatever."
7765,<|emo_disgust|> The one on the right looks like a dead rams fan.
7766,<|emo_disgust|> I'm a lousy bed. I can't keep this up!
7767,<|emo_disgust|> I agree entirely. This show is so awful that these minor things add up to some pretty big issues.
7768,<|emo_disgust|> Weird how you could just take something like that and use it in your own head to think you're smart
7771,<|emo_disgust|> This is terrible... I’m so sorry!💖
7772,<|emo_disgust|> Thats it I am out. Have fun trying to get it back.
7773,"<|emo_disgust|> This is super gross how they're dressing up like animals, it's just terrible."
7774,<|emo_disgust|> They're still a jobs program but with an even worse standard.
7775,<|emo_disgust|> I hate the r/Tropes4U subreddit.
7777,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah and that sauce smells bad in there too.
7778,<|emo_disgust|> In my day I could have killed up to 20 people with my bare hands!
7779,<|emo_disgust|> The [NAME] and [NAME] are sooo much older lol lol.
7780,"<|emo_disgust|> The real worst of the worst, but still some dude tried to sell me burgers at the drive through. "
7781,<|emo_disgust|> I really hate [NAME] and think he should never play for an organization that drafts him.
7782,"<|emo_disgust|> She sounds hideous, disgusting, and borderline mental abuse. Truly, this woman should be locked up."
7783,"<|emo_disgust|> > So true, I'm surprised most people agree with this."
7784,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has lost his shit.
7785,<|emo_disgust|> I'd rather lose than put up 35 points
7786,<|emo_disgust|> So this person is basically just a psychopath. A little worse than the full on sociopath.
7787,"<|emo_disgust|> And as much as I'd love that, I hate Reddit "
7788,<|emo_disgust|> This is so creepy and weird. Good riddance to awful rubbish.
7789,<|emo_disgust|> Who are these dreadful people
7791,<|emo_disgust|> That was such an ill-advised call
7792,<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell thought he was dead...
7793,"<|emo_disgust|> This was a bad open-hand slap. If it wasn't for the refs, I would have probably hit him hard with it."
7794,<|emo_disgust|> >The only person I've thought of that actually liked being in a video game is [NAME] and that must have been pretty awful.
7795,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, I hope all goes well with [NAME]. I mean they seem to be both genuinely bad ass in deference."
7796,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't think being cruel to animals is a good thing, it's cruelty to humanity."
7797,<|emo_disgust|> I don't like your answer and I don't like yours being wrong.
7798,<|emo_disgust|> The fact you think this is trolling is disturbing.
7799,<|emo_disgust|> Not a problem. Sorry if I sounded that was rude.
7800,<|emo_disgust|> This is awful. Are we to believe she is 100% truthful because what she said was not lies? Wow.
7803,"<|emo_disgust|> This is awful. If my kid watched this, he would say, “it wasn’t a doll” right back at dad."
7804,<|emo_disgust|> She hates [NAME] too. What a fucking basant
7805,<|emo_disgust|> >the reason why I left is because I realized [NAME] isn't a fascist What a fucking idiot lol.
7807,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst pass I've ever thrown.
7808,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, you can’t even tell the difference between milk and cream when it’s hot. "
7809,<|emo_disgust|> I was being sarcastic lol
7810,<|emo_disgust|> Now this is the crap I've been waiting for
7812,<|emo_disgust|> You said you knew [NAME] was a bony old bastard.
7813,"<|emo_disgust|> I honestly wish the two biggest ones on the left were up, I think the ground game and defense could take a beating without the big name lefty"
7814,<|emo_disgust|> But the problem IS he wants to be president and it’s disgusting that we keep letting him run even though his track record is abysmal
7816,<|emo_disgust|> It's an ugly duckling but I'm happy the game actually tries to slow him down and places him in dangerous areas more often than not. Feels pretty bad actually.
7819,<|emo_disgust|> Those are some ugly baby photos.
7822,"<|emo_disgust|> They got some weird looks and a giant ""oh you're a muh racist"" sign at the gate. Truly pissed off."
7823,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, I guess the most popular girl lost her virginity outside of marriage."
7824,"<|emo_disgust|> It's just a video, calm your down"
7825,<|emo_disgust|> What nonsense.
7826,<|emo_disgust|> I feel bad for the people in New Jersey who have the luxury of an apartment valued at less than their home state.
7827,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you question the existence of [NAME]
7828,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] can’t shut this down! Can’t do it, damn [NAME]! Just stop now!"
7829,"<|emo_disgust|> How dare you not find domestic abuse funny! By extension, all abuse is somehow OK! /s"
7832,<|emo_disgust|> It's one of the worst ways to be a woman.
7833,<|emo_disgust|> What an awful way to read this. Disgusting.
7834,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] a bitch...
7836,<|emo_disgust|> The lack of any connection between these characters actually makes it hard to care. What a waste of potential.
7837,"<|emo_disgust|> I still like beer, damn [NAME]!"
7838,<|emo_disgust|> That [NAME] was indecisive last week.
7839,<|emo_disgust|> It sucks that there are people out there who think this way.
7840,<|emo_disgust|> In my day I actually worked for 20 years at a McDonald's and thought I was the luckiest person in the building.
7841,<|emo_disgust|> So your brother is a rape apologist and your mom a bigot? What a bizarre twist!
7843,<|emo_disgust|> Lol. I could have used that as an example of a bad character.
7844,<|emo_disgust|> It’s the worst when the complaining vegans say it’s all natural because they’re vegan... I don’t see how that’s wrong.
7845,"<|emo_disgust|> He had a very publically disgusting relationship with his mother. He's in his late 30s now, and is utterly repulsive."
7846,"<|emo_disgust|> He has a weird way of saying ""hi"" that makes me semi-shiver at the thought of it occasionally."
7847,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird I came across this subreddit yesterday, it was posted yesterday and the image was fresh for a second or so."
7848,<|emo_disgust|> i could feel my stomach aching already my mouth was feeling funny
7849,<|emo_disgust|> The fact [NAME] was able to get her into a halfway decent relationship at all is a real problem...
7851,"<|emo_disgust|> That is odd. Also, does anyone actually care about your health?"
7852,<|emo_disgust|> That's not how it works anywhere. The feds shut down Craigslist
7853,<|emo_disgust|> This guy is just the worst - the other players said nothing even compared
7854,"<|emo_disgust|> >""We hate them not because they're wrong, but because their liberalism doesn't involve hatred of liberals."""
7855,<|emo_disgust|> My parents are gonna kill me when they find out
7856,<|emo_disgust|> They both wrong
7857,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing that could save everyone is a miracle
7858,<|emo_disgust|> What a weird way to spell sink.
7859,<|emo_disgust|> Now I'm crying before work thanks a lot 😂
7860,<|emo_disgust|> i still feel like a bastard i dont really like christmas
7861,<|emo_disgust|> i cant do anything about the child but feel personally offended by all the talk
7862,"<|emo_disgust|> But even worse, like, *ever*. This is just sad."
7863,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] this is just sad
7864,<|emo_disgust|> i could feel a little frustrated already
7866,<|emo_disgust|> The fact she assaulted you is not a defense. It's a defense that needs to be used more often.
7867,"<|emo_disgust|> I would like to know why those women are thinking this, then."
7868,<|emo_disgust|> That looks disgusting.
7869,<|emo_disgust|> Lol you are fucking retarded
7870,<|emo_disgust|> i am not feeling dissatisfied yet
7871,"<|emo_disgust|> I’m not a politician, I’m a human being and I’ve also had depression. Your memes are cute even though they’re wrong."
7872,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking Real Madrid
7873,<|emo_disgust|> This just made me feel worse than the poor swimmer who fell
7875,<|emo_disgust|> i feel disgusted that the only person who can stop the monster in his tracks is my own dad
7876,<|emo_disgust|> That’s creepy
7877,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] would have loved that
7878,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing you can do is ask for it. Fuck off.
7879,<|emo_disgust|> That’s a lot of karma...
7881,<|emo_disgust|> Who does that? Who makes the man tip the next food?
7884,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] who took his kid to the junk yard
7885,<|emo_disgust|> Lol you're a weirdo.
7886,"<|emo_disgust|> No fucking clue, what a fucking liar."
7887,<|emo_disgust|> If we continue we are doomed.
7888,<|emo_disgust|> If this is true it is amazing to hear that there are even more that believe this
7889,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing that could possibly make those posts even worse is for her to fake it as well
7890,<|emo_disgust|> Oh geez that.
7891,<|emo_disgust|> Lol I’m a horrible person
7892,"<|emo_disgust|> The worst is working with dealerships. They will happily engage in contract killing, which is illegal and unethical."
7893,<|emo_disgust|> No. That is disgusting. No one should act like this to you..
7894,"<|emo_disgust|> You need to stop posting about them, they're creepy."
7896,<|emo_disgust|> But because it's a woman's job to expose them. Look at them. Don't be disgusting
7897,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is still before you're even born
7898,"<|emo_disgust|> I don’t know his or her background, but I think it would be hard to find much worse mediaite personality than [NAME]"
7899,<|emo_disgust|> They're weird sex workers.
7900,"<|emo_disgust|> That's just...I don't want him doing crazy stuff just because he's a hero, that's such an obvious crutch for someone like him."
7901,"<|emo_disgust|> Not to worry I had them, thank goodness!"
7902,<|emo_disgust|> Why is this still not banned
7903,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn her!
7904,<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting. The last thing we need in our schools. A dozenth grade history teacher like that should not be teaching.
7905,"<|emo_disgust|> You don't care about the job, what's your point?"
7907,<|emo_disgust|> He’s terrible
7908,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like it took this man about minutes of research and a lot of swear words to come up with this one
7910,<|emo_disgust|> Damn we need a [NAME] moment; it's just so damn painful to watch
7911,<|emo_disgust|> He was elected twice and is now making his third run for re-election. He's a very dangerous choice for Democrats. 
7912,<|emo_disgust|> > It would cause a terrible mess > You just don't care about the environment then
7913,<|emo_disgust|> How could anyone possibly understand the satire if they didn’t watch The Office constantly?
7914,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh no, I didn't read it, I've got a bad feeling about the quote thing. What does your dad do?"
7915,"<|emo_disgust|> > They still have not helped to get off the ground. Just because its politics doesn't mean its an excuse. What excuse, exactly?"
7917,<|emo_disgust|> That was a brutal 3v3
7918,<|emo_disgust|> The “I“m sorry you” is pretty cringe.
7919,<|emo_disgust|> >[NAME] this is the new kid on the block I feel bad for this new kid
7920,<|emo_disgust|> That guy looks like the middleweight champ from cage.
7922,<|emo_disgust|> That's so scary. I hope they get her okay... then she can start the school year. :(
7923,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a horrible person..behave yourself and don’t let her judging affect you
7924,<|emo_disgust|> I didn’t know [NAME] said that.
7925,<|emo_disgust|> i feel tortured because i want to have them all
7926,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm just going to hit ""back"" now. This is extremely awkward"
7927,<|emo_disgust|> No no I’m talking about a potential multiple different sexual situations
7928,<|emo_disgust|> I really hate [NAME]..
7929,<|emo_disgust|> Those legs are thick and probably stank.
7933,<|emo_disgust|> The least offensive way of saying they hate women is in a population survey.
7934,<|emo_disgust|> It’s disgusting how much of the [RELIGION] community regards LGBT people as second class human beings.
7935,"<|emo_disgust|> Fuck this, I was going to play a card game or something "
7936,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking hate [NAME] he is.
7937,"<|emo_disgust|> The worst kind of pizza, the kind with skin on it that doesn't brown as soon as it comes out."
7938,<|emo_disgust|> i was feeling pretty resentful of the lack of anything i could do
7939,<|emo_disgust|> It had become something of a symbol for antisemitism. The [NAME] wearing bandanna actually made me feel a little bit envious.
7940,<|emo_disgust|> You better not try any harder then. This will get you a good bashing in the future
7941,<|emo_disgust|> This doesn't make any sense...
7942,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] a fucking moron....
7943,<|emo_disgust|> This is an acceptable comment on here?
7944,<|emo_disgust|> That’s a terrible amount of bp for what is essentially a rookie card?
7945,"<|emo_disgust|> So she did it, it was just a matter of time before her."
7947,<|emo_disgust|> That’s a hot pic Shame he did/ doesn’t deserve it
7950,"<|emo_disgust|> ""ian genocide"" - the term was used in the film of the same name (the UN said the term was genocide)"
7951,"<|emo_disgust|> There's something called a ""Dirty Dozen."" It's the zany twelve shitheads you'll meet in ruin."
7952,"<|emo_disgust|> I thought everyone hated [NAME] but personally I did, he was pretty terrible."
7953,<|emo_disgust|> That’s disgusting! #tcot
7954,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] why is it an H CoE change I feel like its stupid
7955,<|emo_disgust|> i can t stop feeling so fucked up
7956,<|emo_disgust|> Your entire account is a fucking disgrace
7958,"<|emo_disgust|> Lol why would someone call that ""tone deaf"" if the person using it isn't hearing it? This is like one of those ""tone deaf"" things"
7959,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I know a couple of people that did. It was so horrifying honestly. The abuse was just mind-boggling.
7960,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] isn't even the worst coach in Chargers history, but he was certainly a nasty asshole."
7961,<|emo_disgust|> I did not know that the word divorce was being used so colloquially.
7962,"<|emo_disgust|> If we can't create jobs, who will? The answer is the same. Those greedy, ignorant, immoral people are jobs from the past that we must destroy."
7963,"<|emo_disgust|> I mean, you do realize that's really weird in light of everything else going on."
7964,<|emo_disgust|> I hate the way your brain works OP. Always did enjoy bugs bunny humour.
7965,"<|emo_disgust|> There are worse things, like living with 100% pagans"
7966,"<|emo_disgust|> If my son had wanted to tell me the lyrics to the track from teen horror movie, we could have sued tooth and nail"
7967,<|emo_disgust|> How is it racist? I'm not saying the game is *ugly* I'm just saying the culture fucked up so badly
7968,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] a bastard man
7969,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry you had that experience, it could have been much worse. "
7970,<|emo_disgust|> There’s a problem with not understanding internet memes well enough
7971,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] IS DARE TO Braid any women.
7972,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like the worst of a lot
7973,<|emo_disgust|> This is terrible.
7975,"<|emo_disgust|> No, but it’s pretty disheartening to hear of any form of violence. "
7976,<|emo_disgust|> Just shitpost
7977,<|emo_disgust|> Because they want to. This is their reality. They just want to be heard and they're going to have to be heard on a very big scale. This is horrific.
7978,<|emo_disgust|> The real worst kept secret is probably the one where he gets to see your penis after you have sex.
7979,"<|emo_disgust|> This is a bit much. If you have children with her, this is dangerous territory for you."
7980,<|emo_disgust|> That’s beyond disgusting
7982,<|emo_disgust|> People have been wrong about this too. It's not because they don't believe in science but because they don't accept it.
7985,"<|emo_disgust|> What?! I'm so used to hearing of these hideous attacks, but this is worse."
7986,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a little guy that can barely hold a stick up high while flying.
7987,<|emo_disgust|> The only bad thing I can think of is [NAME] actually saying these things.
7988,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst starting 11 I have ever seen.
7990,"<|emo_disgust|> It’s weird that it was ableist to simply say ""race"" as ""sex"" and call them both ""homoerotic"""
7991,<|emo_disgust|> The only positive thing is he didn't use them as bombs.
7992,<|emo_disgust|> That was worst defense we've seen all season.
7993,<|emo_disgust|> I'm sure it must have been horrible.
7995,<|emo_disgust|> You're a horrible person for saying that. Hugs.
7996,<|emo_disgust|> So you're a [NAME] if you ever said that about [NAME].
7997,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah he's not perfect but he's pretty damn good. I love the guys on this sub.
7999,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, and it seems like you can't do much besides hug"
8000,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] would like to know why they're letting him do that to them all the fucking time.
8001,<|emo_disgust|> This video is trash. Don't waste your time.
8002,<|emo_disgust|> Wow she is... pretty awful.
8003,<|emo_disgust|> Because you probably don't know much else besides the hatred and ignorance that has been bubbling up for the last couple months.
8006,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not disgusted by gross stuff. Gags are gross stuff. But this is just disgusting.
8013,<|emo_disgust|> We have a lot of them...
8015,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst I've seen. Take my upvote.
8016,<|emo_disgust|> Because he's stupid.
8017,<|emo_disgust|> No thanks.
8018,<|emo_disgust|> This is worse than [NAME] awful mask.
8019,<|emo_disgust|> The reason why I hate him so much is how much I loved him within the first month of his assuming the throne.
8020,<|emo_disgust|> My favorite! It’s just the fog and rain and it’s absolutely beautiful
8022,<|emo_disgust|> He’s still a weird guy
8023,<|emo_disgust|> He’s creepy.
8024,<|emo_disgust|> Oh shit they also had a booth with projection-movies
8025,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I’m scared to fly.
8026,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating but true lol
8027,<|emo_disgust|> That's really sexist.
8028,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is getting fired here. There’s no way he thinks he is. Fuck off.
8029,<|emo_disgust|> The least disgusting option.
8031,<|emo_disgust|> Those ears. What are they made out of?
8032,<|emo_disgust|> Those are some disgusting pockets to have on your back
8033,<|emo_disgust|> i feel a little weird seeing a picture of me in that dress
8034,<|emo_disgust|> My whole life’s been a lie
8035,<|emo_disgust|> I thought I was the only one. It's even worse they say it's best to take 10 years without having a child.
8036,"<|emo_disgust|> This was awful. But oh [NAME] my [NAME], no. Not when [NAME] gets down with a freak toe on the ice."
8038,"<|emo_disgust|> I hate going without pants. I mean, sometimes, but other times I just get absolutely gross."
8039,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I hope so
8040,<|emo_disgust|> It's a weird thing people do.
8042,<|emo_disgust|> That’s weird btw
8043,"<|emo_disgust|> In the comments next to that, a woman is furious because ""man"" doesn't have her back."
8044,<|emo_disgust|> I didn't get a reply...
8046,"<|emo_disgust|> You're telling me that I hate people here, then?"
8047,"<|emo_disgust|> You're an ugly, ugly, ugly turd."
8049,<|emo_disgust|> Well that sucks. That's a lot worse than the original offer.
8050,"<|emo_disgust|> That's just...rid. What they should have done is just kept pushing him back and forth until they started to tire him out, which would leave them with less time for injury"
8051,"<|emo_disgust|> Worst case scenario, he'll go down as the most expensive ever. "
8053,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh wait, no, [NAME] "
8054,<|emo_disgust|> It’s creepy and weird. VWP
8055,"<|emo_disgust|> Your friends are the problem, not you."
8057,"<|emo_disgust|> Omg that's a horrible idea, anyone know what or where exactly you're going with this?"
8059,<|emo_disgust|> What a bummer. Not to be compared to [NAME] or [NAME] but I had a pretty good career before these two.
8061,"<|emo_disgust|> My friend is a cop.... They know he's a cop, so they ask him for his badge number so they can harass him whenever he gets stopped."
8063,<|emo_disgust|> Damn you!
8064,<|emo_disgust|> I still can't believe you came out as a [NAME].
8065,<|emo_disgust|> The real worst of the lot is probably the fake tights.
8067,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not crying... you're laughing!
8068,<|emo_disgust|> Oh wow! You are in for a surprise...
8069,<|emo_disgust|> The worst part about it is all the people commenting they don't even know anymore about it or care.
8070,<|emo_disgust|> Sooooo many kikes.
8071,<|emo_disgust|> Oh I wasnt expecting the hate either
8072,<|emo_disgust|> She got it after the video had been made public and people started talking about how bad [NAME] is. It was really bad until [NAME] herself finally came out and said she wasn't sorry.
8073,<|emo_disgust|> Shut up [NAME] - full stop!
8074,"<|emo_disgust|> OHHHHH, THAT ONE GIVES US THE flashback"
8075,<|emo_disgust|> You're the worst kind of person.
8076,<|emo_disgust|> He actually looks so pissed.
8078,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] stop
8082,<|emo_disgust|> I would also say it's weird that he says he's doing because he's doing it as a cry for help rather than a realization of his true self
8083,<|emo_disgust|> You will always experience moments of peak discontent
8084,<|emo_disgust|> Oh damn that was ugly
8085,<|emo_disgust|> This is just pathetic. All I saw was [NAME] in his worst form
8087,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, it’s you again! This time around, you’re an angry old troll trying to shame you. /sreetings."
8088,"<|emo_disgust|> But since it is such a long post, I'll list the good stuff first!"
8089,<|emo_disgust|> He’s creepy in person
8092,<|emo_disgust|> That motherfucker knows his fucking business.
8094,<|emo_disgust|> What the actual fuck? No deal
8095,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh look, it's your edit history, you dirty dog."
8096,<|emo_disgust|> I fucking hate [NAME] and the Sixers
8097,<|emo_disgust|> They made it tough.
8098,"<|emo_disgust|> It's so weird to look at, especially in summer."
8099,<|emo_disgust|> What a weird way to ask a question about sexual assault.
8100,<|emo_disgust|> i was walking around feeling greedy and then about halfway through the day i looked down at my phone and began snooping
8101,<|emo_disgust|> This is a sad comment.
8102,"<|emo_disgust|> Lol, you cant even believe people still care about animal suffering then"
8103,<|emo_disgust|> This kid is a child molester. What a child prostitute.
8105,<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell thought he’s toxic
8106,<|emo_disgust|> That poor janitor!
8109,"<|emo_disgust|> That’s disgusting. Disgusting, disgusting."
8110,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah it kinda sucks now.
8112,<|emo_disgust|> I'm just a weirdo.. I'm just a weirdo.
8113,<|emo_disgust|> I think its natural to want to control what your friends think about you.
8114,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, fuck the tax haven thing. You suck at planning and are just completely unable to engage with any sort of challenge. "
8115,<|emo_disgust|> The most disgusting thing I've ever seen. Take my upvote and go away.
8116,<|emo_disgust|> What a rude and unnecessary way to ask a question. /s
8117,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] are a cult
8118,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst thing I've seen on Reddit today.
8120,"<|emo_disgust|> Ooooh, my heart!"
8121,<|emo_disgust|> There is no shame in saying fuck your boyfriend
8122,<|emo_disgust|> The first half is pretty bad tbh
8123,"<|emo_disgust|> I mean you can have a guy walk up and down a busy thoroughfare with his hat on, you know the signs warn drivers to use extra care."
8126,<|emo_disgust|> i didnt feel that i could get distracted
8127,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, you mean season 6? "
8128,<|emo_disgust|> They are all nothing but a pack of mean old dirty old hags.
8129,<|emo_disgust|> Damn you for trusting us!
8130,<|emo_disgust|> So we have a new suspect in custody!? I mean no one out there feels surprised that he is being charged with some sort of crime
8133,<|emo_disgust|> You have to be an uneducated twat to believe all those people are teachers.
8134,<|emo_disgust|> You're a monster.
8135,<|emo_disgust|> He said this a few weeks ago. I think we agree with him.
8138,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you question [NAME] about [NAME] having a heart. I doubt he even has one.
8139,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that’s a nasty pic omg
8140,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is getting younger, fatter, and stronger"
8142,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm not crying, you're laughing!"
8143,<|emo_disgust|> It's a weird thing people do
8145,<|emo_disgust|> The one with all the flamingo shit??? Shit is getting out of hand at the ranch.
8146,<|emo_disgust|> > Which is weird because it also sounds like women who are dissatisfied with their gyms are doing it too.
8147,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so hated and i know im wrong but i just cant stop myself from feeling it
8148,<|emo_disgust|> When your 18 and do a sex offenders. You're 30-45 and still doing stupid shit.
8149,"<|emo_disgust|> You have no shame. Go live your life as an insecure, disgusting piece of shit. "
8151,<|emo_disgust|> A creepy old man with a stethoscope in his hand.
8152,"<|emo_disgust|> This is creepy and weird and yes, yes, yes...but I think you have a really good idea of who [NAME] is."
8153,<|emo_disgust|> It’s so freaking creepy
8154,<|emo_disgust|> I'm still waiting on a fucking ex partner to actually end our relationship.
8155,<|emo_disgust|> This is horrible... I'll be honest; I thought you were talking about how much I hated your job as a judge...
8156,<|emo_disgust|> People who buy those clothes are a little bit idiot. They suppose to be aware that the clothes are made with polyester not polyester.
8157,<|emo_disgust|> Wow now I think of it ahh...haha
8158,<|emo_disgust|> A.Gross. B.Troll. C.Witty. D.Troll. E.Gross. F.Troll.Gross.Ftroll.
8159,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so fucked up and im just lonely on the internet and just kind of a guy
8160,"<|emo_disgust|> I mean, she’s a pretty hot gossip."
8161,<|emo_disgust|> My worst fear is catching colds
8162,<|emo_disgust|> She’s a disgusting person inside and out
8164,"<|emo_disgust|> I know more about them than you do, and even I can tell you that not all women engage in these behaviors. "
8165,<|emo_disgust|> And the fuck is wrong with it
8166,<|emo_disgust|> i feel tortured to see something so horrifying right here
8167,<|emo_disgust|> How is it racist?
8169,"<|emo_disgust|> When I told him he should stay away from the baby, he started threatening me more"
8170,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is awful for that hire, he should get a lot of blame."
8171,"<|emo_disgust|> > They just have a very specific, yet apparently very powerful, reason to hate the state. I guess the state should make the laws as well?"
8172,<|emo_disgust|> Because they hate the U.S. and are against British rule.
8173,<|emo_disgust|> I'm saying they can't pick and choose and say what they want about anything. It's tantamount to saying it's not election or something.
8174,<|emo_disgust|> I'm angry at everyone.
8175,<|emo_disgust|> We just lost a close game which is why our focus is on the road now
8176,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't know who [NAME] is, but I've heard terrible things from him."
8177,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is playing stupid in this game
8179,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, the [NAME] are really f'n out there."
8180,<|emo_disgust|> People hate change. It's slow and frustrating and takes time.
8181,<|emo_disgust|> A shitpost after a shitpost.
8182,"<|emo_disgust|> Lol, I was wondering if you could tell me if I was being weird."
8183,"<|emo_disgust|> I know...its been a rough offseason we all know, but ive just been feeling really discontent lately, and its not helped by the fact that I have about 5k upvotes for this sub it seems."
8184,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is the worst Manager in Footballer's history
8185,<|emo_disgust|> Oh I don't care about [NAME] story I just want to see her ass on the dating scene
8186,"<|emo_disgust|> No, for the most part, most people do. In some rare cases, though, it really can be. "
8187,<|emo_disgust|> Damn is going to be a tough task for him to get his act together for two entire years despite the fact he's been clean for far longer.
8188,<|emo_disgust|> You are a disgrace to humankind
8189,<|emo_disgust|> It’s so creepy!
8190,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck yea!
8191,"<|emo_disgust|> So disgusting. First was the car, which is worse."
8192,<|emo_disgust|> i feel that i am a very dangerous person
8193,<|emo_disgust|> Well it does suck but at least it's not a giant flaming ruin surrounded by trees
8195,<|emo_disgust|> That's so disgusting.
8196,"<|emo_disgust|> When she said, ""I love if they don't have children but not this one"" I felt terrible for her! "
8198,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is having two jobs
8203,<|emo_disgust|> i feel kinda obnoxious for getting coffee before dark so i am actually going to have to do it
8204,<|emo_disgust|> I feel bad for both parents. What a scenario.
8205,<|emo_disgust|> [RELIGION] is the problem and the reason behind so many ISIS/ISIL/ISLAMIs and so much violence in the west.
8206,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that it's a remake is so weird.
8208,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck I want to see some of the stuff these guys have on their T shirts
8209,<|emo_disgust|> >The guy with the bandana on his head really looks like [NAME] and [NAME].<
8210,<|emo_disgust|> The only positive thing to come out of all this is that [NAME] has given birth to a daughter. I'm proud mommy
8212,<|emo_disgust|> In the worst of the rain I could see the flooding and wondered where all the rubbish was.
8213,"<|emo_disgust|> In real life [NAME] is an attractive pretty girl but in this movie she's an ugly, fat ugly piece of shit."
8214,<|emo_disgust|> This fucking ad
8216,<|emo_disgust|> And there I was complaining about how long it took me to get my ass kicked.
8217,<|emo_disgust|> The saddest thing here is everyone loves him.
8218,<|emo_disgust|> They’re taking it upon themselves to police your comments. I’m insulted.
8219,<|emo_disgust|> I know a couple of us are 20-somethings and still our parents are our biggest obstacles.
8221,<|emo_disgust|> I don’t blame you for laughing at this. People like that are just sickening!
8223,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, this is the kind of stuff I enjoy writing about. Those women are awful."
8224,<|emo_disgust|> My ex is getting a divorce. My only argument was she took his shoes.
8226,"<|emo_disgust|> So you're a fucking ISD, and the only education system that can save your life? Fuck you."
8227,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't think he would support that, it just seems unwise to let him stay."
8228,<|emo_disgust|> That would leave us with less than - $4.3 billion in obligations this year
8231,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, the horror."
8232,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst I've ever seen. The double fist bump is the most awkward thing I've ever seen an INTJ do.
8233,<|emo_disgust|> We lost our best forward when [NAME] left and [NAME] is our worst wing...bless us
8234,<|emo_disgust|> This is the dumbest thing I've ever read on the sub.
8235,"<|emo_disgust|> This is how you lose a war. Get out, bully. "
8237,<|emo_disgust|> This is the dumbest thing I've seen on here today. You are so deep in denial.
8238,"<|emo_disgust|> She's a pro-Assad piece of shit, and I hate that."
8239,<|emo_disgust|> You are so perfect
8240,<|emo_disgust|> He always looks like he’s about to say something rude
8242,"<|emo_disgust|> It's not always as simple as ""calling a friend and telling them you have no further use to them."""
8243,<|emo_disgust|> A month is wayyyyy too long. I would really like to buy this and be on my way straight away
8244,<|emo_disgust|> Well damn. Good to know my instincts were right.
8245,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is having a career year that’s all. Good for him.
8246,<|emo_disgust|> They were so angry! Damn what a violent outfit!
8247,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that’s a good list
8248,<|emo_disgust|> He would say “it’s my job” and then complain before the meeting. It’s just not a tone.
8249,"<|emo_disgust|> I was so scared I went into the toy store and cried, they are great for teaching but you need money too"
8250,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so envious of this gorgeous girl
8251,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is probably working with dealerships
8253,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I'm so tired of this argument because the majority of us are not in that camp.
8254,<|emo_disgust|> The fuck? What's the cringe?
8256,"<|emo_disgust|> But there is so much hate, I don't see it...I see hope..."
8257,<|emo_disgust|> I can't see [NAME] throwing a pick in Fuckin Minnesota
8258,<|emo_disgust|> When my son told me he wanted to be a paralegal...
8259,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, he did."
8260,<|emo_disgust|> People on reddit are assholes.
8261,<|emo_disgust|> This is how a grown up looks at this type of shit
8262,<|emo_disgust|> That’s so disgusting. It’s like if a hungry octopus ate your shoes
8263,<|emo_disgust|> How fucking dare you!
8264,<|emo_disgust|> A-fucking-men!
8265,<|emo_disgust|> A few weeks ago I hated him so much... I now hate him so much...
8266,"<|emo_disgust|> I really wish that there was a tool to allow you to control your speaker, especially if it's a subwoofer or speakerphone jack. You may go jack crazy if you're not careful!"
8267,<|emo_disgust|> Weird flex since he is 6 foot so it's not an issue.
8268,<|emo_disgust|> I don't really care about the team. Is it bad? Absolutely. But if it's good for anything it will only be in spite of this poor season.
8269,<|emo_disgust|> Worst case scenario you have a guy who goes out at night and indecentlyresses girls.
8270,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm not saying any of this is horrible, I'm saying there isn't any need for you to act shocked and upset over it either."
8271,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, so disgusting. "
8272,<|emo_disgust|> How the hell is that not ticketable. It was blatant lane rage. How is that not reckless?
8273,"<|emo_disgust|> People here are very complicated, and it's nice that we have a subreddit for that."
8274,"<|emo_disgust|> That guy is so attractive, let alone inked in blood 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
8276,<|emo_disgust|> The one who wrote this on a post I had upvotes. He is either very stupid or just completely blind to the fact that upvotes mean nothing in this world.
8277,<|emo_disgust|> He is definitely the most Lookin' hot dude I've ever seen.
8278,<|emo_disgust|> Why the fuck do you even care about being a woman?
8280,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird that I love your username.
8281,<|emo_disgust|> So you're a horrible person. Congratulations.
8282,"<|emo_disgust|> I just got banned for ""ignorance or gross misbehavior"" after I admitted my guilt, I'm a shitty person."
8283,"<|emo_disgust|> If he doesn’t like it, tell him he’s a bad hire."
8284,<|emo_disgust|> That sucks. Sorry for your loss. We’re here to listen and be there for you.
8285,<|emo_disgust|> Well this was frustrating.
8286,<|emo_disgust|> Well people need to stop excusing bad behavior
8287,<|emo_disgust|> No no no. This is bad. No one will be able to believe that this guy actually thought of that
8288,<|emo_disgust|> The first is worse :(
8289,<|emo_disgust|> Who gave you a order? How do you know we're not the only ones who hate that.
8290,<|emo_disgust|> Your parents are assholes.
8291,"<|emo_disgust|> There is a weird new twist on the old ""twist the phone company"" joke, makes me think it was written by a 4 year old."
8292,<|emo_disgust|> I am not a [NAME] fan so I hate the Allianz deal for him but I still support [NAME].
8293,<|emo_disgust|> Omg I love you hahahahahgaha
8295,"<|emo_disgust|> Just a dude talking shit to a girl, what's your beef?"
8296,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I'm glad she is okay.
8297,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is getting age 30 and already has been guilty of 6 felonies he could just walk out of prison and never be in trouble again
8298,<|emo_disgust|> This was disgusting. VWP
8299,<|emo_disgust|> This person is so disgusting.
8300,"<|emo_disgust|> No, you have a special relationship with the dead."
8302,<|emo_disgust|> Youre a terrible person.
8303,<|emo_disgust|> She might actually find it funny if I said it was from [NAME].
8304,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] would hate her...
8305,<|emo_disgust|> It’s an extremely dangerous thing to do. One young couple in particular was recent immigrants from Syria. They were very bent on carrying out an attack.
8306,<|emo_disgust|> The amount of fake news out there is absolutely astounding.
8307,<|emo_disgust|> In that case...honey the fuck offs
8309,<|emo_disgust|> You have to agree with [NAME] that the media are a hated group. That's why you're trying to shame people with facts and logic.
8310,<|emo_disgust|> i feel really envious
8311,<|emo_disgust|> Holy fucking shit
8312,<|emo_disgust|> Weird that there's more [NAME] here than the game this sub hates.
8314,<|emo_disgust|> When it's an insult.
8315,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, you’re horrible"
8319,"<|emo_disgust|> We fucked in the ass, you dumbass."
8320,"<|emo_disgust|> A couple of times the guy just walked right up to me and stuck his face in my ear. ""You dirty dog."""
8321,<|emo_disgust|> It's so damn creepy.
8322,"<|emo_disgust|> This is like the ""I have no idea"" post of the week."
8323,"<|emo_disgust|> There, that made sense but idk what to do with it now. Edit: forgot to put ‘schoolgirl’ in."
8324,<|emo_disgust|> No. Not funny enough for that.
8326,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah it is pretty low effort actually. Like a beer commercial.
8327,<|emo_disgust|> Wow! I’m so sorry! 😂
8329,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like he was a little bit mean and rude to me at times
8330,"<|emo_disgust|> >It's weird, I hate myself for even thinking that"
8331,<|emo_disgust|> That’s more disgusting than a church farting in the woods.
8333,<|emo_disgust|> And I thought it had to do with the fact that he's single/aged 25-27
8334,<|emo_disgust|> I think it's just a big ass barf bag full of shit.
8335,"<|emo_disgust|> Those are thick arm groins, suggest they’re from somewhere badminton."
8336,<|emo_disgust|> He said something racist. He's president now. This is just a petty squish on his discontent.
8337,<|emo_disgust|> The most disgusting phone call I've ever received.
8338,<|emo_disgust|> This is incredibly creepy and weird. Good riddance to awful rubbish.
8339,<|emo_disgust|> Just go home already. There is no point thinking about it
8340,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I'm glad that you made it out alright.
8341,<|emo_disgust|> You do? Yeah. That guy is a fucking monster.
8343,<|emo_disgust|> i start feeling slightly mad
8344,"<|emo_disgust|> You have no clue what fascism is, it's the worst."
8345,<|emo_disgust|> Damn how I hate [NAME]
8346,"<|emo_disgust|> Not gonna lie. It was weird because, while I enjoyed the game, I was actually a little confused by the whole situation at times. "
8347,"<|emo_disgust|> This is like the third repost from the same troll, they're just so stupid."
8348,<|emo_disgust|> She just needs to stop talking about herself.
8349,"<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting. No one should act this way to you. If someone does, it’s disgusting.."
8350,<|emo_disgust|> Oh you mean the one in your post history? It's a fucking Shame subreddit
8351,<|emo_disgust|> That and [NAME] hasn’t given off any signs as far as I know. I‹m shocked.
8352,"<|emo_disgust|> They’re a couple gone in a matter of hours, you’re a monster!"
8353,<|emo_disgust|> Now I am really angry.
8354,"<|emo_disgust|> A year ago, I wondered if this was a thing but it's seemed more like a thing lately. "
8355,<|emo_disgust|> So that’s what it is :D
8356,<|emo_disgust|> But he is! And he’s going to need it badly to win in Iowa.
8357,"<|emo_disgust|> If you're upset about it, your upset isn't being heard. Sad."
8359,<|emo_disgust|> She is a disgusting human being
8360,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that she took up driving lessons in order to get license plates seems even more concerning. She should probably get some counseling but that's way outside her comfort zone.
8361,<|emo_disgust|> Well this is frustrating and I'm sorry your boyfriends GF discovered this. The way your girlfriend talked to you was creepy.
8362,<|emo_disgust|> If the ad is negative you can be assured the reader will only use it if he thinks it's negative.
8363,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh my gosh! This is horrible news for you! What a nightmare. Hope you can move past it someday, okay? ""You'll never move past it"" sounds like a lot. "
8365,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is the worst [NAME]. I hope he succeeds here. Good riddance to terrible seasons, sorry. "
8367,"<|emo_disgust|> So sorry your parents didn’t have the foresight to make the same move, buddy. You could have gotten $100k before you blew your retirement."
8368,<|emo_disgust|> I don't like [NAME] but I wouldn't describe his game as bad. Probably average from what I've seen from him.
8369,<|emo_disgust|> I never heard this before and I'm fucking appalled
8370,"<|emo_disgust|> That shit really just reminded me what a productive idiot [NAME] is, and I'm glad he's not the owner of the Jets"
8371,<|emo_disgust|> I agree. The way reddit is currently set up is not very user friendly.
8372,<|emo_disgust|> The fact it's being compared to a porn star makes it even worse.
8373,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing out of all of these is being an introvert. I'm lucky I have great friends.
8374,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I don't suck a car!"""
8375,<|emo_disgust|> The best case is a creepy shoplifter. The worst case is a disturbed college student.
8378,<|emo_disgust|> She should tell the story of the night she went missing
8380,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, that last one was a bullshit call."
8381,<|emo_disgust|> This is my favorite one yet. Why?
8382,<|emo_disgust|> That's not even how most states Constituteate rape. Most states are pretty toothless as fuck when it comes to rape laws though.
8385,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is working with dealerships. Scams that prey on vulnerable individuals.
8386,<|emo_disgust|> Wow. Wasn’t even expecting that.
8387,<|emo_disgust|> There is no going back or anything. Please understand. We all do what we have to do to be happy. My advice would be to stay positive and focus on the bigger picture.
8388,<|emo_disgust|> He was going to rape a 10 year old girl. You're just a kid.
8391,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck the nuts
8392,<|emo_disgust|> What a weird way to find out. You should definitely check out some of the tour stops instead of giving a totally generic answer like [NAME]
8393,<|emo_disgust|> I am so disappointed [NAME] made it into smash
8394,<|emo_disgust|> Just like I don't like him. But I can't just leave him.
8396,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't care how intelligent you are, you can do much worse than what the state has?"
8397,<|emo_disgust|> How dare a porn star call his pornStar hot!!!
8398,<|emo_disgust|> I hate when that happens...
8400,<|emo_disgust|> Your comments on a video you didn’t personally watch disgust me
8401,<|emo_disgust|> The fact he's posting them is incredibly telling.
8402,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] why? I feel absolutely useless as a mom.
8403,<|emo_disgust|> The problem is not the game. the problem is the league.
8406,<|emo_disgust|> I feel you. I hate the way I look at myself.
8409,<|emo_disgust|> >How dare [NAME] get any press Lol this fucken idiot.
8411,<|emo_disgust|> That's so disgusting. You can't even look at that.
8412,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, I wanted to read this... damn it"
8413,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that you think that is a bad idea is insane.
8414,<|emo_disgust|> I want to tell you that I really hate how much I love it. That’s because I really hate myself.
8415,"<|emo_disgust|> I get these all the time. ""I have no one to blame but myself for all the bad things I've done"" is pretty cringe."
8416,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I’d feel more uncomfortable playing as a woman than playing as a male.
8417,<|emo_disgust|> It’s creepy
8418,<|emo_disgust|> She is a hypocrite in what she is doing.
8420,<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting. He should be embarrassed. VWP
8421,<|emo_disgust|> What in the actual fuck. Why are we even here thinking about this kind of shit?!
8422,<|emo_disgust|> I love him. He really is a great example for what NOT to do when it comes to Twitter.
8424,<|emo_disgust|> Worst! This is worse! I love this! Take your upvote! Thanks.
8425,"<|emo_disgust|> Ouch, that hurt, gross!"
8428,<|emo_disgust|> Your a horrible person.
8429,<|emo_disgust|> What a dumb idea.
8430,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst power play I have ever seen. It really is
8431,<|emo_disgust|> Because its awful.
8433,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] i'm sorry, I really am."
8435,<|emo_disgust|> Don't do that to yourself.
8436,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] i hate him
8437,<|emo_disgust|> Weird way to spell penis.
8439,"<|emo_disgust|> That’s horrible. I don’t know if you’re completely right, but that is disgusting."
8440,<|emo_disgust|> I hate this man
8442,<|emo_disgust|> Who gives a shit. Stay in your fucking car.
8443,<|emo_disgust|> How would he like it if I told him I like him
8444,<|emo_disgust|> She's a horrible owner but like her website she's also a horrible politician...vote for both!
8445,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I’m leaving reddit. No one here cares about the cringe.
8446,<|emo_disgust|> People think I hate them but I actually really love them.
8447,<|emo_disgust|> The main reason I stopped playing was because I got tired of constantly getting hit while defending myself.
8448,<|emo_disgust|> But its ugly.
8449,"<|emo_disgust|> I’m with you, nagies are awful. You make them look like adorable Doofus puppies. :("
8450,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, this person's opinion is stupid."
8451,<|emo_disgust|> That dude at the finish line was SO Close to being drunk. I would literally vomit if I were him.
8452,<|emo_disgust|> They’re fucking disgusting
8454,<|emo_disgust|> This is awful.. I'm sorry for your loss.
8455,<|emo_disgust|> We're just gonna have to kill [NAME] and [NAME] and everything else we can find
8458,<|emo_disgust|> I am very sorry that you are experiencing this. Please know that you are loved and hear that your loved ones are safe.
8461,<|emo_disgust|> This is a beautiful poem that is extremely uplifting and moving. RIP.
8463,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird because sometimes I think we just kind of get it and other times it seems worse and I know others hate it because they get it.
8464,<|emo_disgust|> >You're ugly
8465,<|emo_disgust|> Those are the WORST TUTTS I have had e-mailed or IMEDUCED me in school
8467,<|emo_disgust|> This is the weirdest thing i've ever seen on reddit.
8468,"<|emo_disgust|> I fucking hate [NAME] and I fucking love [NAME] just so they can both whine about how they wanna ""fix"" [NAME]."
8469,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn I wanna see the new art
8471,<|emo_disgust|> I feel bad for the teacher who has to go back to class tomorrow because he or she is mad. I wish them the best.
8472,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Bite me, stupid"""
8473,"<|emo_disgust|> You're in for a surprise when all you hear is hateful, racist and sexist comments. Get out now."
8474,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling slightly insulted that some other redditors have used this word in the same sentence
8476,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I'm hungry now.
8477,<|emo_disgust|> My mom is a mental health issues worker. She told me last week that it's extremely hard for workers to get mental health help. It's especially hard for women.
8478,<|emo_disgust|> We can't be a country anymore till [NAME] makes us like animal feeds.
8479,<|emo_disgust|> She'll get more and more desperate until she kills [NAME] with a car.
8480,<|emo_disgust|> That’s one of the reasons I hated humanity. Because these people could’t make a rational decision.
8481,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] [NAME] damn it
8483,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is terrible...he really really really is...
8484,<|emo_disgust|> I hate that I like them...
8485,<|emo_disgust|> That's beyond fucking creepy!
8486,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow thanks for sharing, that is good stuff. How many people do you have?"
8487,<|emo_disgust|> My life was complete
8488,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is real life. People are always saying stuff like that when we're friends.
8489,<|emo_disgust|> He’s not cute like that.
8490,<|emo_disgust|> > Is there anything about this that could be considered child rape? This video is a prime example of a worst case of child rape.
8491,"<|emo_disgust|> Why do all these terrible, terrible things have to be a thing? Because life is short and we’re short, goddamnit."
8492,"<|emo_disgust|> What a load of old shite, isn't it?"
8493,<|emo_disgust|> Soooooony VUgh she's horrible
8494,<|emo_disgust|> You've been warned.
8495,<|emo_disgust|> We have an enemy inside of us and its something we either fight or ignore.
8496,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, we need some way to get past these guys. My [NAME] is the only one I can stand against these current gen enemys."
8497,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so disgusted and mad by the whole thing
8499,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating. I feel you.
8500,"<|emo_disgust|> And he also said: ""I'll be honest, I'm not a huge fan of both the parties."""
8501,<|emo_disgust|> No one likes being the butt of jokes or being insulted.
8502,<|emo_disgust|> This really is disgusting.
8503,"<|emo_disgust|> If you're asking why you're not being asked to join that group, you sound like a rather hateful and ignorant person, kiddo. "
8504,"<|emo_disgust|> He got separated from his mother months ago, i think shesight is around age 50"
8505,"<|emo_disgust|> ""All the jobs are safe because the [RELIGION] [RELIGION] countries are terrible"" is pretty lame."
8506,"<|emo_disgust|> But it's actually worse! When your neighbors have pets, there is no need to get neighbors involved!"
8507,<|emo_disgust|> A girl who was caught on camera fondling a chicken leg. Wow that’s disgusting
8508,<|emo_disgust|> This is worse than a horror movie because the monster is real
8509,"<|emo_disgust|> I’m sick of this shit, but what’s the point of a Reddit account? What’s the point?"
8510,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so damn bothered and distressed and angry
8513,<|emo_disgust|> It's the worst when it's something you've been complaining about
8514,"<|emo_disgust|> Omg, i can’t believe this is where we’re headed lol"
8515,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that’s one way to get rid of them
8516,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn... How do we know that’s a real post? I've seen this before and wondered the same thing
8517,"<|emo_disgust|> My god, [NAME]! He does amazing impersonations. What a pain in the ass, too."
8518,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn [NAME] lets his body separate while this is going on
8519,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like hes being a little bitchy at times with me
8520,<|emo_disgust|> It would be weird seeing him on the floor while playing but he can play point guard like [NAME]
8522,<|emo_disgust|> That'll be $100 for a haircut with no eyebrows? Sounds like a pretty shitty deal
8523,<|emo_disgust|> The fact he is white is the real weirdness.
8524,<|emo_disgust|> A fuck ton of people know about this but I’m not one
8525,<|emo_disgust|> We’re the bad ones [NAME] can’t turn around on
8526,<|emo_disgust|> That's disgusting. I'm hoping she never Does Exactly Exactly What You Say...
8527,<|emo_disgust|> The irony of it all being posted just days before gun control in the wake of the tragedy in Colorado
8528,<|emo_disgust|> It's a horrible argument in every single respect.
8529,<|emo_disgust|> The way i feel about it i'd be more than happy to fight [NAME].
8531,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not crying..... you're crying!
8532,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you describe a body part as disgusting. Part of being disgusting is disfiguring someone's body parts.
8533,<|emo_disgust|> How did you lose 15 pounds in 8 months of healthy eating?
8535,<|emo_disgust|> That was the worst power play I’ve ever seen
8536,<|emo_disgust|> i cant help but feel extremely angry and frustrated
8537,<|emo_disgust|> This really is scary.
8538,<|emo_disgust|> People have weird sex lives.
8539,<|emo_disgust|> Damn you are full of shit.
8540,"<|emo_disgust|> I guess, the media loves to play up these sorts of stories."
8541,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I want to see a fully growngrown adult [NAME] play the lead inX-Men Origins: Wolverine!
8542,"<|emo_disgust|> What, you're not impressed with someone if they don't agree with you?"
8543,<|emo_disgust|> My mom used to always put milk in our trash. It was awful. Now my trash is clean.
8544,"<|emo_disgust|> > but it sucks, there's no other option. No I don't!"
8545,<|emo_disgust|> The guy's face is permanently scarred
8547,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] and her crew are truly the worst
8549,<|emo_disgust|> She looked fucking sick
8550,<|emo_disgust|> I'm honestly stumped as to why the fuck they use 16:9 aspect ratio with monitor resolution.
8551,"<|emo_disgust|> No idea what their problem is but fuck off, how about you try to solve your problem instead of complaining about it!"
8554,<|emo_disgust|> When someone asks me if I'm a girl I say no. Why? Because I hate it.
8556,<|emo_disgust|> Wow the kids at the grocery store are really bad at names!
8560,<|emo_disgust|> So... she’s a pro-Assad piece of shit.
8561,"<|emo_disgust|> No I have anxiety and they work, I am a horrible person and it sucks but i have it so i can go without for a while"
8562,<|emo_disgust|> Well I hope so and that’s the worst thing I can think of to say lol. The guilt is eating away at my spirit
8564,<|emo_disgust|> Wow!!!
8566,<|emo_disgust|> Why would anyone stop to think of the irony that you're talking about a person who is literally two feet away from putting their hand on a gun's trigger
8568,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking harrasing
8569,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird.
8570,"<|emo_disgust|> She is an awful judge and prosecutor. Look at [NAME] admitting she is awful, awful. "
8572,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.
8573,<|emo_disgust|> She was in a hurry and carelessly pushed her head into the window... Ouch!
8574,<|emo_disgust|> This is incredibly creepy.
8575,"<|emo_disgust|> The sad thing is, almost everything that comes out of her mouth is positive. She always seems to say negative things too!"
8576,<|emo_disgust|> This is literally the worst thing I've ever read on this sub. Take my Upvote.
8577,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a bit odd. He loves to celebrate goals scored from the penalty spot.
8578,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck man I love watching him.
8579,<|emo_disgust|> You are wrong though. I am a 26 year old married father. I can remember the first time my wife had a serious relationship and it was a messy one.
8581,<|emo_disgust|> The only bad thing I seen of that video was the music.
8582,<|emo_disgust|> i am here to tell you that it i am here to tell you why im feeling so frustrated and angry
8583,<|emo_disgust|> You dirty scavenger
8585,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking and being a boy
8586,<|emo_disgust|> This is the kind of thing people say to get theirured.
8587,"<|emo_disgust|> > This guy's obsession with some old, familiarised and perhaps even somewhat creepy idea of masculinity. Looks like he thinks porn is some thing you could only do with a penis."
8589,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn I need to find a similar use for these 😢
8590,<|emo_disgust|> This is a good one. What a horrible one.
8592,"<|emo_disgust|> You have to admit, [NAME] was a pretty pleasant surprise."
8594,"<|emo_disgust|> I'll eat the rest of them, it's not like we have any energy. "
8595,<|emo_disgust|> I am so angry.
8596,<|emo_disgust|> You are disgusting.fic
8597,<|emo_disgust|> But my life is complete
8598,<|emo_disgust|> They’re horrible people.
8599,<|emo_disgust|> It's a very fake news article - made up by Never Truthian.
8601,"<|emo_disgust|> It was a fucking joke [NAME]. Nowhere in that comment did I mention ""cuckolding"" and yes I do want kids."
8602,<|emo_disgust|> > There was a major security guard who was beaten so badly that he was permanently disfigured. RIP
8603,<|emo_disgust|> She literally has a dead goat on her head
8604,<|emo_disgust|> Not really cringe. Just sad. What the hell
8605,<|emo_disgust|> Weird how they make people comment *hugs*.
8607,"<|emo_disgust|> The fake news media is all over this story. Even Motherboard has said it's ""ridiculous"""
8608,<|emo_disgust|> When it's that bad you should go back to your country.
8609,<|emo_disgust|> Not your problem [NAME]!
8610,<|emo_disgust|> Informed that a person had used social media to identify and harass them... Wow.
8611,<|emo_disgust|> Because they're scared people will find out
8612,<|emo_disgust|> It's actually worse than I thought it would be. For a few months now I've been extremely worried that I'm going to end up like this
8614,"<|emo_disgust|> Don't I just love the “sadbhbhbhags”? That's the main India problem, why are they complaining?"
8615,"<|emo_disgust|> No, not to mention the way [NAME] treated her."
8616,<|emo_disgust|> He is the absolute worst
8617,<|emo_disgust|> They're all ugly and creepy
8618,<|emo_disgust|> i feel extremely frustrated right now
8619,<|emo_disgust|> I love you for making this
8621,<|emo_disgust|> Damn i should try that 😂
8622,<|emo_disgust|> This is horrible... I just can’t imagine.
8623,<|emo_disgust|> That seems stupid. How did you get that far?
8624,<|emo_disgust|> What a useless tool!
8625,<|emo_disgust|> There are some bad apples in this family.
8627,<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting.... People like that should be outed.
8628,"<|emo_disgust|> My husband has never had a single episode of depression, nor does he ever have an episode of anxiety. We are completely in love"
8629,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is awful at his job
8630,<|emo_disgust|> That’s creepy.
8631,<|emo_disgust|> i have this sudden rush of guilt when i think of what people must be going through in these difficult times
8632,<|emo_disgust|> And her ex looks horrible!
8633,<|emo_disgust|> Your ass after I beat you up for using a hammer?
8634,"<|emo_disgust|> ""This thing is so dumb"""
8635,<|emo_disgust|> I think it's ridiculous that they have to swear on the bible for special abilities as [NAME] already has one
8636,<|emo_disgust|> It's the worst when we don't win that game :(
8638,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, that would put me about.2 more than [NAME]. This is not a good argument."
8640,<|emo_disgust|> This is creepy and weird
8641,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] what a stoner
8643,<|emo_disgust|> Those are the worst jerseys I've ever seen.
8644,<|emo_disgust|> Oh fuck off. I've seen that shit a lot.
8645,"<|emo_disgust|> Well just because I hate it doesn't mean I have any argument, OP."
8646,"<|emo_disgust|> A few: ""IT'S MY FAVORITE NAMES"" / ""IT'S MY FAVORITE NAMES"""
8647,<|emo_disgust|> She looks like [NAME] to me. Couldn't even do a real makeup job.
8648,<|emo_disgust|> What? We need some more evidence than this. Thank you for taking the time to elaborate on your stupid argument.
8649,"<|emo_disgust|> I've already tried it, I'm just worried it'll kill me... "
8650,<|emo_disgust|> i can also tell that she isn t feeling very stressed
8651,<|emo_disgust|> This is so disgusting.
8652,<|emo_disgust|> This is almost irritating. I hope they fix it.
8653,<|emo_disgust|> That's my fault for eating the wrong stuff haha. I'm sorry for that.
8654,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, are you on bit.ly?"
8655,"<|emo_disgust|> How? They would just refuse to accept anything outside of their accepted view, which is: all people are created equal androgynous. "
8656,<|emo_disgust|> You’re ugly
8657,"<|emo_disgust|> We can't have nice things, [NAME]!"
8658,<|emo_disgust|> That's not even creepy. The hair is still there for the world to see.
8661,<|emo_disgust|> This comment is so stupid.
8663,<|emo_disgust|> But I'm a vegan and it's disgusting that I can't even eat pork because I'm aveg!
8664,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that's blacked out on the iPhone 5s. The colors on the 5s are great though.
8665,<|emo_disgust|> This comment is complete garbage.
8666,<|emo_disgust|> Soooo [NAME] is super upset.
8667,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that’s the only football he’s ever thrown to a receiver.
8668,"<|emo_disgust|> If you don't like your friends over social things, guess what, shut up about it. "
8670,<|emo_disgust|> Because it was illegal to film a police encounter in the city.
8671,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damnit
8673,"<|emo_disgust|> My mom loves mayo because of those weird Unsalted Veal pops that come with it, but I’m a vegan."
8675,<|emo_disgust|> And it’s even worse honestly
8676,<|emo_disgust|> This is actually hilarious how you can get downvoted for sharing that information
8677,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow they're back to the old pattern of all the awful things, one lousy actor, and a terrible direction. Very disappointing."
8678,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't know the word, but I can give you plenty of examples of how it's abused. It's basically called ‘kineticlighting’ "
8679,<|emo_disgust|> Lol no way those things are vegan! You can't eat any of them raw!
8680,"<|emo_disgust|> How is this not hate speech? That son of a bitch! I call him a racist, sexist, homophobe."
8681,<|emo_disgust|> Omg yes! Please share this!
8682,<|emo_disgust|> Man I'm jealous of [NAME]
8683,<|emo_disgust|> Not the right sub. I'm just mad at the tone in this post.
8684,<|emo_disgust|> You mean [NAME] isn’t doing it...
8685,<|emo_disgust|> i feel rather petty and annoying sometimes
8686,"<|emo_disgust|> I just want people to stop saying ""I don't like [NAME]. WHY ARE YOU SO GOOD at this?"""
8687,<|emo_disgust|> It's literally disgusting.
8690,<|emo_disgust|> Wow what a nightmare.
8691,<|emo_disgust|> This is actually one of the worst I've seen...
8692,<|emo_disgust|> We have also had a few people tell us they've never seen the movie. That's gotta be a big problem for them.
8693,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit these refs actually fucking hate us.
8694,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, he didn't and he still doesn't. "
8695,<|emo_disgust|> You said you wanted to give it a new life... now what?
8696,"<|emo_disgust|> ""You don't need to know [RELIGION] to be an angry [RELIGION]. You already know it's a violent religion, stop trying to pretend otherwise."""
8698,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] that's awful. I didn't see anything about substance abuse onscreen.
8699,<|emo_disgust|> i don t feel like im being hated or being hated by them i feel like theyre loving me and using me like a meat to feed their beast
8700,<|emo_disgust|> This is just pathetic. You don't really have much else to say because you believe all this. Go write a blog post on how happy you are.
8701,<|emo_disgust|> The fact you're making ancillary jokes at this hour is pretty telling.
8703,<|emo_disgust|> In case he’s considering running for president: Stop being disgusting. Stop using old and disgusting language.
8704,<|emo_disgust|> Shut up.
8705,<|emo_disgust|> The whole post reeks of troll.
8706,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], what? Fuck off."
8708,<|emo_disgust|> It could be worse! All the chairs and table are still upright and table top might fall off &screw up!
8709,"<|emo_disgust|> In that case, what the hell is going on at Amazon?"
8710,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a miserable buffoon.
8712,<|emo_disgust|> That [NAME] was awful tonight
8713,"<|emo_disgust|> She took the fucking kids, huh?"
8714,<|emo_disgust|> I feel attacked
8715,<|emo_disgust|> The lack of any decent amount of content does this game really suffer.
8716,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, it can get really bad with high temperatures. It's worse when you have kids with the car :D"
8717,<|emo_disgust|> Worst that can possibly happen
8718,<|emo_disgust|> He’s an arsehole and can’t be bothered with women even when they’re with him OMG.
8719,<|emo_disgust|> You would think so since all you're doing is asking stupid questions...
8720,<|emo_disgust|> This is just another reason why we should phase him out as soon as possible. Not least because it's absolutely disgusting
8721,<|emo_disgust|> The [NAME] of horror!
8722,<|emo_disgust|> Those bastards lied to get him to take a test. He couldn’t refuse it.
8723,"<|emo_disgust|> Damnit, we need a ""Fuck the cow"" meme now!"
8724,<|emo_disgust|> It's the worst when it doesn't work though. A lot of the time it just shows up as an overreaction.
8725,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, she looks like [NAME] to me. Kind of round face, deep blue eyes. "
8726,"<|emo_disgust|> And those are just the individual ones! Those aren’t even the guilty guys, there’s a lot of people involved!"
8727,<|emo_disgust|> That’s so frustrating
8728,<|emo_disgust|> The worst of the bunch
8730,<|emo_disgust|> i always feel suspicious after all that i do
8731,<|emo_disgust|> But it's the scariest thing he says.
8732,<|emo_disgust|> In that time I killed myself over five times. I need help
8733,<|emo_disgust|> And I'm not alone. We can only hope that the message gets out of here before it's too late.
8734,<|emo_disgust|> Oh the irony.
8735,"<|emo_disgust|> Just go home already. Some people are obnoxious and obnoxious, but they're not obnoxious and obnoxious people."
8736,<|emo_disgust|> She'd do this to me. What a weirdo.
8737,<|emo_disgust|> Oh fuck off.
8740,<|emo_disgust|> It was absolutely disgusting.
8741,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, that video really does show that [NAME] are a hate sub."
8742,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck that guy.
8743,<|emo_disgust|> That’s scary
8744,<|emo_disgust|> He is also an awful vegan.
8745,"<|emo_disgust|> They were talking about her shoes. Not the actual picture, mind you. But they had a good laugh over it."
8746,<|emo_disgust|> It’s hard to look at. The way they have sex is just gross
8748,<|emo_disgust|> When have I ever said one bad thing about a US president? Ever?!
8749,<|emo_disgust|> He's not. He's just bad at hiding his true colors.
8750,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, she probably doesn't mind that much. "
8751,<|emo_disgust|> i will feel like a neglectful mother and even worse
8752,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst I've ever seen. One second I was OMG this was horrible... then OMG this was horrible...
8753,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that’s a lot of chonkers. I’m so sorry for the loss of your friend.
8754,<|emo_disgust|> i cant see the harm in the situation but i feel that there has been a case where the driver has not given consent which is not the law here if they didnt realize there was a potential danger to others
8755,<|emo_disgust|> I thought he was being sarcastic
8756,<|emo_disgust|> The amount of time you spend on Reddit is insane.
8758,<|emo_disgust|> That [NAME] pass was worse than [NAME] any year.
8759,<|emo_disgust|> So rude and so insane. I'm so sorry you had to experience like that. I hope you can move past it!
8760,<|emo_disgust|> This team has no fucking clue what to do against the Hawks
8761,<|emo_disgust|> If she's married she isn't going to want to divorce [NAME].
8763,"<|emo_disgust|> She just can't seem to get it through her head. She'll continue to scream at you, yell about how you're an idiot, and blame your drinking."
8765,<|emo_disgust|> There is a difference between being too disgusted to even be disgusted by something and being disgusted at what is disgusting.
8766,"<|emo_disgust|> Not only are these assholes, but they're devious little liars."
8767,"<|emo_disgust|> People saying their politics is all over the place is the problem, not the left."
8768,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn it [NAME].
8769,<|emo_disgust|> Why wouldn't you just fuck off and stop trying to be something you're not?
8771,<|emo_disgust|> That dude looks just as uncomfortable in red and blue as he does in grey.
8773,<|emo_disgust|> That’s absolutely disgusting. Where the state even comes in? What a complete and utter failure of the planning department.
8774,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch. Scary stuff.
8775,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling a little stressed out and frustrated with the situation because everyone is so much more than and the time we are spending together just doesn t seem to amount to anything
8776,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn it, where have you been that you're ignorant?"
8778,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, I hate to be the bearer of bad news but...it is!"
8779,"<|emo_disgust|> That was so stupid, and so disgusting 🤣"
8780,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] wasnt as bad in SF, but lately it's getting to be like this [NAME]."
8782,<|emo_disgust|> People should never say that about a grown man
8783,<|emo_disgust|> Those women who claim to be against abortion because their fetuses come with such features are crazy.
8784,<|emo_disgust|> Sooooo yeah I'll never have a relationship and then all of a sudden that crush kicks me right back into it and its been like a week
8785,<|emo_disgust|> It’s actually strange. Sometimes I really feel for them. It’s like I care.
8791,<|emo_disgust|> It’s the worst when the person doing the worse is an actual atheist themselves
8792,<|emo_disgust|> This is what I was thinking! Lol
8793,<|emo_disgust|> Well fuck a couple more tries before you're downvoted.
8794,<|emo_disgust|> It makes me really upset when people say generic shit that's just completely false. Fuck off with your generic shit.
8795,<|emo_disgust|> You have no clue what fascism is. We know what it is and it's awful.
8796,"<|emo_disgust|> The worst has happened. I’m so sorry that you had that experience. It’s not normal to think that way. Good on you for moving on, though. "
8797,<|emo_disgust|> I love Dlo lol
8799,<|emo_disgust|> Because our democracy is not going to be held hostage by terrorists
8800,<|emo_disgust|> Because other people's opinions are factually wrong.
8801,<|emo_disgust|> What's your relationship with [NAME]? /s
8802,"<|emo_disgust|> When I took the exam for my license, the examiners said I needed to study medicine. I needed a better reason to study medicine."
8803,"<|emo_disgust|> What? No deal, abort, abort!"
8804,<|emo_disgust|> I didn’t find it that bad but I’m definitely wondering why the title of the video was “schoolgirl weird”
8805,<|emo_disgust|> They’re gross
8806,<|emo_disgust|> That's why I hate Twitter.
8807,<|emo_disgust|> The best defense is a good offense. We don't know what our offense is yet. That is the problem for us.
8808,"<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck? A few months ago, I would have loved that. Now, I hate it. "
8809,<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry to hear that. I hope she can avoid it in the future.
8810,<|emo_disgust|> Just make sure it ends well for him
8811,<|emo_disgust|> A FUCK NO NO FUCK
8812,<|emo_disgust|> A girl who smells like garbage shouldnt be dating someone with such disgusting standards.
8813,<|emo_disgust|> This is just so creepy.
8814,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah it sort of sucks now.
8816,<|emo_disgust|> This is how our country treated the [NAME] during the [NAME] era. Brutal.
8817,"<|emo_disgust|> No, [NAME] is a terrific offensive player but no one fault him for notching 40 points on the road in the regular season"
8818,"<|emo_disgust|> It is odd how easily manipulated some people are. Those with emotional issues need help, not angry at the person who shows love."
8820,<|emo_disgust|> That is sick...
8821,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] just needs to be stopped. This is ridiculous. A missed field goal would have given us the advantage
8822,"<|emo_disgust|> No I just had a serious argument with my boss. He was loud and obnoxious, extremely irate about a situation, and totally didn't like the way I handled it. "
8823,"<|emo_disgust|> This is exactly what I said. Sad, but true. Thanks for sharing."
8825,<|emo_disgust|> Omg yes lol
8826,<|emo_disgust|> That is so disgusting. face
8828,"<|emo_disgust|> There is another video that accuses you of being a [NAME], so I will assume it is fake"
8831,<|emo_disgust|> They're looking at the wrong bar to judge their worth.
8833,"<|emo_disgust|> I would hate to see an [NAME] repeat as president, but honestly? No."
8834,"<|emo_disgust|> That's awful, good to know that your boyfriend is okay."
8835,<|emo_disgust|> She can even do this at work lol. A lot of people I know have had this happen to them. I hate it.
8836,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a very angry old man. He's also very good at what he does. What he does is good but it's definitely questionable.
8838,<|emo_disgust|> The only bad thing about this is that it wasn’t posted on reddit
8839,<|emo_disgust|> Who the fuck leaves a hot iron on the couch
8841,<|emo_disgust|> You have been repeatedly warned. They are not listening. Stop pointing fingers.
8842,<|emo_disgust|> Oh man that's the worst. He’s got to be a pro hockey player who is terrible in college.
8843,"<|emo_disgust|> I actually really like it, it seems like it'll be a great addition to the team. "
8844,"<|emo_disgust|> He would never murder her for saying that, even if he really liked her."
8845,<|emo_disgust|> Just because you are against all of them does not mean that you are a racist. racists are racists because that's the only correct way to think.
8846,<|emo_disgust|> Because they're ashamed.
8847,"<|emo_disgust|> That’s not a fucking card, [NAME]!"
8848,<|emo_disgust|> It's a weird thing to complain about. People seem to hate it.
8849,"<|emo_disgust|> I mean honestly, the guy that answered the door for you was probably the worst person that had ever lived in an apartment."
8850,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] looks like he's about to have a barf party with everyone.
8851,<|emo_disgust|> She is horrible at her job
8852,<|emo_disgust|> I'm also offended the movie is called Kill Me Do Notyrin
8853,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is an asshole even when he's not ""on his shit"""
8854,<|emo_disgust|> This is a hot pic Shame she'll kill us all
8855,<|emo_disgust|> What a disgusting way to think about the natural world!/s
8856,"<|emo_disgust|> When you hate something, you tell a story about how it's worse than your actual experiences."
8857,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking bollocking reply. I’ll let the facts speak for themselves then.
8859,<|emo_disgust|> i had been feeling really cranky and grumpy today
8860,"<|emo_disgust|> I don't know the guy, but I *aggressively* call him out for being a ""worm"" on the internet."
8861,<|emo_disgust|> He looks like a troubled child
8862,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is “cis people don’t want to be called trans or genderqueer because they’re just guys.” 🤣
8863,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn you, I didn’t know this stuff existed! I’m super impressed!"
8864,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is what doomed our football team to this. Sorry, [NAME] is the only other name I can think of."
8865,<|emo_disgust|> In some cities the law says that you have to pay at the point of delivery if you haven't been vaccinated and they do that.
8866,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is waiting around in long lines in a busy intersection all the while talking like a complete idiot
8867,<|emo_disgust|> You are so disgusting. All you can think is to make more and more disgusting.
8870,<|emo_disgust|> I think you are too stupid to believe your own Twitter feed 🤔
8872,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I want to. Damn I want to.
8873,"<|emo_disgust|> >""I feel so virtuous for having an upvote count of just 5"" Damn it, that's good. I think what he was trying to say is this is what the Reddit culture is like today"
8874,"<|emo_disgust|> They're just waiting till they see a big fat fat dinky cat with a bad case of the giggles and then go all ""Why the fuuuhhh?"""
8876,<|emo_disgust|> The guy in the white lab coat looks like he got dicked by a bat
8879,<|emo_disgust|> Shut up [NAME].
8880,<|emo_disgust|> She’s 30...has never fucked a man. Get over it
8881,<|emo_disgust|> It's pretty fucking creepy.
8886,"<|emo_disgust|> Omg, her eyebrows. Holy motherfucking eyebrows."
8887,"<|emo_disgust|> Whoops, I should have said: “[NAME]” Oh, sorry."
8888,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch! That hurt my gGarF
8889,"<|emo_disgust|> Nooooooo, nooooooo..."
8890,"<|emo_disgust|> I’m so sorry your friend did this to you. You’re not wrong to feel this way, it’s normal, it’s human and I’m so sorry you have to deal with it"
8891,<|emo_disgust|> You know what? He does this all the time. Just go somewhere else and have sex WITH whoever pops up first. 
8893,<|emo_disgust|> How dare [NAME] disrespect [NAME]. I'd pay real money just to have him removed from my team.
8895,"<|emo_disgust|> It's more of a case of ""oh yeah"" then ""i like."" Sometimes ""no."""
8896,<|emo_disgust|> I would give a fucking blow job right now.
8897,<|emo_disgust|> It's not hard for those of us who have lived through multiple shocks to self-esteem. It also doesn't help much to have a sympathetic family circle or any kind of network to lean on that will listen to you
8898,<|emo_disgust|> Oh no! Poor guy!
8899,<|emo_disgust|> i feel a little bitchy about it
8900,<|emo_disgust|> If you use it then this is a no-no.
8901,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is worse btw
8902,<|emo_disgust|> Not saying you're wrong. Just saying those posts were hateful
8903,<|emo_disgust|> That whole side note is a little weird.
8904,<|emo_disgust|> The weird stuff. A little bit scary.
8909,<|emo_disgust|> Oh look a fat 15 year old.
8910,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you doubt [NAME]
8911,<|emo_disgust|> Now I'm crying before work thanks a lot. 🤢 
8912,<|emo_disgust|> Man I was so sad when they turned the third period off. Wasn’t really expecting it
8913,<|emo_disgust|> This is the absolute worst
8914,<|emo_disgust|> Damn.. I wanted to watch this with my 2Dong Bar.
8915,<|emo_disgust|> People have come from all over the place and all walks of life to this sub just to have their say. Some are awful!
8918,<|emo_disgust|> Those assholes from the Reddit mod team? They're assholes for posting that shit.
8919,<|emo_disgust|> This just seems to remind me of some of the worst moments from Street Fighter.
8920,<|emo_disgust|> So much frustration.
8921,<|emo_disgust|> He was also charged with armed robbery.
8922,<|emo_disgust|> The dude is a loner. I never saw him around with kids.
8923,"<|emo_disgust|> We got you, now go kill [NAME]"
8924,"<|emo_disgust|> This is creepy and weird and yes, yes it is fine. I was under a lot of stress that day and it helped!! Thanks (!!)"
8925,"<|emo_disgust|> There's no excuse for racist trolling, period."
8926,<|emo_disgust|> If the top line shows the difference it's because the Sabres are spending much of that on forwards.
8927,<|emo_disgust|> > > What a pathetic argument. Stop using words like that to describe yourself.
8928,<|emo_disgust|> i was feeling pretty grouchy over the holidays but now im feeling the cold worse
8929,"<|emo_disgust|> Just leave the door, dude. Not worth it."
8930,<|emo_disgust|> Well this makes me feel worse.
8934,<|emo_disgust|> This is actually somewhat horrifying. I wish I had the right words.
8936,<|emo_disgust|> Omg stop spamming [NAME]
8937,<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell paid to watch the crap they just saw.
8939,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was also known for repeatedly throwing objects at security
8941,<|emo_disgust|> Thats what I have said many times. Its ridiculous and hurting my self esteem.
8942,<|emo_disgust|> You could be wrong about that too... but that's another story
8943,<|emo_disgust|> This is one of those rare times when I really do enjoy talking to random strangers on the internet.
8944,<|emo_disgust|> That’s worse tbh
8945,"<|emo_disgust|> I had a friend send me a picture of the old [NAME] hat they used to wear when they were alive, I can’t remember what it was made of or which kind of handle it was from but it was way off the mark"
8946,<|emo_disgust|> What a weird way to find out
8947,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, I've always been attracted to guys that other girls call ""bitches."" So even though it's a bit creepy, its not weird and just ""bitches"" are just called ""bitches."""
8948,"<|emo_disgust|> In your opinion, why are furries so weird?"
8949,<|emo_disgust|> No it was just bad faith and it’s disgusting. He needed to apologize.
8950,<|emo_disgust|> Those are the only two adult words she's using.
8951,"<|emo_disgust|> What a rude, drunk girl. "
8952,<|emo_disgust|> What a nasty goal
8953,<|emo_disgust|> It's been done to me so many times now it's routine. Tell your mates that.
8954,<|emo_disgust|> What really? I thought he hated America
8955,<|emo_disgust|> But it looks so pretty!
8957,<|emo_disgust|> She has a very interesting and conflicted view on the matter but she clearly has not thought through all the issues properly.
8958,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has a very obvious dislike for windmills and forests Edit: also, [NAME] is a forests freak"
8959,<|emo_disgust|> I know it's been a couple years but I still hate text speak.
8961,<|emo_disgust|> He can’t defend himself can’t justify his actions...
8963,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, I wanna see some videos of this dude going after deer, while wearing full gear!"
8964,<|emo_disgust|> Lol just stop.
8965,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, there's a good chance your parents are drug dealers."
8966,"<|emo_disgust|> Not even an exchange, that looks like an obvious troll."
8968,<|emo_disgust|> This is the best thing I've seen today.
8969,<|emo_disgust|> > And then you were a horrible person. Really a horrible person. And then you turned around and said *fuck it*
8970,<|emo_disgust|> She's literally making 20/burdensome
8971,"<|emo_disgust|> This is the kind of offensiveness that made me leave the church, and that caused me to eventually change denominations and become an atheist. You've completely missed my point."
8973,<|emo_disgust|> So you defend your use of N-word?
8974,<|emo_disgust|> This is creepy and weird at the same time. Great work!!
8975,<|emo_disgust|> That must smell awful.
8977,<|emo_disgust|> This is truly disgusting. This is the kind of thinking that led to the rise of ISIS
8978,"<|emo_disgust|> I love when we let [NAME] go, but it’s hard to do now. "
8979,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] you are a horrible person.
8980,<|emo_disgust|> I just don’t like them 😑
8981,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] good god I hope there's a way to view crossposts or something? Or maybe you are just awful redditrific.
8982,"<|emo_disgust|> But still, no."
8983,<|emo_disgust|> I miss [NAME] and [NAME] so much
8984,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, when I get up around 5am and read your bullshit I just want to smother you"
8985,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird to think about saying [NAME] like that.
8986,<|emo_disgust|> Weird because our military usually wins. I don't know how this was resolved in real life.
8987,"<|emo_disgust|> A surprise, but a welcome one"
8988,<|emo_disgust|> I hate when I get jealous.
8990,<|emo_disgust|> The other day I got on and off two times in two minutes and didn't even give it a try. What a fail.
8991,<|emo_disgust|> How come it's so popular on here? I'd love to hear it if you could find any.
8992,<|emo_disgust|> I was going to say this but not in the same thread
8993,<|emo_disgust|> This thread is a good indicator that Reddit is becoming more and more awful
8994,<|emo_disgust|> Oh you mean they just don't know your real thoughts?
8995,<|emo_disgust|> >I can't believe [NAME] had to go through this...
8996,<|emo_disgust|> i feel that it isnt enough and more and more that im being rebellious against god and i have found myself supporting rebellious rebellious rebellious rebellious
8997,<|emo_disgust|> A fucken centaur
8998,<|emo_disgust|> So sorry! I hope things are better now for you than they were last year :(
8999,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] I hate them so much
9000,<|emo_disgust|> I have a girlfriend with whom I've had sexual activities. She's also the reason I'm now best friends with a guy who I had sex with before.
9001,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, more�AA!"
9002,<|emo_disgust|> That's too many pillows.
9003,<|emo_disgust|> I was wondering the same thing! I had to block the pics in case he posted them.
9004,"<|emo_disgust|> So, the news actually said that the manosphere hated him?"
9005,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is one of the worst pure goal scorers in NHL history...
9006,"<|emo_disgust|> This is not a ""we have a terrible example"" It's a ""we need to change how we think about rape and assault"" It's a "" WE need to accept rape is wrong because rape is wrong"""
9007,<|emo_disgust|> You'll be shocked to learn that Colorado has more Coloradansidiots than any other state...
9009,<|emo_disgust|> That is disgusting...and she had thewherewithal to put the foil on the front of the can...her eyes
9010,<|emo_disgust|> Why do people have that conversation in the first place?
9011,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird, I’m also on Reddit but I go to the gym and walk around at odd hours of the night all the time."
9012,<|emo_disgust|> i just feel like a stubborn ass drunk why the hell would you think youre smart
9013,"<|emo_disgust|> It sounds like she's blaming [NAME] for her own death, not her own personality..."
9014,<|emo_disgust|> The problem is the other players are all so stupid that I seriously doubt they even knew [NAME] existed.
9015,<|emo_disgust|> Who cares? I'm enjoying this 15 year old sh*t
9016,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird, don’t give it to him though, you’ll waste your money then :( prices are sky high"
9018,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing about this is how many of you had the temerity to link it to animal cruelty.
9019,<|emo_disgust|> Your dog is so fat!
9020,<|emo_disgust|> I'm in one. I started feeling the connection when I saw her picture at the start of this f
9021,<|emo_disgust|> So much false hope
9022,<|emo_disgust|> It's one more reason why I hate Reddit in general.
9024,<|emo_disgust|> Just saying. How infuriating. How wronged.
9026,<|emo_disgust|> I just don’t like [NAME]
9027,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] that's a really good pun
9028,"<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking idiotic idea, to blame all mental illnesses on all the drugs."
9029,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, your ass after the second?"""
9030,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] you are horrible. I hope your divorce is messy and her company doesn't use your company for stock options.
9032,"<|emo_disgust|> So, the left is now saying, in all seriousness, there was a big riot at the *Uprising* protests in Ferguson. "
9033,"<|emo_disgust|> >I was also disappointed to see that your ex didn't ask you out, you can't ask someone out after you've had sex with them."
9034,"<|emo_disgust|> Because people are very complicated human beings and are never going to understand a mistake just because someone put a ""backup plan"" on it"
9036,<|emo_disgust|> I would never even consider that. It's creepy and weird.
9037,"<|emo_disgust|> Lol I thought it was the 2ndhand worry that is making you think all this is from a ""less bad"" perspective. Sorry if I'm blowing your bubble. "
9038,"<|emo_disgust|> They played loud, sustained guitar on that song."
9041,<|emo_disgust|> The longer you look at it the more it looks like a stalker.
9042,<|emo_disgust|> Sooo inappropriate. Totally unprofessional.
9043,<|emo_disgust|> i mean it makes sense though since im a fan of some authors which are very clearly anti-nuclear at least in some cases but in others not so much and as it stands now i can feel a little dangerous
9045,<|emo_disgust|> How is that not child abuse? You're an awful human being.
9046,"<|emo_disgust|> No, he's a horrible, disgusting person. Please don't set him against you... "
9047,<|emo_disgust|> I can’t stand being clicked on. I really hate that.
9048,<|emo_disgust|> Holy shit...
9049,"<|emo_disgust|> I love taking my girlfriend to Victorias Secret, it's the best! She likes to be covered from head to toe inastic... "
9050,<|emo_disgust|> I just don’t love him.
9051,<|emo_disgust|> He just doesn’t like changing his phone number in case someone calls or texts.
9052,<|emo_disgust|> She sounds hideous
9053,<|emo_disgust|> Wow I don't even know that I'm supposed to cringe into stuff like this...
9054,"<|emo_disgust|> I mean.. if the head in the puddle says, ""I'm a frog"".. well then he's a frog."
9056,<|emo_disgust|> I think most people would agree that this is a terrible idea.
9057,"<|emo_disgust|> If the carpool part killed you, that is a hell of a pill."
9058,<|emo_disgust|> The comment thread is getting interesting.
9060,<|emo_disgust|> This is the first time I've ever seen him post that.
9062,<|emo_disgust|> What a selfish person he is
9063,<|emo_disgust|> Just because you are in talks with them doesn't mean you have an interest in marrying them. Just because a person doesn't want to settle down doesn't mean they'd be a good husband.
9066,"<|emo_disgust|> I have a 6 month old and he's still not understanding ""mao damn"" and how it is wrong."
9067,<|emo_disgust|> Oh my god that poor sap
9071,<|emo_disgust|> I’m so sorry. Is there other option that will get you out of your debt eventually or just get you out of debt at all? If you’re already in default why not?
9072,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I have an illness so please don't call or text me asking for medical help."""
9073,<|emo_disgust|> I feel more abused by this comment. My heart has broken for them.
9074,<|emo_disgust|> Your not a horrible mother. You have no idea what hard work and responsibility looks like.
9075,"<|emo_disgust|> My wife told me she hates me, but it's because I told her before. It will happen again."
9077,<|emo_disgust|> I will never stop loving you. <3
9078,<|emo_disgust|> You cant even imagine how bad the dasani was
9080,<|emo_disgust|> I don’t think he’s bad but this is the next level of bad.
9081,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing he did was lie about his taxes. Get out now
9082,<|emo_disgust|> I don't think he's racist. I think he's just ignorant.
9083,<|emo_disgust|> Now that that’s crazy
9085,<|emo_disgust|> That was the ugliest goal I've ever seen [NAME] celebrate.
9086,<|emo_disgust|> Man oh man.
9087,"<|emo_disgust|> The “manning issue” doesn’t centre around him, it concerns a lot of other Colts players not to mention [NAME] isn’t a pure blocker."
9088,<|emo_disgust|> That's my wife.
9089,<|emo_disgust|> She's probably cheating on you. Get angry and quit looking.
9091,<|emo_disgust|> It's more than a bit creepy.
9093,<|emo_disgust|> But that’s just gross and disgusting
9094,<|emo_disgust|> i want to be able to do that when i feel overwhelmed
9095,<|emo_disgust|> That's racist yikes.
9096,<|emo_disgust|> He is a moron for trusting him
9097,"<|emo_disgust|> It doesn’t matter how stupid you are, you’re still a grown man... Stop trying to pretend otherwise"
9098,<|emo_disgust|> But it’s just a picture...time to get the hell out and never look back!
9099,"<|emo_disgust|> You're a mean, ugly stoner."
9103,<|emo_disgust|> The most likely explanation is they got winded by some bad call.
9106,<|emo_disgust|> He looks like the jerk off version of [NAME]
9107,<|emo_disgust|> I thought I was the only one that hated her though tbh [NAME] definitely stands out.
9108,"<|emo_disgust|> That's odd. From our point of view, the only bad thing about [NAME] is that he's a traitor to thecause, which is even worse."
9109,<|emo_disgust|> She's an angry elf
9110,"<|emo_disgust|> No, I dont believe any of that is true."
9111,"<|emo_disgust|> This isn't a good post at all. If you really think that there were wrongfully imprisoned or otherwise unfortunate individuals, then you'd be very surprised to know how few of these things seemed to have an effect."
9112,"<|emo_disgust|> ""You dirty abo using a fucking mime type font"""
9113,<|emo_disgust|> > This is so infuriating.
9114,<|emo_disgust|> But why do I hate them so much? Why do I want them so bad?
9116,<|emo_disgust|> There are a lot of angry [NAME] fans out there.
9118,<|emo_disgust|> Those are some fucked up eyes
9119,"<|emo_disgust|> Your boyfriend lost it when you came home drunk, see him and act like nothing happened. This is life!"
9120,"<|emo_disgust|> The only thing we can agree on is that we need to start talking to each other and not about ""fighting words"" and ""morality""."
9122,"<|emo_disgust|> What, you don't understand the First and Fourth clause? You're literally a stupid person."
9124,"<|emo_disgust|> This is weird, isn't it?"
9125,<|emo_disgust|> I mean you can be weird but not weird enough to be creepy.
9126,<|emo_disgust|> i feel less rushed by my life
9127,<|emo_disgust|> Oh I was going to say no. I was honestly just frustrated at how easy it is to get banned >:(
9128,<|emo_disgust|> What the hell.
9129,"<|emo_disgust|> They've all fucked you, except [NAME] has fucked you a lot worse."
9130,<|emo_disgust|> I'm sorry for your loss. Stay strong and remember your sisters matter
9131,<|emo_disgust|> This is just bad. I love how much I agree with this post.
9132,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Fuck off, you're not going here"" is pretty much their policy."
9133,<|emo_disgust|> Oh that's disgusting
9135,<|emo_disgust|> I hate to say it but...KABOOOOO!
9136,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, [NAME] is giving us that vibe every week"
9138,<|emo_disgust|> You can’t be worse than [NAME] when you go against [NAME]. You’re the absolute worst
9139,<|emo_disgust|> Why did you post this?!?!?!???
9140,<|emo_disgust|> You can smell the bitter from his breath!
9141,"<|emo_disgust|> The fact that it exists is the real meat of this; the gaming industry being so obsessed with ""EA SPORTS"" and all its awful consequences "
9142,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird, I didnt know that the police had information about the identity of the people who made the complaint"
9143,"<|emo_disgust|> That hair looks awful; I don't even know if it's natural, or if it'srisborne or what."
9144,<|emo_disgust|> Oh you mean I already hate [NAME] but I'll still vote for her? Cool
9145,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing about this tbh btw. He’s an ex-friend. So I’m honestly shocked he didn’t say that if he did. Poor guy.’
9146,<|emo_disgust|> He's such a fucking bad actor
9147,<|emo_disgust|> What a douchebag!!/s
9148,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck her... I’m with you.
9149,<|emo_disgust|> Worst kept secret we knew about what happened to [NAME] wife
9150,<|emo_disgust|> Why is it that I love snow? It’s just about the only thing on Earth it Makes My Heart Burn
9151,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] what an awful dude
9152,<|emo_disgust|> I think I pissed my pants watching all these people swear.
9153,"<|emo_disgust|> That’s so sad. You can’t see his emotions. He’s one sad, angry cat."
9154,<|emo_disgust|> This thread is getting ridiculous
9155,<|emo_disgust|> In this day and age unless you are a die hard [NAME] or a loyalist you honestly have absolutely no idea what's going on.
9157,<|emo_disgust|> My biggest pet hate is when people combination multiple words in one sentence.
9158,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, you must've never been following the news at all. That is awful."
9161,<|emo_disgust|> Why the fuck do I have to explain how awesome [NAME] is 
9162,<|emo_disgust|> Your character's so sh*t.
9163,<|emo_disgust|> Those ears...those horrible ears
9165,<|emo_disgust|> If it wasnt for these other mods getting banned for doing good work this could have gone horribly awry.
9166,<|emo_disgust|> It is a cruel thing to say to someone with depression or anxiety. Especially to someone with a child involved.
9167,<|emo_disgust|> It's racist to call your black neighbors leeches.
9168,<|emo_disgust|> Holy mother of Invention!
9169,"<|emo_disgust|> Soooo [NAME] is a [NAME], [NAME] in disguise!"
9170,<|emo_disgust|> I really hate that I like some of them
9171,<|emo_disgust|> The fuck we doin’? Look how we're trying to tank...wtf
9172,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah I dont like when he talks shit about [NAME] all the time lol
9173,<|emo_disgust|> The fake news media is the actual worst.
9174,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] really should be thinking about this. What is his deal going to be for the next 4 years? And how much [NAME] sacrifice will he demand?
9175,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, and they're terrible at hiding it."
9177,<|emo_disgust|> That’s... pretty disturbing.
9178,<|emo_disgust|> You can't be worse than [NAME]
9179,<|emo_disgust|> It is an ugly duckling
9181,<|emo_disgust|> If this is a bad posting tell them sorry. This just wasn't funny.
9182,<|emo_disgust|> Those guys are worse than the [RELIGION] [RELIGION] [RELIGION] [RELIGION] [RELIGION] [RELIGION].
9183,<|emo_disgust|> This game is boring as hell lol kill me now
9184,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking cuck!
9185,"<|emo_disgust|> ""This guy got his ass kicked at the line"""
9186,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I hate [NAME]
9188,"<|emo_disgust|> This is such a terrible list. I'm heartbroken for the people who didn't manage to get their shit together, and I'm disgusted at how badly they did."
9189,<|emo_disgust|> You don't even know what you are talking about.
9190,<|emo_disgust|> The only [NAME] that has beaten [NAME] is [NAME]
9191,<|emo_disgust|> But I'm mad at the church for not believing in him more...
9192,<|emo_disgust|> There is something incredibly dangerous about this. Where were the parents? Where were the teens? Did they report him to the police if they knew him?
9193,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing worse than being in a porno movie is actually watching it.
9194,"<|emo_disgust|> Just to be clear, I had no idea he was going to say that."
9198,<|emo_disgust|> That damn cough
9199,"<|emo_disgust|> How come no one else posted anything complaining about all the ""waste"" at the dump?"
9200,<|emo_disgust|> This guy doesn’t know what karma is.
9201,<|emo_disgust|> I'm not sorry I have feelings too.
9202,<|emo_disgust|> It’s [NAME] time to show our gratitude
9205,<|emo_disgust|> She should get divorced then.
9206,"<|emo_disgust|> He’s a very public person, I’m afraid of him."
9207,<|emo_disgust|> Holy fuck that's bad
9209,<|emo_disgust|> I would say that in the video it's shaky and shaky fast
9210,<|emo_disgust|> No it’s the other way around. Your company sucks.
9212,<|emo_disgust|> This comment is one of worst I've seen
9213,"<|emo_disgust|> They're just so greedy, isn't it? They're literally swindlers!"
9214,<|emo_disgust|> She's a piece of shit.
9215,"<|emo_disgust|> Why should I feel sorry for you? I felt the same thing, it's hard to handle."
9216,<|emo_disgust|> What the actual hell was that
9217,"<|emo_disgust|> It's weird, because he looks normal, and then all of a sudden he looks gross"
9220,"<|emo_disgust|> How dare you care about your physical and mental health, you shitlord you! /s"
9221,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, he lost touch with reality a long time ago."
9222,<|emo_disgust|> If you don’t like it give it another five days or so..
9223,<|emo_disgust|> I don’t have anything to compare it to. I just have a weird idea of what I want out of a video. Good to know you’re not one of us.
9224,<|emo_disgust|> I can't believe she went to the gym.
9225,<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck is the Source dude talking about?
9226,"<|emo_disgust|> It's pretty cringe, I know I should be upset for the environment or something but I just want to watch gross ass movies like this"
9227,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, [NAME] really had no business running for president."
9228,<|emo_disgust|> The top comment is complete garbage.
9229,"<|emo_disgust|> What kind of response is that? A shitpost? Not that I'm offended by it, just that the level of comments on this sub are so low?"
9231,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting. It shows how little consideration some parents have for their own children.
9232,"<|emo_disgust|> He was a very ugly, disgusting man."
9234,"<|emo_disgust|> Lol I’d be weirded out if I’d to ask, but yeah it seems more likely as a manager than a born-and raised [NAME]. Lol"
9235,"<|emo_disgust|> That's the worst possible outcome for sure, that's just bad."
9236,<|emo_disgust|> He had too many guns
9237,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you let nature take its course. She must have known where you live.
9238,<|emo_disgust|> The real problem is making false rape accusations because they're easier to make. We should find a way to not let the shame creep into our decision making process.
9239,"<|emo_disgust|> Man I know we all like the LA Galaxy and all, but [NAME] sucks. "
9240,<|emo_disgust|> I don't drink or do drugs I just like sex
9241,<|emo_disgust|> He seems upset at how quickly he's making changes.
9242,<|emo_disgust|> So many women don't believe in themselves that they can't find the confidence to share it with the world.
9244,<|emo_disgust|> A complete ham sandwich.ain't no way this isn't sub spam
9246,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME], you're horrible"
9247,<|emo_disgust|> What a cruel man.
9248,<|emo_disgust|> No need to be hateful. I know you're a guy but I hate watching [NAME] and [NAME] play....
9249,"<|emo_disgust|> Your dog is eating spoiled, dirty food."
9250,<|emo_disgust|> i feel that the very mention of this title makes me want to pull my hair out
9251,"<|emo_disgust|> I've said it before, but if you had to pay anyone to be an ""outsider"" you're a stupid, lazy, materialistic, selfish, lazy, entitled, materialistic, selfish, materialistic, selfish animal. "
9252,<|emo_disgust|> It’s a weird way of saying you’re a fan of fascism
9253,<|emo_disgust|> This is so creepy and sad. Eleven??? A baby! I absolutely cannot imagine what that must feel like.
9254,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is hurting our defense
9255,<|emo_disgust|> Man I hate that [NAME] guy.
9256,<|emo_disgust|> You have no business running for public office.
9257,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I wanna watch that :(
9258,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] and [NAME] would both be awful on Sunday.
9259,<|emo_disgust|> They’re so angry
9261,<|emo_disgust|> I’m with you. It’s a horrible meme. Stop using it.
9262,<|emo_disgust|> It’s so incredibly condescending.
9263,<|emo_disgust|> A shitpost from the uncultured
9264,<|emo_disgust|> They were so distraught! I can see why they had their guns locked away.
9266,"<|emo_disgust|> That's just such a terrible take, as if being disgusted at something is anything but disgusting."
9267,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] what a fucking autist.
9268,<|emo_disgust|> This comment needs to be removed as it is hate laden.
9269,<|emo_disgust|> They look disgusting to me
9270,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is bad, period."
9271,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst I've ever seen. Take my upvote
9272,<|emo_disgust|> Not only does it makes me feel even more stupid but my legs look like Shrek Ghrok's!
9273,<|emo_disgust|> It's absolutely disgusting how much of the left has accepted this line of thinking.
9274,<|emo_disgust|> A couple of days ago I said I liked [NAME]. today I said [NAME] is terrible.
9275,<|emo_disgust|> That was a brutal goal.
9276,<|emo_disgust|> Damn you didn't hear me after I said I don't care what anyone says.
9277,<|emo_disgust|> I hope your life Stoop Kid is looking for you
9278,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, this needs some work. Thanks for the original version. "
9279,<|emo_disgust|> And how [NAME] was a terrible owner
9281,"<|emo_disgust|> And the saddest part is, all the people who hated him actually hated him because he was a rich politician."
9282,<|emo_disgust|> That would be a terrible idea
9283,<|emo_disgust|> She's hideous
9284,<|emo_disgust|> It's a test. Get angry then give her money.
9285,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, is it still illegal?"
9286,"<|emo_disgust|> ""That was a horrible pass if it was open"" - [NAME]"
9287,<|emo_disgust|> It's literally not. It's a very mixed bag for everyone. You should be able to tell by the tone of your posts which people are against it.
9288,<|emo_disgust|> The top picture is creepy.
9289,"<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting, there is no way to make it more disgusting."
9290,<|emo_disgust|> Who knew a dog could be so stupid. He's lucky to be around us.
9291,"<|emo_disgust|> If there's one thing the devs at id are known for, it's ignoring community wants and needs. "
9292,<|emo_disgust|> That's awful. I hope she can bounce back.
9293,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch. What a brutal take.
9294,"<|emo_disgust|> It was disgusting, but I wanted to watch a horror movie to get off my feelings"
9295,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is fucking destroy...
9296,<|emo_disgust|> Shut up 15 year-old
9297,<|emo_disgust|> So this guy is a little bit of a weirdo.
9299,<|emo_disgust|> Because we're a bunch of fucking scum who will tell the truth because a) they enjoy power and b) it's the most money they can make.
9300,<|emo_disgust|> He's right. The whole left arm thing is ridiculous.
9301,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damn what a comeback.
9302,<|emo_disgust|> i feel the need to tell you how i feel ugh
9303,<|emo_disgust|> Oh my [NAME] the people that made this [NAME] account are the absolute worst!
9305,<|emo_disgust|> If that's true it's disturbing that his campaign didn't spend a lot of time demonizing [NAME]
9307,<|emo_disgust|> That’s so creepy and weird. Good riddance to awful rubbish.
9308,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] damnit [NAME]
9310,"<|emo_disgust|> Lol I wish I knew what was in those limes, it’s a fucking loll "
9311,<|emo_disgust|> The worst case for this is they had 0 actual victims. No complainants at all.
9312,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is saying the same thing to both parents
9313,"<|emo_disgust|> Why can’t you just get out right? My life is like, 15 minutes by car at 3 am with no girlfriend."
9314,"<|emo_disgust|> No, that’s not what’s going on. This is a very common theme on /r/bengals rn. Everyone shames the Bengals for being bad."
9315,<|emo_disgust|> The only thing more pathetic than an entire family sitting in state to receive a generous holiday meal is a state government that provides generous holiday meals to all its citizens.
9316,<|emo_disgust|> FUCKKN!!!
9318,<|emo_disgust|> This is one of the worst I've seen.
9319,<|emo_disgust|> I'm just saying politics aside your username is a bit disgusting.
9321,<|emo_disgust|> Not happy
9322,<|emo_disgust|> Wow I’m so dumb
9323,<|emo_disgust|> You see he was a regular at a local bar and started getting weird comments until he came back to the attention of some cops
9324,<|emo_disgust|> Weird how he's the same guy who lied to Congress about why he lied to Congress when he said he had health care experience
9325,<|emo_disgust|> Well shit I hope he recover fast
9328,<|emo_disgust|> Omg that's too damn creepy
9329,"<|emo_disgust|> He could've just said, and you’d probably agree this guy was a tad underreacting. We’re all adults here, okay? "
9330,<|emo_disgust|> I hate that.
9332,<|emo_disgust|> It’s like it hates everyone. Except maybe fentanyl.
9333,"<|emo_disgust|> >it's the most awful combination of two words ""And I'm Happy Now!"""
9334,<|emo_disgust|> No need to shame yourself for not wanting an immediately popular woman.
9335,"<|emo_disgust|> I think he took a picture with a woman while it was still legal, you know, a photo that was still subject to photography laws in the 70s?"
9336,<|emo_disgust|> That seems stupid.
9337,<|emo_disgust|> This team needs a new intensity. Our defense has been bad for the past few seasons and the offense is playing at a monster level. We need to get physically results.
9338,"<|emo_disgust|> The first time I saw this, I was thinking ""fuck this dad"" and I didn't get it"
9339,"<|emo_disgust|> My wife is 40. I just can't in good conscience pick up a gun and kill someone because his wife says ""I want to!"" *exasperated, then crying*"
9340,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME], come on."
9345,"<|emo_disgust|> He is! How dare he refuse the honoured guests, he needs to be cheered up!"
9346,<|emo_disgust|> I never actually thought [NAME] was bad but I still hate him.
9347,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn I should have seen this coming. ""Why the fuck do you have a job anyway?"" Fuck off."
9349,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, you don't, because you have absolutely no self-control? "
9350,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh wow, there was a lot wrong with there, but definitely not much for me to write about. "
9352,<|emo_disgust|> The worst thing about the video is how much of the crowd seems to be extremely drunk.
9353,<|emo_disgust|> I'm gonna need to ask: where’d you get those ears??? You’re quite obviously pretty used to dealing with weirdos in your family.
9355,<|emo_disgust|> I just had a panic attack!
9356,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh no, they don't!"
9360,"<|emo_disgust|> This sounds a little paranoid btw. Do you have links to any leads, or anything confirm or deny this?"
9361,<|emo_disgust|> Because men still rape and be violent to women.
9362,<|emo_disgust|> I'd be creeped out. What is Reddit's relationship with the rest of the internet? Where do these norms come from?
9363,<|emo_disgust|> This is disgusting. This man should be outed to the world.
9364,<|emo_disgust|> It sounds like a lot of tinder shit.
9365,<|emo_disgust|> This hurts me.
9366,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a freak and I hate him.
9367,"<|emo_disgust|> I'm with you, pulju has been looking dangerous lately"
9368,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck how people are offended by a [NAME] shirt
9369,<|emo_disgust|> I'm sure more than a few of them will agree. It's disgusting.
9370,<|emo_disgust|> Yeah. It's so disgusting. I feel personally attacked.
9371,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a sad example of a coach and general manager... Jeter was awful last year but this is worse
9372,<|emo_disgust|> People like this are ruining Aus
9374,"<|emo_disgust|> The saddest thing I heard was ""I miss him in real life so would be okay with this"". "
9375,"<|emo_disgust|> And when she saw what he had done to people and thought that he was a monster, she was like ""get the hell out of here... before [NAME] gets any worse."" Wow, what a power trip. "
9376,"<|emo_disgust|> There is no way around it! If you have no life, you're just going to get worse and worse."
9377,<|emo_disgust|> What a stupid question. What would get them to say that?
9378,<|emo_disgust|> It looks like you were getting an obnoxious fart sound out while you were laughing.
9380,<|emo_disgust|> Well that was disgusting
9381,"<|emo_disgust|> Weird way to spell cowgirls, sorry for the confusion <3"
9382,<|emo_disgust|> Lol I wish I could call the cops. I really hate that they let him.
9383,<|emo_disgust|> So disgusting. Reminds me of olden times tbh with the salmonella.
9384,<|emo_disgust|> The real bad car is still ahead!
9385,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME]! I feel you, [NAME]!"
9386,"<|emo_disgust|> She is a disgusting, disgusting person."
9389,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is way behind schedule but I can feel him doing it (atleast from what I can tell right now). Feels we are the favorites
9390,<|emo_disgust|> There’s no need to be ugly
9391,<|emo_disgust|> What the fuck.
9392,<|emo_disgust|> Aghh...the environment in that photo is pretty bad.
9393,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a horrible dude.
9394,<|emo_disgust|> How disgusting. Any decent parent would tell him to tone it down. Stop making an adult out of a 3 year old.
9395,<|emo_disgust|> And so are you.
9396,<|emo_disgust|> Just go home already. Not going to listen to any of this bullshit.
9397,<|emo_disgust|> The worst kind of amphetamine. The kind that makes someone's skin crawl.
9399,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Ouuki no oshii kono sudou no kirei ni shugenjo"" / ""Ouuki no oshii kono sudou no kirei ni shugenjo"" Those are my favorite."
9400,"<|emo_disgust|> I do have bad days, I definitely have bad days. "
9401,<|emo_disgust|> This is so sad and so angry. Eleven year old me would beat this like a drum.
9402,<|emo_disgust|> She’s being ridiculous.
9403,<|emo_disgust|> I would definitely not recommend this to anyone under the age of 18. Definitely not safe. Just make sure you use common sense and stay on your parents' side.
9406,<|emo_disgust|> This has to be the most dangerous stunt I've seen someone do. One minor injury could end up ending someone's career.
9407,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, I would’ve done *even worse* had I heard that *second* hand*!"
9409,<|emo_disgust|> Don't be THAT guy
9410,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst thing I've ever read about [NAME]. Wtf?
9411,"<|emo_disgust|> No, it’s not... Please stop."
9412,<|emo_disgust|> Weird flex
9414,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] wasnt really an awful defender at this time.
9415,"<|emo_disgust|> It’s so disgusting. She had a right to have an opinion, it’s not hate speech. Get out now"
9416,<|emo_disgust|> You're too ugly to bully
9418,"<|emo_disgust|> That makes me think back to the very first issue of the Watchmen, when [NAME] himself was going through all of that emotional guilt and shame."
9419,<|emo_disgust|> >I know nothing and I don't care! What in the actual fuck??? How did I lose my job??
9421,<|emo_disgust|> Damn that's a yikes.
9422,<|emo_disgust|> And the 4th would be from the stomach so it would land on you and ruin the look
9423,<|emo_disgust|> I just don’t like how [NAME] looks across the top
9424,<|emo_disgust|> He does mention his anger issues and anxiety and everything else to me but it's hard to listen to those morons.
9425,<|emo_disgust|> I mean the actual video could be worse. It shows off some of the worst camerawork I've seen today
9426,"<|emo_disgust|> No, the only thing that is worse is running away from a sexual predator"
9427,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like this is a fake check but im not totally convinced
9428,<|emo_disgust|> The only guy who can be heard complain is [NAME]
9429,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is worse das auch der auch
9430,<|emo_disgust|> That damn wink slinging about being a working class fool. What kind of education did you get?
9431,<|emo_disgust|> The weirdest part is he doesn’t even seem to care. What a waste of tax dollars and time
9432,<|emo_disgust|> Oh wow I think you need a paid internship. Your skills are really not that great.
9433,<|emo_disgust|> Thats some weird way to spell [RELIGION].
9434,<|emo_disgust|> And yet here you are mad because of a meme
9436,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch! I felt the same!
9437,"<|emo_disgust|> The way it looks, it's pretty lewd. "
9438,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, [NAME]!"
9439,<|emo_disgust|> Oh [NAME] [NAME] that's horrible
9440,<|emo_disgust|> Who says we’re all virtuous. You’re a child. Stop playing stupid games.
9441,<|emo_disgust|> This is awful... please make this better... I’ve been through worse...
9442,"<|emo_disgust|> > I mean, it's awful and it is the only job I have. I hate working cleaning"
9443,<|emo_disgust|> That's a very creepy number.
9444,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is awful. I think I have written enough right now. He should get three years.
9445,<|emo_disgust|> Thats really creepy.
9446,<|emo_disgust|> Well that sucks... I'm going to have to get used to that... I'm not very good at names...
9448,<|emo_disgust|> He is the scum of the planet
9450,<|emo_disgust|> I know. I hate myself thinking such thoughts.
9451,<|emo_disgust|> Lol I just hate the use of the N-word.
9453,<|emo_disgust|> I fucking hate that I like them
9456,<|emo_disgust|> If it's that bad then I'm in for a rude awakening.
9457,<|emo_disgust|> Your comments are stupid and terrible. Shame on you.
9459,<|emo_disgust|> i just feel so selfish and so selfishly greedy
9460,<|emo_disgust|> Why yes it does. I just hate how awful it is to put them in the wrong sub.
9461,"<|emo_disgust|> People are dumb because they want to believe what they want to believe but when it comes to reality, they just can’t seem to believe it."
9463,<|emo_disgust|> A shitpost comparing [NAME] to [NAME]
9464,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn we need a ""Fuck it, we'll go with the pink instead of gold"" sign."
9466,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I’d love that.
9467,<|emo_disgust|> That was what I felt all along. It was just a terrible call. One of the worst I've ever heard
9469,<|emo_disgust|> I have a feeling they're all going to be apprehensive of doing anything that could get them in trouble.
9470,<|emo_disgust|> Weird.
9471,<|emo_disgust|> How awful.
9472,<|emo_disgust|> i feel completely disgusted and embarrassed by myself but the point i want to make is that you must not have asked my parents for help even if you may have been doubtful
9473,<|emo_disgust|> What a shame. I had a blast playing it...so much better now to avoid it
9474,<|emo_disgust|> My fucking head
9475,"<|emo_disgust|> It is. If it wasn't for him, I would be. He cares more about others than himself."
9476,<|emo_disgust|> What a garbage post omg
9477,<|emo_disgust|> Your dog is aggressive and has no socialization skills. Get him vaccinated and retested.
9478,<|emo_disgust|> The [NAME] is horrible. I just can’t believe he’s a general.
9479,<|emo_disgust|> Because if people knew that more people might commit crimes they'd feel less afraid
9481,<|emo_disgust|> That woman is the worst.
9483,<|emo_disgust|> I am sorry my fellow [NAME] are offended by your words.
9485,<|emo_disgust|> It's so ugly I can't even imagine it
9486,<|emo_disgust|> It’s all out of love. And I hate that I hate it so much
9487,<|emo_disgust|> Those babies are the worst. I feel for the two little girls who are the only thing keeping them from the dead end.
9488,"<|emo_disgust|> This is what I'm talking about, they just made a video about how they hate [NAME] and there seems to be zero mention of it and yet [NAME] has these positions?"
9489,<|emo_disgust|> I've thrown up.
9491,"<|emo_disgust|> The fact that a judge in Alabama has decided that the law is law rather than racist, is somehow worse than the act. "
9492,<|emo_disgust|> People here are very angry and upset at the whole situation.
9493,<|emo_disgust|> i could have just written this out for you but i feel offended because it could have been incredibly useful
9494,<|emo_disgust|> Sooo true. It's like a paranoid fever dream or paranoid memory.
9495,<|emo_disgust|> If a lot of your comments are downvoted then I don't know what to do. Have your flair removed from r/reactiongifs.
9497,"<|emo_disgust|> That shit really just reminded me of a watermark from an old video game, Manastee "
9498,<|emo_disgust|> The best thing about this: no one saw this
9499,<|emo_disgust|> I hate going out in treacherous weather. For real.
9502,<|emo_disgust|> She is trying to use the childrens service to get her political points across and is disgusting for doing so.
9503,<|emo_disgust|> That sounds awful. I'm so sorry.
9504,<|emo_disgust|> When it’s over I will be physically hurt
9505,"<|emo_disgust|> Man....I really hope they don't bring in a [NAME] for [NAME] joke, it would be awful."
9506,<|emo_disgust|> That's just...ugly.
9508,<|emo_disgust|> i feel so fucked up right now right fuckin
9509,"<|emo_disgust|> How dare you, she's your sister *indecisive voice*!"
9510,"<|emo_disgust|> A lot of young women are into this, but men need to get out there."
9512,"<|emo_disgust|> Why are you saying ""why are y'all shite""? We already know y'all shite."
9514,<|emo_disgust|> Why is this dumbass making racist comments to nonwhites?
9517,<|emo_disgust|> Well I'm not crying... you're crying!
9518,"<|emo_disgust|> When you don't understand or aren't passionate about something, it can backfire on you."
9519,"<|emo_disgust|> Not to say that you can't think for yourself on occasion. That being said, you need to always be careful to consider where your sympathies lie. "
9523,"<|emo_disgust|> She can take it up a notch, though. I still hate her and [NAME] anyway."
9524,<|emo_disgust|> It is incredibly rude.
9525,"<|emo_disgust|> And the weird, slightly hoarse voice he does."
9527,<|emo_disgust|> i was feeling a little stressed up
9528,<|emo_disgust|> But even worse: He hasn’t released any tax returns. Source: /r/incel and you’re still a idiot.
9529,<|emo_disgust|> I would throw a tantrum if I were him!
9531,<|emo_disgust|> It seems pretty obvious that you're a troll.
9532,<|emo_disgust|> What is dumb?
9534,<|emo_disgust|> Holy crap that poor sap
9535,<|emo_disgust|> I'd rather have [NAME] be a fucking idiot than deal with this
9538,<|emo_disgust|> He's got a fucking gun oh look another fucking thing
9539,<|emo_disgust|> Now this is some fucking bullshit
9540,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, it'd be awful if they kept pushing it."
9541,<|emo_disgust|> Awe! That sucks!
9542,<|emo_disgust|> That mother was probably on drugs or something... Oh [NAME] please no
9543,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck this passive aggressive shit.
9544,<|emo_disgust|> That's just sick!
9545,<|emo_disgust|> Not at all! She was distraught when informed that she had failed out. I've never heard her cry so hard.
9546,<|emo_disgust|> This is what I'm sick of hearing about here lately. People complaining about his performance but then acting surprised that he's worse than [NAME] when they both did really similar shit
9547,<|emo_disgust|> Wow I’ve sat like all of those
9548,"<|emo_disgust|> Holy crap I just got myias on the weekend, what is this doing here!?!"
9549,<|emo_disgust|> I find that hard to believe 😔
9550,<|emo_disgust|> Damn I wanna kill [NAME] now
9551,<|emo_disgust|> But the third picture is creepy.
9553,<|emo_disgust|> It's hard to have a normal life when people constantly remind you how great you are...
9554,"<|emo_disgust|> You're gonna leave this guy there, you cuck."
9555,<|emo_disgust|> This seems horribly optimistic.
9556,<|emo_disgust|> So dumb [NAME] can't pick his nose into someone's vomit 😂 I am so happy for a fellow [NAME].
9557,"<|emo_disgust|> So, the guy who broke into your house and assaulted you was off-duty police officer? The other cop did nothing."
9558,"<|emo_disgust|> That's a fucking shitty number to be calling parents about, especially since the one you are talking about is a shitty phone number which probably wouldn't be on their hands."
9559,<|emo_disgust|> That’s... Not veryiable.
9560,<|emo_disgust|> Don't ever stop breathing and wait for a miracle. Don't stop being happy you're depressed
9561,<|emo_disgust|> The weird thing is that the guy is a huge [RELIGION] supporter and is also the co-chair for [RELIGION].
9562,<|emo_disgust|> I feel I've gone mad
9563,<|emo_disgust|> The only reason I'm here is because I love reddit.
9564,<|emo_disgust|> They're bad because they don't pay any federal income tax. Which means the federal government pockets the difference between their pretax income and your pretax amount
9565,<|emo_disgust|> Now this is some serious BTHF. I know it’s hard to be a THO in thailand but this truly is.
9567,<|emo_disgust|> Well that can't be a good thing to say...
9568,<|emo_disgust|> This is extremely creepy given the way reddit treats its mods.
9570,<|emo_disgust|> Ouch! Your dog bit you on the butt!
9571,<|emo_disgust|> This looks like the work of a psychopath.
9572,<|emo_disgust|> He was a very bad defender as aob [NAME] had him playing against bad teams. So...
9573,"<|emo_disgust|> No, I would not. They say that a man could have a woman, but it would leave him feeling creepy."
9574,"<|emo_disgust|> I just got shut down by my insurance company due to claims overmy ex-girlfriend, which is why nothing has happened with us."
9576,<|emo_disgust|> i feel really selfish for saying this
9577,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you ask about [NAME]! /s
9582,"<|emo_disgust|> It’s a dumb and sexist thing to say, so yeah...fuck you for saying it."
9583,<|emo_disgust|> Damn those refs actually fucking hated us.
9584,<|emo_disgust|> i do feel jealous
9586,<|emo_disgust|> What is ironic about it
9587,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn it, karen"
9588,"<|emo_disgust|> Those refs just damn near whiffed on the first two drives, and [00:00] were giving [00:00]. "
9589,"<|emo_disgust|> Well, just a couple. But a lot of them are clearly extremely bad at their jobs."
9590,<|emo_disgust|> It's almost as if the people who actually use it are totally ignorant and doesn't help much!
9591,<|emo_disgust|> Just so ridiculous.
9592,<|emo_disgust|> The third picture is creepy honestly
9593,<|emo_disgust|> I'm honestly shocked I didn't check the weather before I posted this.
9596,<|emo_disgust|> i feel quite offended by the whole thing
9597,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is creepy
9598,<|emo_disgust|> No it was nothing. It was just bad luck. Sometimes you gotta be cruel.
9600,"<|emo_disgust|> No, it's not. It's perfectly legal. Some Alabama men just don't like them."
9602,"<|emo_disgust|> No, that’s not the only thing that fucked up her sense of self worth"
9603,<|emo_disgust|> What an ignorant yet powerful statement.
9605,<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell thought he was dead...he was so cool.
9606,<|emo_disgust|> That is weird especially since I have never heard of it being done before
9609,<|emo_disgust|> i am feeling very agitated i have come to your office
9611,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, you took the whole side photo with your phone Damn, you took the whole side photo with your phone"
9612,<|emo_disgust|> You can't see my flair
9616,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] just need to stop getting injured..
9617,<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell thought of that?
9618,<|emo_disgust|> i feel is unfortunate for the whole video and all of us filming as well
9619,<|emo_disgust|> You’re saying the police ignored the biggest Nightmare caught on video. Fuck off.
9620,<|emo_disgust|> The fact that the state is backing away from the promised affordable housing and instead promises neighborhood improvement is reason to question the state's promise and failure at affordable housing.
9621,<|emo_disgust|> Fucking hate [NAME] [NAME]..
9622,<|emo_disgust|> I want it so bad. I want to tear my eyes out.
9623,<|emo_disgust|> i feel like a violent little girl when i read your story and that s really awful
9624,"<|emo_disgust|> If he does win, he will need to become a shutdown QB like [NAME] [NAME] and [NAME] were, and that gives me worry for the future"
9625,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] sucks.
9627,<|emo_disgust|> It's pretty disgusting. Especially when you consider that many of these young men come from working- poor homes.
9628,"<|emo_disgust|> And the worst of all, he doesn't even do anything with it."
9629,"<|emo_disgust|> >I do hate that ""I do this because I like it]"""
9630,<|emo_disgust|> This is so incredibly creepy. What is wrong with people?
9631,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck her. Fzzzzzzzzzzzz
9632,<|emo_disgust|> I could cry at this
9633,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating and makes me want to die
9635,"<|emo_disgust|> That's the worst potential scenario for him if he plays like this for the rest of the season, he literally just can't shoot"
9637,<|emo_disgust|> This is the most brutal one I've seen
9638,<|emo_disgust|> Those were horribleucks.
9639,"<|emo_disgust|> In the summer, it was mostly through the roof. Not much worse now though."
9641,<|emo_disgust|> It wasnt even a *guestimating* of how shed voted...
9642,<|emo_disgust|> I hope you get fired for that. Shame on you
9643,<|emo_disgust|> i feel extremely guilty for having been a good girl the last time around
9644,"<|emo_disgust|> Not sure why the fuck these subs have gotten so popular. [NAME] is a huge bs presence on there, its just disgusting"
9645,"<|emo_disgust|> Those babies are deformed, ugly hags, and we're supposed to love them?"
9646,<|emo_disgust|> Wow!!
9647,<|emo_disgust|> Not true at all. You're just making things worse
9648,<|emo_disgust|> That last sentence pains me
9649,<|emo_disgust|> Don't fuck with us [NAME] fans
9651,<|emo_disgust|> The comments there are absolutely disgusting.
9652,<|emo_disgust|> They're all disgusting but [NAME] is the weird one that seems to me the most genuinely evil.
9653,<|emo_disgust|> I didn't believe that either until I saw the video.
9654,"<|emo_disgust|> Don't you know, [NAME] made over $24 million last year, he should get paid $5 million."
9656,<|emo_disgust|> He’s a horrible writer
9657,"<|emo_disgust|> Holy awful. The comment to ""watch the video"" was in poor taste."
9659,<|emo_disgust|> He’s just jealous of [NAME]...
9660,"<|emo_disgust|> I guess it kinda goes like this: a bunch of kids find out that they are getting a bunch of free food, and decide that they want to get those free food calories back"
9661,<|emo_disgust|> >he never cared about the poor.
9662,<|emo_disgust|> It's the same old excuse. [NAME] can't play because his foot is fucked...
9664,<|emo_disgust|> He is afraid of flying
9665,<|emo_disgust|> I'm going to have to agree with you. [NAME] is horrible when healthy but really terrible when he's injured.
9666,"<|emo_disgust|> It’s not a ""when"" it's a ""when did..."""
9667,<|emo_disgust|> This is the exact scenario I describe in my worst nightmare. I have been in Canada three years now and have never had this problem.
9668,<|emo_disgust|> You are pathetic for coming out as such such despite this.
9669,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is a piece of shit.
9671,"<|emo_disgust|> And if you're not happy with the answers you get, go out and find yourself a new one! "
9672,<|emo_disgust|> This is really creepy and weird. Good riddance to awful rubbish.
9673,<|emo_disgust|> Those people are so convinced they are perfectly fine to get irrationally angry.
9674,<|emo_disgust|> Oh yuck no. Can’t even try to blame [NAME] because this season is one they've been pretty successful at
9675,<|emo_disgust|> That is so sick!
9676,"<|emo_disgust|> I thought I read this as ""men don't get laid."" I'm so fucking wrong"
9677,<|emo_disgust|> It's weird because you do tend to notice that personality type more.
9678,"<|emo_disgust|> I always considered the idea of going in with ""you get better"" but then I realized how awful that'd actually sound."
9679,<|emo_disgust|> There's a lot of hate here...
9680,"<|emo_disgust|> It’s a terrible joke, and anyone who supports it is an idiot. Jokes like this are the worst."
9682,<|emo_disgust|> I'm so angry that you don't even have a story.
9683,"<|emo_disgust|> She didn’t rape him, he was her ""mentor"" until she started talking about herself and getting all weirded out."
9684,"<|emo_disgust|> That’s horrible advice. I should be freaking out, but this is just...okay???"
9686,<|emo_disgust|> That’s disgusting. You can do better.
9687,<|emo_disgust|> She said it was ok because the dog was behaviourally immature. What a rotten attitude in front of a young child.
9688,<|emo_disgust|> I’m going to be honest I hateastic about this game. I’m really not excited about it at all. 
9689,<|emo_disgust|> Because it would suck.
9690,"<|emo_disgust|> Holy fucking shit, did not see that coming, I knew I had watched something bad..."
9691,<|emo_disgust|> That’s disgusting. It’s beyond disgusting.
9693,<|emo_disgust|> She'll kill you but it looks more painful than a bee sting
9694,<|emo_disgust|> If all the [NAME] was to come back to the league wouldnt it be pretty?
9695,<|emo_disgust|> They’re weird people who think there’s a divine plan for all things
9696,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] looks so distracted. He must’nt even like hockey..
9698,<|emo_disgust|> No. This is creepy and weird. :(
9699,<|emo_disgust|> It’s what this sub wants and it’s disgusting to see.
9700,<|emo_disgust|> But what a fucking lous
9702,"<|emo_disgust|> ""I'll kill you if you do this again"" > why would you say that"
9703,<|emo_disgust|> It's so bonkers that every single fat [NAME] out there wants to be the next [NAME]...
9704,"<|emo_disgust|> Don't you dare try to pretend otherwise! You and your ""ideas"" are just as bad as bigots!"
9705,<|emo_disgust|> i dont even feel like i was wronged or somehow wronged
9706,<|emo_disgust|> Lol your mother does that all the time which is pretty gross I'm suprised her doesn't do a spit take tho
9707,<|emo_disgust|> The title is pretty lame tbh with all the swear words.
9708,<|emo_disgust|> I mean he is [NAME] but he's also a pretty fucking bad defender too
9709,<|emo_disgust|> This is so infuriating. I literally had to load this into YouTube.
9710,"<|emo_disgust|> And no, I don't believe him. I just found out he is a cancer to conservatives. 🤔"
9711,<|emo_disgust|> And look who just happens to be an ex-policeman!
9712,"<|emo_disgust|> They wanted to make a movie about [RELIGION], not about [RELIGION]."
9713,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], if you do that again I will report you to the police."
9714,<|emo_disgust|> I don’t know any but my own this makes me so uncomfortable.
9715,"<|emo_disgust|> Wow, that's even worse honestly"
9716,<|emo_disgust|> I am. Because my wife doesn’t even know “all the “what” in our family tree.
9717,"<|emo_disgust|> I think this is pretty great, I have a feeling [NAME] and [NAME] are going to have some issues in the off season after getting past [NAME]. And their 2 point shooting will be a problem for sure."
9718,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] has some pretty scary habits, that poor [NAME]."
9719,<|emo_disgust|> I’m a little of both. I have a soft spot for depressed people and I can get off on being rude to them when I really hate them.
9722,"<|emo_disgust|> If there is any justice in the world that will give us the ability to do this, I would be disgusted if they didn’t want us to."
9723,<|emo_disgust|> You're a disgusting abo
9724,<|emo_disgust|> If someone has 10k upvotes it means they're a Shill. FakeLies. You are stupid.
9725,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, I should be on board with #2, but seriously, wtf is that. "
9727,"<|emo_disgust|> Because as a black woman within the US, I was victimized at gun point by a white man."
9728,<|emo_disgust|> He was also sued by his ex for injuries she sustained in an argument over cigarettes.
9729,<|emo_disgust|> Just disgusting.
9730,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh yeah, y'all are horrible. We’re not saying for a second that you are any worse than everyone else here that’s a big possibility."
9731,<|emo_disgust|> But it's so damn beautiful
9732,"<|emo_disgust|> It just feels creepy, right?"
9734,<|emo_disgust|> There is a special place in hell for drivers like this 😢
9735,<|emo_disgust|> There's a fine line between friendship and hate; I'm not sure I crossed it.
9736,<|emo_disgust|> They’re both equally terrible so it’s not even a vote.
9737,<|emo_disgust|> That's so sick.
9740,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] was awful last night, hard to root for him"
9743,<|emo_disgust|> Well.. shit
9745,<|emo_disgust|> The guy who died also had a younger sister who was 5 months old when she died.
9746,"<|emo_disgust|> I want to be your friend. My crush started when I met you, but not anymore."
9747,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh, for fuck’s sake."
9748,"<|emo_disgust|> ""Saying yeezus' not wrong"" comes across as mean-spirited and condescending to the point of being racist. "
9749,<|emo_disgust|> Who made the xbox one?
9750,<|emo_disgust|> He’s [NAME]! And not the best choice for the job.
9751,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh no, that was the worst case!"
9752,<|emo_disgust|> Your age difference is incredibly creepy and creepy things like that still happen. No wonder you're single.
9753,<|emo_disgust|> He really seems to think all criticism is tantamount to hate.
9755,<|emo_disgust|> Who do you think is the most obnoxious in the rest room? (All unless stated is [ALBUM] or [NAME])
9757,<|emo_disgust|> That’s really unfortunate
9759,<|emo_disgust|> We don't want to take their best player. And they are pissed that [NAME] left.
9762,"<|emo_disgust|> Not every day, y'all! "
9763,<|emo_disgust|> Because it distracted from the regular season injury bug.
9764,<|emo_disgust|> It's the worst when they call [NAME] a bigot.
9765,"<|emo_disgust|> What country? I saw the video on Facebook, it was bad! Disgusting!!!"
9766,<|emo_disgust|> What a fucking pathetic article.
9767,<|emo_disgust|> Not to be rude but they did say they do enjoy their own kids... Can I have some of that now?
9769,<|emo_disgust|> My poor little pecker.
9774,<|emo_disgust|> You know he already said that to me. Why go there?
9776,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh my gosh, this entire post is insane. I think I'm in love"
9777,"<|emo_disgust|> He's handsome, let someone else choose how beautiful and well-endowed they are. "
9779,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] this is what I call a social construct. It's just another excuse for conservatives to be racist and sexist and homophobic.
9780,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] are a cancer in our society
9781,<|emo_disgust|> I honestly hated watching that scene live.
9782,"<|emo_disgust|> Damn, I want that pizza."
9785,"<|emo_disgust|> Man, this is the worst I've seen. I wish they were up by the net. "
9786,"<|emo_disgust|> In Canada where I live, it's common for smalltown women to not let their period come out until they're 40-45."
9787,<|emo_disgust|> He has a very bizarre understanding of how medicine works.
9788,<|emo_disgust|> Well that sucks... I'm sorry for your loss!
9789,"<|emo_disgust|> He still a ways off, but I’d take a shot....I really love him "
9790,<|emo_disgust|> This is almost word salad.
9791,<|emo_disgust|> This person is making me angry even though I disagree with most of her points.
9792,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is when you don’t care
9793,<|emo_disgust|> This is why I love reddit.
9794,<|emo_disgust|> It definitely has an air of hypocrisy with fascist Germany and the USA.
9795,"<|emo_disgust|> Just because you're ""af"" doesn't make you racist, bigot, sexist, or homophobe."
9797,"<|emo_disgust|> It's so weird that I didn't even get the ""richest"" place on earth in these pics, but not billionaire luxury hotel chains like Hilton. "
9798,<|emo_disgust|> > If someone hasn't ever even experienced a single remotely negative experience online from me then they *are* an asshole.
9799,<|emo_disgust|> That's some seriously rotten ethics on the part of that creep
9802,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is hurting us badly on special teams. If it wasn't for him, we WOULD be getting beat on the punt and kickoffs."
9803,<|emo_disgust|> i feel tortured like this
9804,<|emo_disgust|> The sad thing is you're right. There's an entire subreddit for men who want to date older women.
9805,"<|emo_disgust|> I have tried it with milk, it is just as bad."
9807,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], do you really think the media will let that go? I will vote for her if you don't. "
9808,<|emo_disgust|> My only issue is that they always seem to be a little bit over inspired.... Not enough.
9809,<|emo_disgust|> I thought you were the one that said 4:3 was the accepted picture format up until [NAME] took his ugly face and decided to go with 5:4.
9810,<|emo_disgust|> It’s a meme wtf
9811,"<|emo_disgust|> I’m a woman. I’m 45. I still want a man. Why should I get one until I have a stable, long term relationship?"
9812,"<|emo_disgust|> I mean you can feel bad for giving him one. I know he’s a terrible person, but you can do a lot worse than his current situation."
9813,"<|emo_disgust|> She isn’t your mom, and she’s a terrible, awful person."
9814,"<|emo_disgust|> We are in a weird moment, and we have a lot to look forward to in this economy. "
9815,<|emo_disgust|> That’s extremely creepy.
9818,<|emo_disgust|> He must hate the cooking community more than I do
9820,"<|emo_disgust|> [NAME], that fucking sucks. We still have [NAME] at least."
9821,<|emo_disgust|> My parents are crazy. I am not proud of them. I really wish they would open a restaurant.
9822,"<|emo_disgust|> Lol i hate it too! I've always got this weird energy without a pack when i's dead, this just feels like natural and normal."
9823,<|emo_disgust|> I just can't. I'm always full and I want to keep it up. Damn that's just...ghastly.
9824,<|emo_disgust|> Those mindsets are extremely dangerous to our democracy and human rights.
9825,<|emo_disgust|> No! Your a fucking creep! Shhh don't start t beating on her! She’s a lovely person! You’re a creepy person!
9826,<|emo_disgust|> Now this I'm gagging
9828,<|emo_disgust|> This is the worst thing I've ever read on Reddit.
9829,<|emo_disgust|> I mean a dude named [NAME] is really weird
9830,"<|emo_disgust|> It's even worse when they're talking about politics and economics, you fucking pouliot"
9831,<|emo_disgust|> How tf are you? This is so cringe.
9832,"<|emo_disgust|> She also said the couple were using it as a ""sting"" to get her attention."
9834,"<|emo_disgust|> And now that you're saying it, I'll assume you're a virgin. /s"
9835,<|emo_disgust|> When you think people are disgusting you think they're insane.
9836,<|emo_disgust|> Why are they angry?
9837,<|emo_disgust|> Not to mention [NAME] said he had a sore left hand the entire game
9838,<|emo_disgust|> That is what I told him... How dare you!
9839,"<|emo_disgust|> Lol, I see it now!"
9840,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is still possibility!
9841,"<|emo_disgust|> It's ok, thanks for taking the time and effort to post this. I'm not looking for support but it might be useful to someone who needs it."
9842,<|emo_disgust|> This joke is disgusting.
9844,<|emo_disgust|> It's like the worlds most infuriating reality show.
9845,<|emo_disgust|> The fuck is wrong with this drawing. This needs to be in a journal or something.
9846,<|emo_disgust|> i feel wronged and disturbed
9847,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh no, she is pregnant!"
9848,<|emo_disgust|> Those women are beyond disgusting.
9849,<|emo_disgust|> That’s disgusting...one of the worst things I’ve ever seen. A shame that politicians and media don’t seem to care enough to report it
9850,<|emo_disgust|> My bad. I thought it said 5 mins?
9851,<|emo_disgust|> Damn [NAME] let himself go
9852,<|emo_disgust|> >It's not [RELIGION] it's called child abuse. There you go anti-intellectual bullshit.
9853,<|emo_disgust|> i love shiawase and i feel tortured that she doesnt have her own series but it just could not work for her
9854,<|emo_disgust|> What a load of old shite. All that is left are acrimony and anger - a far cry from actual socialism!
9856,<|emo_disgust|> Man I hate those situations. You get stuck dealing with the guilt and shame for a day or two then it ends.
9857,<|emo_disgust|> Who the hell thinks he has a fucking plan.
9858,<|emo_disgust|> Fuck [NAME] for continuing to give her a platform despite this video.
9859,<|emo_disgust|> My feelings are hurt.
9860,<|emo_disgust|> It's so creepy how much I like this.
9861,<|emo_disgust|> And you're not a horrible person because you took a stand against what he believes in... you took a stand against what [NAME] believe in!
9862,<|emo_disgust|> I know this sounds crazy but I never felt this way before.
9863,"<|emo_disgust|> Yeah, people who say no rape is ever wrong and it's only happened to them."
9864,<|emo_disgust|> They don’t understand my hate for [NAME]
9865,"<|emo_disgust|> Oh look, it's Shrek 2: http!"
9868,<|emo_disgust|> This thread is a good indication that Reddit hates conservatives.
9871,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you interrupt the circle jerk this is so infuriating. I have my reasons for wanting to watch but this is just a cheap shot.
9872,<|emo_disgust|> It's so disgusting that someone who has said similar things to me has to be a liberal.
9873,<|emo_disgust|> And they look so damn good in makeup.
9874,<|emo_disgust|> The worst is watching from the comfort of my own home
9875,"<|emo_disgust|> And what a rotten year for the Jets. Worst QB in the league, worst WR bust, worst general manager."
9877,<|emo_disgust|> That was worse than a movie jump scare
9878,<|emo_disgust|> That'd be an awful lot worse than ending up in a dumpster.
9879,<|emo_disgust|> That's a disgusting amount of sesame oil.
9880,<|emo_disgust|> >a rotten rotten apple That's a quote from the article. What a rotten apple
9882,<|emo_disgust|> [NAME] is disgusting how dare he call out the refs for not calling the game-tying kick
9883,<|emo_disgust|> If that's the case then I'm appalled.
9884,<|emo_disgust|> How dare you! We have laws against this! Stop using your false and baseless statistics!
9885,<|emo_disgust|> The real worst are the people who call themselves vegan yet follow a paleo diet.
9886,<|emo_disgust|> Lol I don't play sports but I fucking love college football and that sounds yiffey
9887,<|emo_disgust|> This is a good post and I agree. I’m just really pissed off that I was pressured to like it.
9888,<|emo_disgust|> Those are worse than the [NAME] ones [NAME]
9889,<|emo_disgust|> What a bummer because I really need this.
